## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This technical report presents the results of groundwater plume delineation and flow direction analysis conducted at and downgradient from the W.R. Grace Company facility located at 201 Montvale Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts. The investigation was undertaken to determine the extent and migration pathways of chlorinated solvent contamination originating from the Grace facility and its potential impact on municipal water supply Wells G and H.

Field investigations conducted between October 15 and November 30, 1981, have identified a significant groundwater contamination plume containing trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) extending approximately 2,400 feet downgradient from the Grace facility toward the Aberjona River valley. Groundwater flow modeling indicates that contaminated groundwater from the Grace site follows a preferential flow path that intersects the capture zones of municipal Wells G and H.

The findings presented in this report establish a clear hydrogeologic connection between industrial solvent disposal practices at the W.R. Grace facility and contamination detected in the municipal water supply wells serving East Woburn residents.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background

The W.R. Grace Company has operated a chemical manufacturing facility at 201 Montvale Avenue in Woburn, Massachusetts since 1954. The facility, operated through its Cryovac division, manufactures food packaging materials and utilizes significant quantities of chlorinated solvents including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene in its production processes.

Municipal water supply Wells G and H, located approximately 0.8 miles southeast of the Grace facility, began operation in 1964 and 1966 respectively. In May 1979, routine testing by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health detected chlorinated organic compounds in both wells, leading to their temporary closure. Subsequent testing has confirmed the presence of TCE at concentrations up to 400 parts per billion and PCE at concentrations up to 43 parts per billion in water samples from these wells.

### 1.2 Scope of Investigation

This investigation was commissioned to:

1. Delineate the extent of groundwater contamination originating from the W.R. Grace facility
2. Determine groundwater flow directions and velocities in the study area
3. Evaluate the hydrogeologic connection between the Grace facility and Wells G and H
4. Assess the timing and magnitude of contaminant transport to the municipal wells

## 2. SITE GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY

### 2.1 Regional Geology

The study area is located within the Aberjona River valley, a north-south trending glacial valley filled with unconsolidated sediments. The regional stratigraphy consists of:

- **Surface Layer:** 2-8 feet of fill material and organic soils
- **Upper Aquifer:** 15-35 feet of fine to medium sand with intermittent silt lenses
- **Confining Layer:** 5-15 feet of glacial till and clay
- **Lower Aquifer:** 20-40 feet of coarse sand and gravel
- **Bedrock:** Weathered granite and metamorphic rocks at depths of 60-90 feet

### 2.2 Groundwater Flow System

Groundwater in the upper aquifer flows generally from northwest to southeast at an average gradient of 0.003 ft/ft. Hydraulic conductivity values determined from slug tests range from 8.5 × 10⁻⁴ to 2.1 × 10⁻³ cm/sec, with an average of 1.4 × 10⁻³ cm/sec.

Groundwater velocities calculated using the Darcy equation range from 0.18 to 0.45 feet per day, with an average velocity of 0.31 feet per day. These velocities indicate that groundwater travel time from the Grace facility to Wells G and H ranges from 12 to 18 years.

## 3. METHODOLOGY

### 3.1 Monitoring Well Installation

A total of 23 monitoring wells were installed using hollow-stem auger drilling techniques. Wells were constructed with 2-inch diameter PVC casing and screens, with sand pack and bentonite seal installation following EPA guidelines. Well locations were surveyed to within ±0.1 feet horizontal and ±0.01 feet vertical accuracy.

### 3.2 Groundwater Sampling and Analysis

Groundwater samples were collected using dedicated Teflon tubing and peristaltic pumps to minimize cross-contamination. All samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds using EPA Method 601 by Acton Environmental Laboratory, a certified facility.

### 3.3 Aquifer Testing

Slug tests were performed on all monitoring wells to determine hydraulic conductivity values. A 24-hour pumping test was conducted on monitoring well MW-15 with observation wells MW-14, MW-16, and MW-17 to evaluate aquifer properties and capture zone characteristics.

## 4. RESULTS AND FINDINGS

### 4.1 Contaminant Distribution

**Table 1: Groundwater Analytical Results (November 1981)**

| Well ID | TCE (ppb) | PCE (ppb) | Distance from Grace (ft) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| MW-01   | 3,200     | 850       | 150                     |
| MW-03   | 2,100     | 620       | 380                     |
| MW-07   | 1,800     | 490       | 720                     |
| MW-12   | 950       | 280       | 1,200                   |
| MW-15   | 420       | 125       | 1,800                   |
| MW-18   | 180       | 65        | 2,100                   |
| MW-21   | 85        | 28        | 2,400                   |

The contamination plume exhibits classic characteristics of a point source release with highest concentrations near the Grace facility and decreasing concentrations downgradient. The plume extends approximately 2,400 feet southeast from the facility toward the Aberjona River.

### 4.2 Flow Direction Analysis

Groundwater flow direction was determined through construction of potentiometric surface maps based on water level measurements from all monitoring wells. Flow is consistently toward the southeast, following the natural topographic gradient toward the Aberjona River valley.

**Key Flow Parameters:**
- Average hydraulic gradient: 0.003 ft/ft
- Flow direction: 135° from north (southeast)
- Average linear velocity: 0.31 ft/day
- Estimated travel time to Wells G and H: 12-18 years

### 4.3 Capture Zone Analysis

Pumping test data and flow modeling indicate that Wells G and H create significant cones of depression that extend upgradient toward the Grace facility. The combined capture zone of both wells encompasses the contamination plume pathway, confirming that groundwater flow from the Grace site is intercepted by the municipal wells.

## 5. DISCUSSION

### 5.1 Source Area Characteristics

Field observations and analytical data indicate that the primary source of contamination is located in the southeastern portion of the Grace facility property, in the vicinity of former waste disposal areas and solvent storage tanks. Soil sampling in this area has revealed TCE concentrations exceeding 1,000 mg/kg, indicating significant subsurface contamination.

### 5.2 Transport Mechanisms

The migration of chlorinated solvents from the Grace facility to Wells G and H occurs through several mechanisms:

1. **Advective Transport:** Bulk groundwater flow carries dissolved contaminants downgradient
2. **Dispersion:** Mechanical and molecular dispersion causes plume spreading
3. **Preferential Flow Paths:** Sandy
