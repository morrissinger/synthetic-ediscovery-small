## CHIEF COMPLAINT

Six-year-old white male presents with a three-week history of progressive fatigue, pallor, and intermittent fever, referred for evaluation of suspected hematologic malignancy following abnormal complete blood count.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

James Anderson was in his usual state of good health until approximately three weeks ago when his mother, Mrs. Anne Anderson, noted increasing fatigue and decreased activity level. The child, who had previously been very active and playful, began complaining of tiredness and requesting to rest frequently during play. Mrs. Anderson also observed progressive pallor, particularly noticeable around the eyes and lips.

Over the past ten days, James has experienced intermittent low-grade fevers, with temperatures ranging from 99.8°F to 101.2°F. The fevers have been accompanied by decreased appetite and occasional complaints of leg pain, particularly in the evening hours. Mrs. Anderson reports that James has been more irritable than usual and has had difficulty sleeping through the night.

The family sought medical attention at Winchester Hospital on January 20, 1972, where Dr. Robert Feldman ordered laboratory studies. The complete blood count revealed significant abnormalities prompting immediate referral to our pediatric hematology-oncology service.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

James was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Birth weight was 7 pounds, 4 ounces. He has met all developmental milestones appropriately and has been in excellent health with only minor upper respiratory infections typical for his age group. Immunizations are current per standard schedule.

## FAMILY HISTORY

No known family history of hematologic malignancies, bleeding disorders, or other significant medical conditions. Both parents are in good health. The family has resided at their current address in East Woburn since 1968.

## SOCIAL HISTORY

James lives with both parents in a single-family home. He attends kindergarten at the Hurld School in Woburn and has been performing well academically and socially until the recent onset of symptoms. The family obtains their domestic water supply from the municipal water system.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

**Vital Signs:** Temperature 100.4°F, Pulse 110, Respirations 24, Blood Pressure 95/60, Weight 42 pounds (25th percentile), Height 44 inches (50th percentile)

**General Appearance:** James appears chronically ill with marked pallor and decreased activity level. He is cooperative but appears fatigued.

**Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat:** Marked conjunctival pallor noted bilaterally. Oral mucosa pale. No oral lesions or bleeding observed. Throat clear.

**Lymphatic:** Palpable lymphadenopathy noted in bilateral cervical and axillary regions. Largest nodes measure approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, firm, mobile, and non-tender.

**Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm with Grade II/VI systolic murmur at left sternal border, consistent with flow murmur secondary to anemia.

**Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No respiratory distress noted.

**Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender. Spleen palpable 3 cm below left costal margin. Liver edge palpable 2 cm below right costal margin.

**Extremities:** No edema or joint swelling. Patient complains of tenderness to palpation over bilateral tibias.

**Neurologic:** Alert and oriented. No focal deficits noted.

## LABORATORY STUDIES

**Complete Blood Count (January 20, 1972):**
- White Blood Cell Count: 45,000/mm³ (Normal: 5,000-15,000)
- Hemoglobin: 6.2 g/dL (Normal: 11.5-14.0)
- Hematocrit: 18.5% (Normal: 34-42%)
- Platelet Count: 28,000/mm³ (Normal: 150,000-400,000)

**Peripheral Blood Smear:** Numerous immature white blood cells consistent with lymphoblasts. Marked reduction in normal white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.

**Basic Metabolic Panel:** Within normal limits except for mild elevation of lactate dehydrogenase at 485 U/L (Normal: 200-400).

## BONE MARROW EXAMINATION

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed on January 25, 1972, under conscious sedation. The procedure was well-tolerated by the patient.

**Findings:** Hypercellular bone marrow with 85% lymphoblasts. Normal hematopoietic elements markedly reduced. Cytologic features consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, L1 morphology by French-American-British classification.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

**Primary Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

James Anderson presents with classic findings of acute lymphoblastic leukemia including progressive symptoms of bone marrow failure (fatigue, pallor, fever), physical findings of leukemic infiltration (lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly), and laboratory confirmation with peripheral blood and bone marrow studies.

**Immediate Management:**
1. Admission to pediatric hematology-oncology service for initiation of chemotherapy
2. Blood product support as needed for severe anemia and thrombocytopenia
3. Infection precautions given neutropenia
4. Pain management for bone pain

**Treatment Plan:**
Induction chemotherapy will be initiated using a standard protocol including vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase. The family has been counseled regarding the diagnosis, treatment plan, and prognosis. With current treatment protocols, approximately 60-70% of children with ALL can achieve long-term remission.

**Follow-up:**
James will remain hospitalized during the induction phase of treatment. Regular monitoring of blood counts, chemistry panels, and clinical status will be performed. The family will receive ongoing support from our nursing staff and social services.

I have discussed these findings extensively with Mrs. Anne Anderson, who demonstrates good understanding of the diagnosis and treatment plan. She has expressed commitment to the treatment regimen and has been provided with educational materials regarding acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children.

The child has tolerated the initial procedures well, though he has experienced some discomfort during the bone marrow examination. Pain management protocols have been implemented to ensure his comfort during treatment.

**Prognosis:** Guarded. While acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children has shown improving outcomes with current treatment protocols, the disease remains serious with significant treatment-related risks.
