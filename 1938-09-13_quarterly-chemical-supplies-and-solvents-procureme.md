### DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS

All chemical materials are to be delivered directly to our receiving area at the rear of the tannery building, accessible via the service road from Salem Street. Our receiving hours are Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and Saturday 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Please coordinate delivery times with our foreman, Michael Kowalski, at the above telephone number.

### STORAGE AND HANDLING REQUIREMENTS

The chlorinated solvents (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and carbon tetrachloride) are to be stored in our designated chemical storage area in the basement level of the main building. These materials will be utilized primarily for our hide degreasing operations and equipment cleaning procedures. The chromium compounds will be stored in our tanning solution preparation area for immediate use in our leather processing operations.

### WASTE DISPOSAL ARRANGEMENTS

As discussed in our previous correspondence, spent solvents and chemical residues from our operations will continue to be disposed of through our established procedures. The waste materials are currently being directed to our settling ponds located on the property's eastern boundary, adjacent to the Aberjona River drainage area. This system has proven adequate for managing our production waste volumes and maintains compliance with current municipal requirements.

We anticipate that our chemical consumption patterns will remain consistent with historical usage levels, as our production schedule indicates steady demand for finished leather goods through the remainder of 1938 and into 1939. The economic conditions have stabilized our customer base, and we expect to maintain current production levels.

Please confirm receipt of this purchase order and provide estimated delivery date for the complete shipment. If any items are temporarily unavailable, please notify us immediately so that we may arrange alternative sourcing if necessary.

We appreciate your continued reliable service to our operation and look forward to maintaining our business relationship.

Very truly yours,

**Harold M. Peterson**  
Purchasing Manager  
John J. Riley Company
