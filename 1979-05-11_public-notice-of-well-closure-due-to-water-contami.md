## PUBLIC NOTICE OF EMERGENCY WELL CLOSURE

**Date:** May 11, 1979  
**Notice No:** WD-79-015  
**Distribution:** East Woburn Residents - Water District Areas 3 & 4

---

### IMMEDIATE CLOSURE OF MUNICIPAL WELLS G AND H

**TO:** All Residents Served by Wells G and H  
**FROM:** Woburn Water Department  
**RE:** Emergency Closure Due to Water Quality Concerns

---

**EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY**, the City of Woburn Water Department is **PERMANENTLY CLOSING** municipal Wells G and H located on Olympia Avenue in East Woburn. This action is being taken based on recent water quality testing results that have identified the presence of volatile organic compounds in concentrations that exceed acceptable standards for public consumption.

### Background Information

Wells G and H have served as supplemental water sources for the eastern sections of Woburn since their installation in 1964 and 1966 respectively. These wells have provided water service to approximately 2,800 residents in the East Woburn area, including neighborhoods along Salem Street, Washington Street, Maple Street, and surrounding residential areas.

On April 23, 1979, routine water quality testing conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health revealed the presence of trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in water samples from both wells. Follow-up testing conducted on May 2 and May 8, 1979, confirmed these initial findings, with contamination levels measuring:

- **Well G:** TCE at 267 parts per billion, PCE at 21 parts per billion
- **Well H:** TCE at 183 parts per billion, PCE at 12 parts per billion

These levels significantly exceed the recommended maximum contaminant levels established by federal and state health authorities.

### Immediate Actions Taken

1. **Well Shutdown:** Both wells were immediately taken offline as of 6:00 AM on May 11, 1979
2. **Water Supply Transition:** Water service to affected areas is being maintained through increased pumping from Wells A, B, C, D, E, and F
3. **System Flushing:** Water mains in the affected service areas are being systematically flushed to clear contaminated water
4. **Health Notification:** The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has been notified and is coordinating with local health officials

### Health Advisory

While the full health implications of this contamination are still being evaluated by state health officials, residents who have been receiving water from Wells G and H are advised to:

- **Continue using municipal water** for all household purposes, as the contaminated wells are now offline
- **Contact your physician** if you have specific health concerns related to past water consumption
- **Monitor future communications** from the Water Department and local health authorities

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has indicated that short-term exposure to these chemicals at the detected levels does not pose an immediate health emergency, but long-term consumption should be avoided.

### Investigation and Remediation

The Water Department is working closely with state environmental officials to:

1. **Identify the source** of chemical contamination in the groundwater supply
2. **Assess the extent** of aquifer contamination in the East Woburn area  
3. **Develop remediation strategies** to address the contamination source
4. **Evaluate options** for future water supply to the affected service areas

Preliminary investigations suggest that the contamination may be related to industrial activities in the Aberjona River Valley area, including facilities operated by manufacturing companies in the vicinity of the wells.

### Water Service Continuity

**Water service will NOT be interrupted** to East Woburn residents. The remaining six municipal wells have sufficient capacity to maintain normal water pressure and supply throughout the affected service areas. Residents may experience temporary fluctuations in water pressure during the transition period as system adjustments are made.

### Future Communications

The Water Department will provide regular updates to affected residents regarding:

- Progress of the contamination investigation
- Results of ongoing water quality testing
- Long-term plans for water service in East Woburn
- Any additional health advisories from state authorities

**Next scheduled update:** May 25, 1979
