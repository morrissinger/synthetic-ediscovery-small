## SECTION I: OPERATIONAL HISTORY DISCLOSURE

**1.1 Chemical Usage Documentation**

**1.2 Waste Disposal Practices**  
The Company acknowledges that waste disposal practices employed during the period 1909-1963 included the following methodologies, which were standard industry practices during their respective implementation periods:

- Direct discharge of spent tanning liquors and process waters to surface drainage systems, including intermittent discharge to the Aberjona River system
- On-site burial of solid waste materials, including hair, flesh, and other organic byproducts of hide processing, in designated areas of the property
- Evaporation pond systems for concentration of liquid wastes prior to disposal
- Periodic burning of combustible waste materials in designated areas of the facility property

## SECTION II: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**2.1 Groundwater Considerations**  
The Board acknowledges that the Riley Tannery property is situated in proximity to groundwater resources that may serve municipal or private water supply purposes. While municipal Wells G and H referenced in recent city planning documents were not in existence during the operational period covered by this resolution, the Company recognizes that subsurface contamination from historical operations may pose potential risks to future water supply development in the area.

**2.2 Soil Contamination Potential**  
Based on the industrial activities conducted at the facility over the fifty-four year operational period, the Company acknowledges the potential for soil contamination in the following areas:

**3.2 Disclosure of Known Issues**  
The Company hereby discloses the following specific incidents or conditions that may be relevant to the assessment of environmental liability:

- **1947 Chemical Spill**: Approximately 500 gallons of chromium sulfate solution was inadvertently released during tank transfer operations, with cleanup conducted according to then-current industry practices
- **1952 Drainage System Modification**: Installation of improved drainage systems to direct process waters away from the main facility building, with discharge routed to existing surface water channels
- **1958 Storage Tank Replacement**: Replacement of underground storage tanks for industrial solvents, with old tanks abandoned in place according to standard practice of the period
- **1961 Waste Disposal Area Expansion**: Extension of on-site waste disposal areas to accommodate increased production volumes, located in the southwestern portion of the property
