### ENVIRONMENTAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ASSESSMENT

**Soil Composition:** The subject property consists primarily of sandy loam with underlying glacial till deposits. Percolation tests conducted in March 1970 indicate moderate to high infiltration rates, with groundwater encountered at depths ranging from 12 to 18 feet below surface grade.

**Drainage Characteristics:** Surface water drainage flows in a generally easterly direction toward the Aberjona River watershed. The property exhibits natural depression areas in the central and eastern portions, with elevations ranging from 98 feet above sea level at the northwestern boundary to 89 feet above sea level at the southeastern corner.

**Proximity to Water Resources:** The eastern boundary of the subject property lies approximately 1,200 feet west-northwest of municipal water supply Wells G and H, which serve residential areas in East Woburn. The property is situated within the contributing watershed area for these municipal wells.

### HISTORICAL LAND USE ANALYSIS

**Previous Ownership:** Records indicate that prior to 1965, portions of this property were utilized for agricultural purposes, specifically dairy farming operations conducted by the Hartwell Family Trust. Agricultural use ceased in 1964 when the property was subdivided and sold for industrial development.

**Existing Improvements:** As of the date of this assessment, the property contains:
- One steel-frame industrial building (approximately 8,500 square feet)
- Concrete loading dock with railroad siding access
- Gravel access roads and parking areas
- Chain-link perimeter fencing along railroad boundary

**Current Industrial Operations:** The property currently hosts chemical processing and storage operations conducted under lease agreements with multiple industrial tenants. These operations include the handling, processing, and temporary storage of industrial solvents and chemical compounds used in manufacturing processes.

---

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT

**Municipal Compliance:** The current industrial uses appear to conform to the IM-2 zoning designation established by the City of Woburn Zoning Ordinance of 1968. However, certain storage and disposal practices may require additional municipal permits or modifications to existing special use permits.

**State Environmental Considerations:** The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has indicated increased scrutiny of industrial operations within municipal water supply protection areas. Property owners and lessees should be advised that future regulations may impose additional restrictions on chemical storage and waste disposal activities.

**Federal Railroad Administration:** Due to the property's direct adjacency to active railroad right-of-way, any expansion of industrial operations or construction of additional structures will require coordination with federal railroad safety authorities.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT

**Infrastructure Improvements:** Future development of this property should include installation of proper containment systems for any chemical storage or processing operations. The sandy soil composition and proximity to municipal water supplies necessitate enhanced environmental safeguards.

**Access and Transportation:** The existing railroad siding provides excellent access for bulk material transport, but truck access via Washington Street may require road improvements to accommodate increased industrial traffic.

**Environmental Monitoring:** Given the property's location within the watershed contributing to municipal water supplies, regular monitoring of soil and groundwater conditions is recommended to ensure compliance with emerging environmental protection standards.

---

### ENCUMBRANCES AND TITLE CONSIDERATIONS

**Easements:** The Boston & Maine Railroad holds a perpetual easement for railroad operations along the northern boundary. Massachusetts Electric Company maintains utility easements along Washington Street frontage.

**Deed Restrictions:** No significant deed restrictions limit industrial use of the property, though future transfers may be subject to environmental disclosure requirements under proposed state legislation.

**Tax Assessment:** Current assessed value of $47,500 reflects industrial land use potential. Property taxes are current as of the assessment date.
