## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the analytical results of groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells in the vicinity of former municipal Wells G and H in East Woburn, Massachusetts. The analysis was conducted in response to the closure of these wells in May 1979 following detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the municipal water supply. The investigation confirms significant contamination of the local aquifer with trichloroethylene (TCE) and other industrial solvents, with concentrations exceeding federal drinking water standards by factors of 10 to 50.

## INTRODUCTION

Wells G and H served as supplemental municipal water sources for East Woburn from 1964 and 1966 respectively until their closure in May 1979. The wells were located in the Aberjona River Valley, drawing water from an unconfined aquifer at depths of 60-80 feet below ground surface. Initial contamination testing in May 1979 revealed the presence of chlorinated organic compounds, prompting immediate well closure and initiation of this comprehensive groundwater investigation.

The purpose of this study is to:
1. Quantify the extent and concentration of groundwater contamination
2. Identify potential sources of contamination
3. Assess the migration patterns of contaminants in the aquifer
4. Provide data to support regulatory and legal actions

## METHODOLOGY

### Sample Collection

Groundwater samples were collected from twelve monitoring wells installed between October 1979 and February 1980. Sample locations were selected based on:
- Proximity to Wells G and H
- Location of known industrial facilities
- Groundwater flow patterns determined by potentiometric surveys
- Accessibility for drilling operations

All samples were collected using EPA-approved protocols:
- Wells were purged of three casing volumes prior to sampling
- Samples collected in pre-cleaned 40ml amber glass vials with Teflon-lined caps
- Samples preserved at 4°C and analyzed within 14 days of collection
- Chain of custody procedures maintained throughout

### Analytical Methods

Volatile organic compounds were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) following EPA Method 624 (proposed). The analytical system consisted of:
- Hewlett-Packard 5840A Gas Chromatograph
- Finnigan 4023 Mass Spectrometer
- 60m x 0.75mm fused silica capillary column (DB-624)

Detection limits for target compounds:
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 1.0 μg/L
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 1.0 μg/L
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 1.0 μg/L
- Chloroform: 2.0 μg/L
- Carbon tetrachloride: 1.0 μg/L

Quality control measures included analysis of blanks, duplicates, and spiked samples with each analytical batch.

**Federal Drinking Water Standards (proposed):**
- TCE: 5 μg/L
- PCE: 5 μg/L
- TCA: 200 μg/L
- CHCl₃: 100 μg/L
- CCl₄: 5 μg/L

### Spatial Analysis

The highest concentrations of volatile organic compounds were detected in monitoring well MW-7, located approximately 200 meters northeast of the W.R. Grace Company facility at 369 Washington Street. This well showed TCE concentrations of 512 μg/L, more than 100 times the proposed federal drinking water standard.

A distinct contamination plume extends from the area near the Grace facility in a southwesterly direction toward Wells G and H, following the natural groundwater flow gradient of approximately 0.003 feet per foot. The plume appears to bifurcate around a bedrock high, with one arm affecting Well G and another affecting Well H.

Secondary contamination was detected near the John J. Riley Company tannery property at 228 Salem Street, though at lower concentrations than observed near the Grace facility. This suggests multiple potential sources of contamination in the study area.

### Temporal Trends

Comparison with limited historical data from the May 1979 well closure sampling indicates relatively stable contamination levels over the 10-month period, suggesting:
1. Continuing source inputs to the aquifer
2. Low natural attenuation rates for chlorinated compounds
3. Potential for long-term persistence of contamination

## DISCUSSION

### Source Identification

The spatial distribution of contamination strongly suggests that the primary source area is located upgradient (northeast) of Wells G and H, in the vicinity of the W.R. Grace Company facility. The chemical signature, dominated by trichloroethylene with lesser amounts of tetrachloroethylene and other chlorinated solvents, is consistent with industrial degreasing and cleaning operations.

The detection of contamination near the Riley tannery suggests either a secondary source or migration of the primary plume. Historical land use information indicates both facilities have used chlorinated solvents in their operations over the past two decades.

### Environmental Fate and Transport

Trichloroethylene and other detected compounds are:
- **Highly mobile** in groundwater due to low soil adsorption
- **Persistent** under anaerobic groundwater conditions
- **Dense** relative to water, potentially forming separate phase pools

The contamination pattern suggests disposal or spillage of solvents at or near ground surface, followed by vertical migration through the unsaturated zone and lateral transport in the saturated zone following groundwater flow patterns.

### Health Implications

The detected concentrations of volatile organic compounds significantly exceed proposed federal drinking water standards. Trichloroethylene, the predominant contaminant, has been associated with:
