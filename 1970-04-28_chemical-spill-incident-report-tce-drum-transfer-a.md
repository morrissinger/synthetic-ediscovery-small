# INCIDENT REPORT

**TO:** William J. Patterson, Operations Director  
**FROM:** Robert M. Hensley, Facility Safety Officer  
**DATE:** April 28, 1970  
**RE:** Chemical Spill Incident - TCE Drum Transfer Accident  
**INCIDENT NO:** CRY-70-047

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

On April 27, 1970, at approximately 2:45 PM, a significant chemical spill occurred during the transfer of trichloroethylene (TCE) drums from the storage area to the production floor at our East Woburn facility. An estimated 55 gallons of TCE was released when a forklift operator punctured a drum while attempting to move it from the outdoor storage area. The spill resulted in immediate evacuation of personnel from the affected area and required emergency containment procedures.

## INCIDENT DETAILS

**Date/Time:** April 27, 1970, 2:45 PM  
**Location:** Outdoor chemical storage area, northeast corner of facility property  
**Weather Conditions:** Clear, 62°F, light wind from southwest  
**Personnel Involved:** Thomas Kowalski (forklift operator), James Murphy (supervisor), Michael Santos (maintenance)

The incident occurred when operator Kowalski was attempting to relocate drums of TCE from the outdoor storage area to make room for an incoming shipment. While maneuvering drum #TCE-4471 (manufactured by Dow Chemical Company, lot #DC-8847), the forklift tines punctured the drum's sidewall approximately 18 inches from the bottom. The puncture created a 3-inch gash, causing rapid discharge of the drum's contents.

Supervisor Murphy immediately ordered evacuation of the area and activated emergency spill procedures. The TCE flowed across the concrete pad and into the adjacent gravel area before containment barriers could be fully deployed. Approximately 20 gallons were recovered using absorbent materials and portable pumping equipment. The remaining 35 gallons soaked into the gravel substrate and surrounding soil.

## IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACTIONS

1. **Personnel Evacuation:** All workers within 100-foot radius evacuated within 3 minutes
2. **Spill Containment:** Sand barriers deployed around perimeter, absorbent pads placed
3. **Ventilation:** Portable fans positioned to direct vapors away from buildings
4. **Recovery Operations:** Liquid TCE pumped into emergency containers
5. **Soil Remediation:** Contaminated gravel and topsoil removed to depth of 2 feet
6. **Documentation:** Photographs taken, measurements recorded, samples collected

## CONTRIBUTING FACTORS

Investigation revealed several factors that contributed to this incident:

**Equipment Issues:** The forklift (Model FG-25, Serial #4429) had been reported by operators as having "sticky" hydraulic controls that occasionally caused jerky movements. Maintenance records show this issue was logged on April 15, 1970, but repair work had been scheduled for the following week due to parts availability.

**Storage Configuration:** The outdoor storage area contains drums stacked two-high on wooden pallets. The configuration requires operators to lift drums from the upper level, creating stability challenges during transfer operations. The punctured drum was positioned on the upper tier of stack #7.

**Training Deficiency:** Operator Kowalski completed forklift certification in January 1970 but had not received specific training on handling chemical containers. Standard operating procedures for TCE handling specify use of drum cradles or special attachments, which were not utilized.

**Procedural Non-Compliance:** Current safety protocols require two-person teams for chemical drum transfers, with one person serving as spotter. This procedure was not followed due to staffing constraints in the shipping department.

## ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

The spilled TCE represents our largest chemical release incident to date. While immediate containment efforts recovered a significant portion of the material, the environmental impact requires ongoing monitoring:

- **Soil Contamination:** Approximately 4 cubic yards of contaminated soil and gravel removed
- **Groundwater Risk:** The spill location is approximately 200 feet from the facility's northeastern property boundary
- **Vapor Emissions:** Air monitoring detected TCE concentrations of 150 ppm immediately following the incident, declining to 25 ppm within 2 hours

Contaminated materials have been packaged in sealed drums for disposal through our authorized waste contractor, Industrial Waste Management Corp. Soil samples from the excavated area have been submitted to Analytical Services Inc. for TCE concentration analysis.

## CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IMPLEMENTED

**Immediate Actions (Completed):**
- Forklift #4429 removed from service pending hydraulic system repair
- All chemical drum transfers suspended until procedure review completed
- Additional spill response equipment positioned in storage area
- Staff briefing conducted on April 28, 1970

**Planned Actions (Target Completion):**
- Forklift hydraulic system repair and recertification (May 5, 1970)
- Installation of drum cradle attachments for all material handling equipment (May 15, 1970)
- Comprehensive chemical handling training for all operators (May 30, 1970)
- Revision of storage area layout to eliminate upper-tier stacking (June 15, 1970)

## REGULATORY NOTIFICATIONS

Per company policy and applicable regulations, the following notifications have been made:

- **Massachusetts Department of Public Health:** Verbal notification April 27, written report submitted April 28
- **Woburn Fire Department:** On-scene notification during incident response
- **Corporate Environmental Affairs:** Telephone briefing to headquarters April 27
- **Insurance Carrier:** Claim notification submitted April 28

## COST IMPACT

Preliminary cost estimates for this incident include:

- **Emergency Response:** $1,200 (personnel overtime, equipment rental)
- **Material Loss:** $850 (55 gallons TCE at $15.45/gallon)
- **Cleanup and Disposal:** $2,400 (soil removal, waste disposal, analytical testing)
- **Equipment Repair:** $650 (forklift hydraulic system)
- **Production Delay:** $3,200 (4-hour shutdown of affected operations)

**Total Estimated Cost:** $8,300

## RECOMMENDATIONS

To prevent recurrence of similar incidents, I recommend the following actions:

1. **Equipment Maintenance:** Establish priority repair protocols for safety-critical equipment issues
2. **Storage Redesign:** Convert to single-tier drum storage with improved accessibility
3. **Training Enhancement:** Develop specialized certification program for chemical material handlers
4. **Procedure Enforcement:** Implement supervisor verification system for safety protocol compliance
5. **Emergency Preparedness:** Expand spill response equipment inventory and conduct quarterly drills

This incident, while serious, was contained through prompt response and did not result in personnel injury. However, the potential for groundwater contamination and the significant cleanup costs underscore the importance of preventing such occurrences through improved procedures and equipment maintenance.

I will continue monitoring the remediation efforts and provide weekly updates until the situation is fully resolved. Please contact me if you require additional information or clarification regarding any aspect of this incident.
