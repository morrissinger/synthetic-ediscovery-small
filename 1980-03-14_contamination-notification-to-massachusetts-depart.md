**RE:** FORMAL NOTIFICATION OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION - EAST WOBURN MUNICIPAL WELLS G AND H - POTENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, hereby provides formal notification to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health regarding confirmed volatile organic compound contamination in the East Woburn municipal water supply system. Based upon comprehensive analytical testing conducted between May 1979 and February 1980, Wells G and H have been determined to contain hazardous concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and other chlorinated organic solvents in violation of federal drinking water standards.

This notification is submitted pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq.) and Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 5, requiring immediate coordination between federal and state health authorities when public water supplies pose imminent threats to human health.

## II. CONTAMINATION FINDINGS

### A. Well Identification and Service Area
Municipal Wells G and H, operated by the City of Woburn Department of Public Works, have served as supplemental water sources for eastern Woburn neighborhoods since 1964 and 1966 respectively. These wells draw from the Aberjona River Valley aquifer and have historically provided approximately 25-30% of the municipal water supply to residential areas including Pine Street, Salem Street, Washington Street, and adjacent neighborhoods.

### B. Analytical Results
Laboratory analysis conducted by EPA-certified facilities has confirmed the following contamination levels:

**Well G (Sample Date: February 15, 1980)**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 267 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 21 parts per billion
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 56 parts per billion
- Chloroform: 12 parts per billion

**Well H (Sample Date: February 18, 1980)**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 183 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 8 parts per billion
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 31 parts per billion

These concentrations substantially exceed proposed federal maximum contaminant levels for public water systems. The presence of multiple chlorinated solvents indicates industrial source contamination consistent with manufacturing and waste disposal activities within the wellhead protection area.

### C. Source Investigation
Preliminary investigation has identified multiple potential contamination sources within the Aberjona River Valley watershed:

1. **W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Division** (369 Washington Street): Chemical packaging operations utilizing trichloroethylene and other organic solvents. Site inspection revealed evidence of historical waste disposal practices including drum storage areas and potential soil contamination.

2. **Beatrice Foods/John J. Riley Tannery** (228 Salem Street): Leather processing operations historically utilizing chlorinated solvents for degreasing. Adjacent undeveloped property shows evidence of fill material and potential waste disposal.

3. **Additional Industrial Sources**: Investigation continuing regarding other manufacturing facilities within the groundwater flow path to Wells G and H.

## III. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS

### A. Exposure Assessment
Based upon well production records and population data, EPA estimates that approximately 5,000 residents have been exposed to contaminated water since well operation commenced. Peak exposure periods correspond to maximum well pumping during summer months and drought conditions when Wells G and H comprised higher percentages of total municipal supply.

### B. Health Effects Concerns
The volatile organic compounds detected in Wells G and H are associated with significant health risks:

- **Trichloroethylene**: Suspected human carcinogen; liver and kidney toxicity; central nervous system effects
- **Tetrachloroethylene**: Probable human carcinogen; neurological effects; reproductive toxicity
- **1,1,1-Trichloroethane**: Central nervous system depression; cardiac sensitization

Of particular concern are potential effects on vulnerable populations including pregnant women, infants, and children who may be more susceptible to chemical exposure.

### C. Epidemiological Considerations
EPA has received reports from local residents regarding elevated incidence of childhood leukemia and other health conditions in neighborhoods served by Wells G and H. While causal relationships have not been established, the temporal and geographic correlation warrants immediate epidemiological investigation by state health authorities.

## IV. REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS

### A. Federal Statutory Framework
This notification is issued under authority of:
- Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq.
- Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (proposed)
- Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.

### B. State Coordination Requirements
Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 5 establishes the Department of Public Health's authority to investigate and take action regarding public water supply contamination. EPA requests immediate coordination to:

1. Conduct comprehensive health impact assessment for affected populations
2. Establish exposure registry for residents served by Wells G and H
3. Coordinate with local health officials regarding medical surveillance
4. Develop public notification protocols

### C. Municipal Obligations
The City of Woburn, as the public water supplier, has continuing obligations under state and federal law to:
- Provide safe drinking water meeting all applicable standards
- Notify consumers of contamination exceeding maximum allowable levels
- Take corrective action to eliminate contamination sources
- Implement alternative water supply measures as necessary

## V. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### A. Well Closure
EPA strongly recommends immediate closure of Wells G and H pending comprehensive remedial investigation. Continued operation poses unacceptable risk to public health given documented contamination levels.

### B. Alternative Water Supply
Coordination is required to ensure adequate alternative water supply for affected neighborhoods. Options may include:
- Increased pumping from uncontaminated municipal wells
- Interconnection with neighboring water systems
- Temporary bottled water distribution for high-risk populations

### C. Public Notification
Joint federal-state public notification should be implemented immediately to inform affected residents of:
- Nature and extent of contamination
- Health risks associated with exposure
- Protective measures and alternative water sources
- Ongoing investigation activities

## VI. ONGOING INVESTIGATION

EPA is conducting comprehensive investigation activities including:

### A. Hydrogeological Assessment
- Groundwater flow modeling to determine contaminant migration pathways
- Installation of monitoring wells to define plume boundaries
- Aquifer testing to assess remediation feasibility

### B. Source Characterization
- Detailed site investigations at identified potential sources
- Soil and groundwater sampling at industrial facilities
- Historical waste disposal practice documentation

### C. Remedial Planning
- Evaluation of treatment technologies for groundwater remediation
- Assessment of alternative water supply options
- Development of long-term protection strategies

## VII. COORDINATION WITH POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES

EPA has initiated contact with identified potentially responsible parties including:

- **W.R. Grace Company**: Corporate headquarters notified of potential liability under federal environmental statutes
- **Beatrice Foods Inc.**: Formal notification regarding John J. Riley tannery operations and associated property
- **Other Industrial Entities**: Investigation continuing regarding additional sources

These parties have legal obligations under federal and state law to:
- Cooperate with government investigation activities
- Provide access to historical operational and disposal records
- Participate in remedial action planning and implementation
- Bear financial responsibility for contamination cleanup

## VIII. REQUEST FOR STATE ACTION

EPA formally requests that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health:

1. **Immediate Health Assessment**: Conduct emergency evaluation of potential health impacts for residents served by Wells G and H

2. **Epidemiological Investigation**: Initiate comprehensive study of reported health conditions in affected neighborhoods
