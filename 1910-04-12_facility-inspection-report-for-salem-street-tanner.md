# FACILITY INSPECTION REPORT

**John J. Riley Company**  
**Salem Street Tannery Operations**  
**East Woburn, Massachusetts**

---

**TO:** Riley Company Board of Directors  
**FROM:** John J. Riley, General Manager  
**DATE:** April 12th, 1910  
**RE:** Quarterly Facility Inspection - Salem Street Operations

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I have completed the quarterly inspection of our Salem Street tannery facility as required by company policy and Massachusetts industrial regulations. This report documents the current state of operations, equipment condition, and compliance with applicable standards as of April 12th, 1910. Overall, the facility continues to operate within acceptable parameters for leather processing operations of this scale and type.

## FACILITY OVERVIEW

The Salem Street tannery, established in 1909, occupies approximately 2.3 acres at 228 Salem Street in East Woburn. The facility processes an average of 450 hides per week using standard chemical tanning methods employed throughout the Massachusetts leather industry. Current employment stands at 23 workers across two shifts, with production meeting projected quarterly targets.

## OPERATIONAL INSPECTION FINDINGS

### **Processing Equipment**

All primary tanning vats remain in serviceable condition. The six large soaking vats show normal wear consistent with daily chemical exposure. Minor repairs to vat No. 3 were completed last month following discovery of small leaks in the wooden joints. The lime pits continue to function adequately, though I recommend replacement of the wooden planking in pit No. 2 within the next six months.

The mechanical fleshing machines operate satisfactorily, with routine maintenance performed according to manufacturer specifications. Belt tension adjustments were made to machine No. 1 during this inspection period. Oil levels in all machinery remain adequate.

### **Chemical Storage and Handling**

Chemical inventory includes standard tanning materials: lime, salt, sulfuric acid, chromium compounds, and various finishing oils. Storage areas maintain proper separation of incompatible materials as established in our operational procedures. The acid storage shed shows some deterioration of wooden flooring, which I have scheduled for replacement next month.

Workers continue to follow established safety protocols for chemical handling, including use of protective clothing where practical. I observed proper procedures being followed during my inspection rounds on April 10th and 11th.

### **Waste Management Systems**

The facility's waste water system directs processing effluent through settling basins before discharge to the adjacent drainage channels leading toward the Aberjona River. The settling basins require periodic cleaning to maintain effectiveness, with the last cleaning completed in February. Solid waste materials, including hair, flesh, and spent lime, are collected for disposal at the designated areas east of the main building.

I note that current waste disposal methods align with standard industry practices throughout Massachusetts. The Commonwealth has not established specific regulations governing tannery waste beyond general sanitation requirements, and our methods are consistent with those employed by established operations in Salem, Lynn, and other leather manufacturing centers.

### **Structural Condition**

The main processing building remains structurally sound. The roof requires minor repairs to prevent water infiltration during heavy rains, particularly over the finishing area. Foundation walls show expected settling but no significant structural concerns.

The employee facilities, including the changing area and tool storage, are adequate for current workforce needs. Ventilation in the processing areas meets minimum requirements, though additional windows might improve working conditions during summer months.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

The facility operates in compliance with applicable Massachusetts industrial regulations and local ordinances. The most recent inspection by Woburn municipal authorities occurred in January 1910, with no violations noted. Fire safety equipment, including water barrels and sand buckets, are positioned throughout the facility as required.

Worker safety measures align with standard industry practices. While the Commonwealth has not yet established comprehensive industrial safety regulations, we maintain procedures consistent with recommendations from the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics and Labor.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The tannery's location provides suitable drainage for processing waste through natural channels toward the Aberjona River. This arrangement follows standard practice for industrial operations throughout the region. The soil composition appears adequate for current waste disposal methods, with no evidence of unusual ground conditions that would affect normal operations.

I have observed no adverse effects on adjacent properties or complaints from neighboring landowners regarding our operations. The facility's position within the established industrial corridor of East Woburn ensures compatibility with surrounding land uses.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on this inspection, I recommend the following actions:

1. **Immediate (Within 30 days):**
   - Replace deteriorated flooring in acid storage shed
   - Complete minor roof repairs over finishing area
   - Adjust belt tension on fleshing machine No. 2

2. **Short-term (Within 90 days):**
   - Replace wooden planking in lime pit No. 2
   - Install additional ventilation windows in main processing area
   - Update inventory tracking system for chemical supplies

3. **Long-term (Within 12 months):**
   - Consider expansion of settling basin capacity to accommodate projected production increases
   - Evaluate feasibility of mechanizing additional processing steps
   - Assess need for additional employee facilities if workforce expansion continues

## FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS

The recommended improvements will require approximately $340 in immediate expenditures and $750 in short-term investments. These costs are within normal operational budgets and should not affect quarterly profit projections.

Long-term improvements may require capital investment of $1,200-$1,500, which should be considered in next year's budget planning.

## CONCLUSION

The Salem Street tannery continues to operate effectively within established parameters. The facility meets current regulatory requirements and maintains production standards consistent with our business objectives. Regular maintenance and the recommended improvements will ensure continued reliable operations.

The tannery's strategic location and proven methods position the Riley Company well for continued success in the Massachusetts leather industry. Our commitment to proper facility management and worker safety reflects the responsible business practices that have characterized our operations since establishment.

I will continue quarterly inspections according to company policy and provide updates on implementation of these recommendations.
