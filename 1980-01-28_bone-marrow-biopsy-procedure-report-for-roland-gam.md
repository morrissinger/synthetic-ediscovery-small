## CLINICAL HISTORY

Roland Gamache is a 12-year-old Caucasian male who presents with a three-month history of progressive fatigue, recurrent infections, and easy bruising. Patient resides at 47 Pine Street in East Woburn with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Gerard Gamache. The family has lived at this address since 1965, utilizing municipal water services throughout this period.

Initial laboratory studies obtained by Dr. Chen on January 15, 1980, revealed significant hematologic abnormalities including:
- White Blood Cell Count: 2,100/μL (normal: 4,500-13,500)
- Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL (normal: 11.5-15.5)
- Hematocrit: 21% (normal: 34-40)
- Platelet Count: 45,000/μL (normal: 150,000-450,000)
- Peripheral blood smear: Presence of immature blast cells

Physical examination notable for pallor, petechial rash on bilateral lower extremities, and hepatosplenomegaly. Lymphadenopathy present in cervical and axillary regions.

Given the constellation of findings suggestive of hematologic malignancy, bone marrow biopsy was recommended for definitive diagnosis.

## PROCEDURE NOTE

**Indication:** Pancytopenia with circulating blast cells, rule out acute leukemia

**Procedure:** Bone marrow aspiration and core biopsy

**Site:** Right posterior iliac crest

**Anesthesia:** Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine

**Technique:** After obtaining informed consent from the patient's parents, the patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus position. The right posterior iliac crest was identified by palpation and marked. The area was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was administered to skin and periosteum using 5 mL of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine.

Using an 11-gauge Jamshidi needle, bone marrow aspiration was performed first. Approximately 2 mL of bone marrow was successfully aspirated and immediately prepared for morphologic examination, cytogenetics, and flow cytometry analysis. Multiple direct smears were prepared at bedside.

Subsequently, a core biopsy specimen measuring approximately 1.5 cm in length was obtained using the same needle. The specimen was immediately placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathologic examination.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications. Hemostasis was achieved with direct pressure, and a pressure dressing was applied.

## PRELIMINARY MORPHOLOGIC FINDINGS

**Bone Marrow Aspirate:**
- Cellularity: Markedly hypercellular (95-100%)
- Myeloid to Erythroid Ratio: 10:1 (normal 2-4:1)
- Blast cells comprise approximately 85% of nucleated cells
- Blast morphology: Medium to large cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, prominent nucleoli, and basophilic cytoplasm
- Auer rods identified in several blast cells
- Erythroid precursors: Markedly decreased
- Megakaryocytes: Rare, morphologically abnormal

**Peripheral Blood Review:**
- Confirmed presence of circulating blast cells (45% of white cell differential)
- Severe anemia with normocytic, normochromic red blood cells
- Thrombocytopenia with occasional large platelets

## PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS

Based on morphologic examination of bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood, findings are consistent with **Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)**, specifically French-American-British (FAB) classification M2 (acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation).

Final diagnosis pending:
- Histopathologic examination of core biopsy specimen
- Cytochemical stains (myeloperoxidase, Sudan Black B, PAS)
- Cytogenetic analysis
- Flow cytometry immunophenotyping

## CLINICAL CORRELATION

This case represents another instance of acute leukemia in a pediatric patient from the East Woburn area. Of particular concern is the apparent clustering of similar cases in children residing in neighborhoods served by municipal Wells G and H, which were closed in May 1979 due to chemical contamination.

Roland Gamache's residence at 47 Pine Street places him within the primary service area of these wells during their operational period from 1964-1979. The patient's family reports exclusive use of municipal water for drinking, cooking, and household purposes throughout their residency.

This case adds to the growing number of pediatric hematologic malignancies diagnosed in children from East Woburn neighborhoods, including:
- James Anderson (diagnosed 1972, deceased 1973)
- Kevin Kane Jr. (diagnosed 1978)
- Michael Zona (diagnosed 1979)
- Patrick Toomey (diagnosed 1979)
- Carl Robbins III (diagnosed 1979)

The temporal and geographic clustering of these cases warrants immediate attention from public health authorities and suggests a possible environmental etiology.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate oncologic consultation** for treatment planning
2. **Staging studies** including chest radiograph, lumbar puncture, and comprehensive metabolic panel
3. **Central line placement** in preparation for chemotherapy
4. **Family counseling** regarding diagnosis and treatment options
5. **Environmental health assessment** of patient's residence and exposure history
6. **Notification** of Massachusetts Department of Public Health regarding this case as part of ongoing cluster investigation

## DISPOSITION

Patient admitted to Pediatric Hematology/Oncology service under the care of Dr. Sarah Chen. Parents have been informed of preliminary diagnosis and prognosis. Social services consulted for family support.

Complete pathology report with final diagnosis and treatment recommendations to follow within 48-72 hours pending completion of ancillary studies.
