# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Thomas Sullivan, City Manager  
**FROM:** Robert F. McCarthy, Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** May 11, 1966  
**RE:** Completion of Well H Installation Project

## Project Completion Summary

I am pleased to report that the installation of Well H has been successfully completed as of May 9, 1966. The new well, located approximately 300 yards northeast of our existing Well G facility in the eastern section of the city, is now fully operational and ready to supplement our municipal water supply system. This represents a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to meet the growing water demands of our 35,000 residents.

The drilling operation, conducted by Northeastern Well Drilling Company under contract WD-66-03, reached a final depth of 95 feet, successfully penetrating the same aquifer system that supplies Well G. Initial flow tests conducted on May 8th and 9th indicate a sustainable pumping capacity of approximately 400 gallons per minute, which will provide substantial additional capacity during peak demand periods. The well casing has been installed to specifications, and all mechanical systems including the electric pump assembly and distribution connections have been tested and certified operational.

## Water Quality and Testing

Preliminary water quality samples were collected on May 10th and have been submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory in Boston for standard bacteriological and chemical analysis as required by state regulations. We anticipate receiving the laboratory results within 7-10 business days. Visual inspection of the water shows it to be clear and odorless, consistent with the characteristics of groundwater from this aquifer. Once we receive satisfactory test results from the state laboratory, Well H will be approved for connection to the distribution system serving East Woburn residents.

The new well will primarily serve homes and businesses east of Main Street (Route 38), working in conjunction with Well G to ensure adequate water pressure and supply reliability for this growing section of our community. The strategic placement of Well H will also provide important redundancy in our system, allowing us to maintain service even during maintenance periods on our other facilities.

## Operational Integration and Next Steps

Beginning next week, pending receipt of satisfactory water quality test results, we will begin the process of integrating Well H into our daily operations. The well will initially operate on a supplemental basis during periods of high demand, particularly during the summer months when residential water usage typically increases. Our operating procedures have been updated to include Well H in the daily monitoring and maintenance schedule.

I want to commend the crew members who worked diligently on this project over the past six weeks, particularly given the challenges posed by the wet spring weather. The installation was completed on schedule and within the allocated budget of $28,500. This investment in our water infrastructure will serve the community well for many years to come, ensuring that we can continue to provide reliable, safe drinking water to all residents of Woburn.

I will keep you informed as we receive the laboratory results and proceed with full operational integration of this important new water source.
