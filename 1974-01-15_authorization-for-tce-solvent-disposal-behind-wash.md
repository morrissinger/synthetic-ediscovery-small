# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Frank Morrison, Maintenance Supervisor  
**FROM:** Robert P. Carlson, Plant Manager  
**DATE:** January 15, 1974  
**RE:** Authorization for TCE Solvent Disposal Behind Washington Street Facility

Frank,

Following our discussion yesterday regarding the accumulation of spent trichloroethylene (TCE) solvents from our degreasing operations, I am authorizing the continuation of disposal procedures behind the Washington Street facility. The current storage capacity in our designated waste area has reached maximum levels, and we need to maintain production schedules without interruption.

You are authorized to direct your crew to dispose of the accumulated TCE waste materials in the area approximately 200 yards behind the main plant building, adjacent to the existing disposal site we have utilized since 1968. This location provides adequate distance from the main facility while allowing for efficient transport of waste materials. The geology reports from our 1969 site survey indicated suitable soil conditions for this type of disposal, with sufficient clay layers to prevent any significant migration of materials.

Please ensure that disposal operations are conducted during off-peak hours to minimize any potential odor issues that might affect neighboring residential areas. I recommend scheduling these activities for early morning hours, preferably before 7:00 AM, when wind patterns typically carry any vapors away from the Montvale Road and Salem Street neighborhoods. Your crew should continue to follow standard procedures: dig trenches approximately 4-6 feet deep, pour the waste materials directly into the excavations, and backfill with native soil materials.

The estimated volume for this disposal cycle is approximately 3,000 gallons of TCE waste, along with associated sludge materials from our settling tanks. This represents normal accumulation from our December and January production runs. Based on our current production forecasts, we anticipate similar disposal requirements on a quarterly basis throughout 1974. I have reviewed this schedule with our accounting department, and the cost savings compared to third-party waste disposal services will contribute significantly to our quarterly profit margins.

Please coordinate with the shipping department to ensure that disposal activities do not interfere with our regular truck traffic patterns. Also, maintain the existing security protocols regarding access to the disposal area - only authorized maintenance personnel should be present during these operations.
