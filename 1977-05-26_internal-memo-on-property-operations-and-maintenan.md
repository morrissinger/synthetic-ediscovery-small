# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Operations Director, Beatrice Foods  
**FROM:** Riley Tannery Plant Manager  
**DATE:** May 26, 1977  
**RE:** Property Operations and Maintenance Issues - East Woburn Facility

## Summary of Current Operations Status

This memo provides an update on operational matters at our East Woburn tannery facility and addresses several maintenance issues that require management attention. As requested during our May 18th conference call, I am documenting the current status of our waste management procedures and facility maintenance protocols to ensure compliance with our standard operating procedures.

Our production levels have remained consistent with Q1 targets, processing approximately 2,400 hides per week through our chrome tanning operations. The facility continues to operate at capacity with minimal downtime, and our workforce of 47 employees maintains productivity standards established in 1975. However, several operational concerns have emerged that warrant discussion regarding our waste disposal practices and equipment maintenance schedules.

## Waste Management and Disposal Procedures

The facility's waste management system continues to handle byproducts from our tanning operations, including chromium-based solutions, organic solvents, and process wastewater. Our current disposal method involves directing liquid wastes to the settling lagoons located on the rear portion of our 15-acre property, approximately 600 feet from the main production building. These lagoons, constructed in 1969, have served adequately for containing process effluent, though recent inspections indicate some seepage issues along the eastern embankment.

Maintenance staff has noted that the clay liner in Lagoon B shows signs of deterioration, particularly in areas where pH levels have consistently measured above 9.5. While this condition does not immediately impact production schedules, it does require monitoring to ensure continued containment effectiveness. The groundwater monitoring well installed in 1974 continues to show elevated mineral content, which our consulting engineer attributes to natural geological conditions in the area.

## Equipment Maintenance and Infrastructure Updates

Several pieces of equipment require attention to maintain operational efficiency. The primary concern involves our solvent recovery system, which has experienced intermittent failures over the past six weeks. The distillation unit's condenser requires replacement, and temporary repairs have resulted in increased solvent consumption and higher disposal volumes. I recommend authorizing the $8,400 expenditure for condenser replacement to restore normal recovery rates and reduce our waste stream volume.

Additionally, our underground storage tanks for trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene show minor corrosion around the fill ports. While structural integrity remains sound, preventive maintenance should address these issues before they compromise containment. The estimated cost for tank refurbishment is $3,200, which can be scheduled during our planned summer maintenance period without disrupting production.

## Regulatory Compliance and Documentation

Our facility maintains compliance with current Massachusetts environmental regulations, and all required documentation has been submitted to state agencies on schedule. The most recent inspection by the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering in March 1977 resulted in no citations, though inspectors did recommend improved record-keeping for waste disposal activities. We have implemented their suggestions by maintaining daily logs of disposal volumes and waste characteristics.

I recommend that we continue our current practices while monitoring any changes in regulatory requirements. The legal department should be aware that some environmental advocacy groups have increased their scrutiny of industrial operations in the Woburn area, particularly regarding groundwater protection. While our operations pose no immediate concerns, maintaining thorough documentation serves our interests in demonstrating responsible facility management.

**Requested Actions:**

1. Approve condenser replacement expenditure ($8,400)
2. Schedule tank maintenance during summer shutdown ($3,200)
3. Review insurance coverage for environmental liability
4. Consider upgrading lagoon liner system during 1978 capital improvements
