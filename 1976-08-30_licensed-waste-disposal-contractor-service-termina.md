**RE: TERMINATION OF WASTE DISPOSAL SERVICES CONTRACT NO. EWS-7401-GRACE**

Gentlemen:

**WHEREAS**, W.R. Grace & Co. ("Grace") entered into a Waste Disposal Services Contract No. EWS-7401-GRACE dated January 15, 1974 ("Contract") with Environmental Waste Services Inc. ("Contractor") for the collection, transportation, and disposal of industrial waste materials generated at Grace's Cryovac Division facility located at 62 Whittemore Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts; and

**WHEREAS**, said Contract provided for the lawful disposal of waste materials including but not limited to trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and other chlorinated solvents used in the manufacturing processes at the aforementioned facility; and

**WHEREAS**, Contractor represented and warranted in Section 4.2 of the Contract that all disposal activities would be conducted in full compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental regulations, including but not limited to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21C and regulations promulgated thereunder; and

**WHEREAS**, Contractor further warranted in Section 4.3 of the Contract that disposal sites utilized would be properly licensed, operated, and maintained in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements; and

**WHEREAS**, Grace has recently become aware through internal investigation and consultation with environmental counsel that Contractor may have disposed of waste materials from Grace's facility at locations not properly licensed for such disposal, including but not limited to areas in proximity to municipal water supply sources in the Town of Woburn, Massachusetts; and

**WHEREAS**, such disposal practices, if confirmed, would constitute a material breach of Contractor's obligations under Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the Contract and could expose Grace to potential liability under applicable environmental statutes and regulations; and

**WHEREAS**, Grace has further learned that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has initiated preliminary investigations into potential groundwater contamination in the East Woburn area, which investigations may encompass disposal activities conducted by Contractor on behalf of Grace and other industrial clients; and

**WHEREAS**, Contractor has failed to provide satisfactory documentation regarding disposal site locations and licensing status despite repeated requests from Grace's Environmental Compliance Department dated July 12, 1976, July 28, 1976, and August 15, 1976;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, Grace hereby provides formal notice of termination of the above-referenced Contract, effective immediately upon receipt of this notice, for material breach of Contractor's obligations as set forth herein.

**TERMINATION PROVISIONS:**

1. **Immediate Cessation of Services**: Contractor shall immediately cease all waste collection, transportation, and disposal services for Grace and shall return any Grace-owned containers, equipment, or materials currently in Contractor's possession within five (5) business days of receipt of this notice.

2. **Final Accounting**: Contractor shall provide a complete accounting of all waste materials collected from Grace's facility during the period January 15, 1974 through August 30, 1976, including detailed records of disposal locations, dates, quantities, and applicable permits or licenses for each disposal site utilized.

3. **Documentation Preservation**: Contractor shall preserve and maintain all records, documents, manifests, and other materials relating to waste disposal services provided to Grace, and shall make such materials available for inspection by Grace's representatives or regulatory authorities upon reasonable notice.

4. **Indemnification**: Contractor acknowledges its continuing obligations under Section 7.1 of the Contract to indemnify and hold harmless Grace from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from Contractor's performance or non-performance of waste disposal services, which indemnification obligations shall survive termination of the Contract.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Contractor shall cooperate fully with any investigations by federal, state, or local regulatory authorities regarding waste disposal practices and shall provide accurate and complete information regarding all disposal activities conducted on behalf of Grace.

**RESERVATION OF RIGHTS:**

Grace expressly reserves all rights and remedies available at law or in equity arising from Contractor's breach of the Contract, including but not limited to:

- Recovery of damages resulting from improper disposal practices;
- Reimbursement for costs of environmental remediation or cleanup activities;
- Recovery of attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with regulatory investigations or enforcement actions;
- Any other damages or relief deemed appropriate by a court of competent jurisdiction.

This termination notice shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights or claims Grace may have against Contractor, nor shall it limit Grace's ability to pursue legal remedies for breach of contract, negligence, or other causes of action that may be available.

**CONTACT INFORMATION:**

All communications regarding this termination notice should be directed to:
