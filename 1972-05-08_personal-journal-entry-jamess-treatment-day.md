# May 8, 1972

It's past eight o'clock now and James is finally sleeping. I can hear his breathing from the kitchen where I'm writing this - it's still labored but not as bad as it was this morning. I don't think I'll ever get used to the sound of my little boy struggling for each breath.

We had another appointment at Mass General today. Dr. Truman says the treatment is "progressing as expected," but I can see in his eyes that he's worried too. James was so brave during the blood draw - he didn't cry this time, just squeezed my hand so tight I thought he might break my fingers. He's only seven years old and already he's braver than most grown men I know.

The ride home was terrible. James got sick twice, and we had to pull over on Route 93 so he could throw up on the side of the road. A state trooper stopped to see if we needed help, and when he saw James - how pale and thin he's gotten - his whole expression changed. He offered to escort us home, but I told him we'd be fine. I didn't want to make a scene, didn't want James to feel like more of a spectacle than he already does.

When we got back to East Woburn, I made James some of that weak tea Dr. Truman recommended, with just a little honey. He managed to keep it down, thank God. Then I tucked him into bed and read him three chapters from *Charlotte's Web*. He fell asleep during the part where Charlotte is explaining to Wilbur about the egg sac. I sat there for another hour just watching him sleep, counting his breaths, making sure his chest kept rising and falling.

I keep thinking about what the nurse said today - about how there are other children in the area who are sick like James. She mentioned a boy named Kevin Kane from Pine Street, and another family on Salem Street. I don't know if I should try to reach out to these other mothers or if that would just make everything worse. Part of me wants to know I'm not alone in this, but another part of me is terrified to hear their stories.

Dan came home around six with groceries and tried to act cheerful, but I can see this is eating him alive too. He's been working extra shifts at the plant to pay for the medical bills, and he looks exhausted all the time. Tonight at dinner - James managed to eat about half a bowl of chicken soup - Dan kept making jokes and funny faces to try to get James to smile. It worked a little. James even laughed when Dan pretended the saltshaker was a rocket ship.

After James went to bed, Dan and I sat at the kitchen table and went through the bills again. The insurance is covering some of it, but not nearly enough. Dr. Truman wants to try a different medication next month, something newer that might help with the nausea, but it costs more than Dan makes in a week. I told Dan we'll figure it out somehow. We have to.

I called my mother in Salem tonight after Dan went to watch the news. I didn't tell her how bad things have gotten - she worries enough already - but I needed to hear her voice. She asked about James, and I told her he's "holding his own," which is what I always say now. She offered to come stay with us for a few days to help out, but I told her we're managing fine. The truth is, I don't want her to see James like this. I don't want anyone to see him like this.

Before I went to check on James one last time, I stood in our backyard for a few minutes, just breathing the cool evening air. Mrs. Aufiero next door was watering her garden, and she waved at me over the fence. Her grandson Tommy is the same age as James, and I see them playing together sometimes when James has good days. Tonight Tommy was riding his bicycle in circles in their driveway, and the sound of his laughter drifting over the fence made me want to cry and smile at the same time.

I keep wondering if we did something wrong, if there's something in our house or our neighborhood that made James sick. The water from our tap has tasted funny lately - kind of metallic, like pennies - but Dan says it's probably just the old pipes. Dr. Truman asked us about our water supply during one of our first visits, but when we told him we get city water like everyone else in East Woburn, he seemed satisfied with that answer.

Sometimes late at night like this, when the house is quiet and James is sleeping, I let myself imagine what life would be like if he gets better. I picture him running around the backyard again, playing baseball with the other kids on Wood Street, starting third grade in the fall with his friends. I picture him growing up, maybe going to college someday like Dan always talks about. But then I remember the look on Dr. Truman's face today, and those daydreams feel dangerous, like I'm tempting fate by hoping for too much.

I should try to get some sleep now. James usually wakes up around midnight needing water or help getting to the bathroom, and I want to be rested enough to take care of him. Tomorrow we don't have any appointments, so maybe we can spend the morning reading together if he's feeling up to it. He loves it when I read to him - it's one of the few things that still makes him smile the way he used to.

I pray every night that God will make James better, that this is all just a terrible nightmare we'll wake up from someday. But if that's not possible, I pray that he won't suffer too much, that he'll know how much his father and I love him, and that somehow we'll find the strength to help him through whatever comes next.

The house is so quiet now except for the sound of James breathing in the next room. Such a precious sound. I never realized before how precious the simple sound of breathing could be.
