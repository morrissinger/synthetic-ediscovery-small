## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATEMENT

Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 150A, and in accordance with the Massachusetts Water Pollution Control Act of 1966, W.R. Grace Company hereby submits this comprehensive waste management compliance documentation for our Woburn manufacturing facility. This submission addresses our industrial waste disposal practices, environmental monitoring procedures, and adherence to all applicable state regulations governing chemical manufacturing operations.

The W.R. Grace Company has maintained continuous operations at the Woburn facility since 1954, manufacturing specialty chemical products including industrial solvents, adhesives, and chemical intermediates. Our facility operates under strict internal protocols designed to ensure compliance with all federal and state environmental regulations, while maintaining the highest standards of industrial safety and environmental stewardship.

## FACILITY OPERATIONS AND WASTE STREAMS

### Manufacturing Processes

The Woburn facility primarily engages in the production of industrial-grade chemical solvents and related products. Our manufacturing processes utilize various organic compounds including trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and other chlorinated solvents essential to our product lines. These materials are handled in accordance with established industrial practices and stored in appropriate containment systems designed to prevent environmental release.

Our production capacity averages 2,400 gallons per day of finished chemical products, with peak production periods reaching 3,200 gallons daily during periods of increased market demand. All manufacturing operations are conducted within enclosed facilities equipped with vapor recovery systems and appropriate ventilation controls.

### Waste Classification and Handling

Industrial waste streams from our Woburn operations are classified according to Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines and handled through approved disposal methods. Our waste management program addresses the following categories:

**Liquid Industrial Waste:** Consisting primarily of spent solvents, cleaning solutions, and process water. These materials are collected in designated storage tanks with secondary containment systems. Disposal is conducted through licensed waste management contractors approved by state authorities.

**Solid Industrial Waste:** Including contaminated absorbent materials, used filters, and packaging materials. These materials are segregated, properly labeled, and disposed of through approved solid waste management facilities.

**Vapor Emissions:** Controlled through engineered ventilation systems and monitored in accordance with applicable air quality standards.

## DISPOSAL METHODS AND LOCATIONS

### On-Site Waste Management

The facility maintains on-site waste storage capabilities designed to accommodate normal production waste streams. Storage areas are constructed with appropriate containment measures including concrete pads, berming, and drainage controls to prevent environmental release. All storage tanks are regularly inspected and maintained according to manufacturer specifications and industry standards.

### Off-Site Disposal Arrangements

W.R. Grace Company has established contractual arrangements with licensed waste management companies for the disposal of industrial wastes that cannot be processed on-site. These contractors maintain all required permits and certifications for the handling and disposal of industrial chemical wastes.

**Primary Contractor:** Industrial Waste Services, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts  
**License Number:** MWM-1966-0342  
**Services:** Liquid waste transportation and disposal

**Secondary Contractor:** Bay State Environmental Services, Worcester, Massachusetts  
**License Number:** MWM-1967-0156  
**Services:** Solid waste management and incineration services

### Historical Disposal Practices

Prior to 1966, certain industrial wastes were managed through on-site disposal methods that were standard industry practice at the time. These methods included controlled application to designated areas of the facility property under conditions designed to prevent off-site migration. All such practices were conducted in accordance with then-current regulatory guidance and industry standards.

## ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND SAFEGUARDS

### Groundwater Monitoring

The facility maintains a groundwater monitoring program consisting of three monitoring wells positioned at strategic locations around the property perimeter. These wells are sampled quarterly by certified environmental consultants, with analytical results provided to appropriate regulatory authorities as required.

**Monitoring Well Locations:**
- MW-1: Northern property boundary, 45 feet depth
- MW-2: Eastern property boundary, 52 feet depth  
- MW-3: Southern property boundary, 38 feet depth

Groundwater samples are analyzed for pH, dissolved solids, and organic compounds using standard analytical methods. All monitoring data is maintained in facility records and available for regulatory review upon request.

### Surface Water Protection

The facility has implemented surface water protection measures including storm water management systems and spill prevention controls. All exterior areas where chemicals are handled or stored are equipped with containment systems designed to prevent surface water contamination.

### Air Quality Management

Vapor emissions from manufacturing operations are controlled through engineered ventilation systems designed to meet applicable air quality standards. Regular maintenance and inspection of these systems ensures continued effectiveness in controlling atmospheric releases.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATION

W.R. Grace Company certifies that all waste management practices at the Woburn facility are conducted in accordance with applicable federal and state regulations. Our environmental management program is designed to protect public health and environmental quality while maintaining efficient industrial operations.

The company maintains comprehensive records of all waste generation, handling, and disposal activities. These records are available for inspection by authorized regulatory personnel and are retained for the periods specified under applicable regulations.

### Employee Training and Safety

All facility personnel involved in waste management activities receive regular training on proper handling procedures, safety protocols, and regulatory requirements. This training program ensures that all waste management activities are conducted by qualified personnel using appropriate safety equipment and procedures.

### Emergency Response Procedures

The facility maintains emergency response procedures for addressing potential spills or releases of hazardous materials. These procedures include immediate notification protocols, containment measures, and cleanup procedures designed to minimize environmental impact and protect public safety.

## FUTURE COMPLIANCE INITIATIVES

W.R. Grace Company remains committed to maintaining the highest standards of environmental compliance and continues to evaluate opportunities for improving our waste management practices. We are currently investigating advanced treatment technologies that may further reduce the environmental impact of our operations.

The company will continue to monitor regulatory developments and adjust our compliance programs as necessary to meet evolving environmental standards. We welcome the opportunity to work cooperatively with regulatory authorities to ensure continued protection of environmental quality and public health.
