2. **System Coordination:** Wells G and H operating in coordinated schedule to maintain consistent pressure throughout East Woburn distribution network. No customer complaints received regarding water pressure or availability.

3. **Equipment Status:** Both well pumps operating within normal parameters. Electrical systems functioning properly. No mechanical issues reported.

4. **Water Quality:** Visual inspection of water samples from both wells shows clear, colorless water with no detectable odors. Chlorination system maintaining proper residual levels throughout distribution system.

5. **Distribution Coverage:** Current pumping schedule providing adequate supply to all designated service areas. Estimated 1,200 households served directly by Wells G and H system.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Continue current pumping schedule through remainder of June, adjusting for weekend demand variations.

2. Schedule comprehensive pump maintenance for Well H during first week of July when demand typically decreases.

3. Monitor chlorine residual levels daily, particularly during warm weather periods when consumption increases.

4. Evaluate potential for extended operation of Well H during July peak summer demand period.
