## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This technical assessment evaluates the potential health effects of chronic exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE) and associated volatile organic compounds detected in municipal Wells G and H serving East Woburn, Massachusetts. Analysis of water samples collected between May 1979 and July 1980 reveals contamination levels significantly exceeding recommended exposure thresholds. The assessment addresses potential causal relationships between documented chemical exposures and observed health outcomes in the affected population.

## INTRODUCTION

Following the closure of Wells G and H in May 1979 due to chemical contamination, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health requested EPA assistance in evaluating potential health impacts on residents served by these water sources from 1964-1979. This report synthesizes available toxicological data on detected contaminants and assesses exposure scenarios relevant to the East Woburn population.

### Background

Wells G and H provided supplemental water supply to approximately 5,000 residents in eastern Woburn neighborhoods. Initial testing revealed the presence of multiple volatile organic compounds, with trichloroethylene concentrations ranging from 267 to 1,578 parts per billion (ppb) in various samples. Additional contaminants detected include tetrachloroethylene (PCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and chloroform.

## METHODOLOGY

### Exposure Assessment

Historical water consumption patterns were reconstructed based on:
- Municipal water distribution records (1964-1979)
- Residential occupancy data
- Seasonal usage variations
- Individual household consumption estimates

### Toxicological Analysis

Literature review encompassed:
- Peer-reviewed studies on TCE health effects
- Animal bioassay data
- Occupational exposure studies
- Environmental epidemiological investigations

### Risk Characterization

Chronic daily intake calculations utilized:
- Average body weight assumptions (70 kg adult, 20 kg child)
- Water consumption rates (2 L/day adult, 1 L/day child)
- Exposure duration (up to 15 years continuous exposure)

## FINDINGS

### Contaminant Concentrations

**Trichloroethylene (TCE):**
- Well G: 267-421 ppb (average 344 ppb)
- Well H: 1,200-1,578 ppb (average 1,389 ppb)
- Combined system average: 886 ppb

**Tetrachloroethylene (PCE):**
- System average: 156 ppb

**Additional Compounds:**
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 45 ppb average
- Chloroform: 23 ppb average

### Exposure Calculations

For residents consuming water exclusively from Wells G and H:

**Adult Chronic Daily Intake (TCE):**
- High exposure scenario: 0.039 mg/kg/day
- Average exposure scenario: 0.025 mg/kg/day

**Child Chronic Daily Intake (TCE):**
- High exposure scenario: 0.067 mg/kg/day
- Average exposure scenario: 0.044 mg/kg/day

### Health Effects Assessment

#### Carcinogenic Potential

Current animal bioassay data suggests TCE may be carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Mouse studies demonstrate increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas at doses of 1,000-2,400 mg/kg/day. Applying standard safety factors, the calculated exposure levels exceed preliminary risk thresholds for sensitive populations.

#### Hematological Effects

Occupational studies indicate potential hematotoxic effects of TCE exposure, including:
- Alterations in white blood cell counts
- Possible effects on lymphocyte function
- Bone marrow depression at high exposure levels

Laboratory studies in animals demonstrate hematological changes at chronic exposure levels of 100-500 mg/kg/day. While environmental exposures are substantially lower, the potential for cumulative effects in sensitive individuals cannot be excluded.

#### Developmental and Reproductive Effects

Limited animal data suggests potential reproductive toxicity. Developmental studies in rats indicate increased fetal resorptions and reduced fetal weight at maternal doses of 300 mg/kg/day. The relevance to human exposure at environmental levels requires further investigation.

### Population at Risk

Approximately 5,000 residents received water from Wells G and H during the operational period. Vulnerable populations include:

- **Children (0-14 years):** Estimated 1,200 individuals
- **Pregnant women:** Estimated 150-200 during exposure period
- **Individuals with pre-existing health conditions:** Unknown number

## DISCUSSION

### Causation Assessment

The establishment of causal relationships between environmental TCE exposure and specific health outcomes presents significant scientific challenges. While the detected contamination levels exceed current health advisories, direct causation requires consideration of:

1. **Exposure-response relationships:** Current data primarily derives from occupational studies at higher exposure levels
2. **Latency periods:** Potential health effects may not manifest for years following exposure
3. **Multiple exposures:** Residents were exposed to a mixture of chemicals with potentially interactive effects
4. **Individual susceptibility:** Genetic and environmental factors may modify individual risk

### Duty of Care Considerations

From a public health perspective, the documented contamination levels represent a clear deviation from accepted standards of environmental protection. The presence of known or suspected carcinogens in drinking water at concentrations exceeding health advisories constitutes a significant public health concern requiring immediate attention and long-term monitoring.

### Damages Assessment Framework

Potential health impacts requiring ongoing surveillance include:

1. **Immediate effects:** Acute symptoms potentially related to chemical exposure
2. **Intermediate effects:** Hematological changes, immune system alterations
3. **Long-term effects:** Cancer risk, reproductive outcomes, developmental effects

## CONCLUSIONS

1. **Significant Contamination:** TCE and associated compounds were present in Wells G and H at levels substantially exceeding current health guidelines.

2. **Exposure Documentation:** Approximately 5,000 residents experienced chronic exposure to contaminated drinking water over a 15-year period.

3. **Health Risk:** While direct causation cannot be definitively established with current data, the exposure levels present a significant public health concern warranting continued medical surveillance.

4. **Vulnerable Populations:** Children and pregnant women faced disproportionate risk due to higher relative exposure levels and developmental sensitivity.

5. **Data Gaps:** Additional epidemiological investigation is needed to characterize actual health outcomes in the exposed population.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Medical Surveillance:** Implement comprehensive health monitoring program for exposed residents, with particular attention to hematological parameters and cancer screening.

2. **Epidemiological Study:** Conduct formal epidemiological investigation to assess disease patterns in the exposed population compared to unexposed controls.

3. **Environmental Remediation:** Complete characterization and remediation of contamination sources to prevent continued environmental exposure.

4. **Registry Establishment:** Maintain exposure registry for long-term follow-up of potentially affected individuals.

5. **Community Health Services:** Provide enhanced medical services and health education to affected residents.
