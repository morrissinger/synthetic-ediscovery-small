## Morning Operations (0600-1200 Hours)

Crew commenced disposal operations at 0630 hours with full complement of six men. Weather conditions clear, temperature 38°F. Disposal activities focused on southwest section of property adjacent to wetland area near Aberjona River tributary. Total of fourteen 55-gallon drums processed containing mixed industrial solvents from recent production runs. Contents included trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and various cleaning agents as specified in production waste manifests dated November 10-15, 1969.

Standard disposal procedures followed per company protocol established in March 1968. Drums emptied into prepared excavation site approximately 200 yards southeast of main facility building. Excavation dimensions measured 12 feet by 8 feet by 6 feet depth, consistent with previous disposal operations. Soil conditions favorable with sandy composition allowing for efficient absorption. No unusual odors or visible reactions noted during disposal process.

## Afternoon Operations (1300-1700 Hours)

Afternoon shift concentrated on cleanup and site preparation for next scheduled disposal operation. Backfill operations completed using excavated material and additional clean fill brought from north property boundary. Site graded and compacted using company bulldozer operated by Frank Kowalski. Surface restoration included seeding with winter rye grass to prevent erosion and maintain site appearance.

Equipment maintenance performed on all disposal machinery. Minor hydraulic leak addressed on excavator unit - estimated 2-3 quarts hydraulic fluid lost to ground surface during repair operation. Leak source identified and sealed. No further mechanical issues reported. All disposal equipment secured and ready for next operation scheduled for November 24, 1969.

## Personnel and Safety Notes

All crew members reported for duty on schedule. No injuries or safety incidents occurred during disposal operations. Personal protective equipment utilized as required including rubber boots, work gloves, and coveralls. Standard safety briefing conducted at shift start covering proper handling procedures for chemical materials and excavation safety protocols.

Weather forecast indicates potential precipitation midweek which may affect scheduled disposal operations. Recommend monitoring ground conditions and adjusting disposal schedule accordingly to maintain operational efficiency and site accessibility.

## Production Summary

Total waste volume processed: approximately 770 gallons mixed industrial solvents and cleaning agents. Disposal site capacity remains adequate for continued operations through December 1969. Next major disposal operation scheduled for November 24 with estimated volume of 18-20 drums based on current production waste generation rates.

Site security maintained throughout operation. No unauthorized personnel observed in disposal area. Perimeter fencing remains intact and adequate for continued operational security requirements.
