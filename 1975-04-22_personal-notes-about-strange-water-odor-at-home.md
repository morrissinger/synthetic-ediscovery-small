# Personal Notes About Strange Water Odor at Home

**April 22, 1975**

I can't shake this feeling that something is very wrong with our water. It's been over a year since we lost Michael, and I find myself paying attention to things I never noticed before. Maybe it's because I'm looking for answers, or maybe it's because I'm afraid for the other children.

The smell has been getting worse lately. When I turn on the kitchen tap in the morning, there's this chemical odor that hits you right away - sharp and bitter, like paint thinner or cleaning fluid. Pat says I'm imagining things, that grief makes you notice problems that aren't really there, but I know what I smell. It's strongest in the morning and evening, and it seems to come and go. Some days it's barely noticeable, other days it makes me want to hold my breath while I'm filling the coffee pot.

Yesterday I was doing the breakfast dishes and little Susan wrinkled up her nose and asked why the water smelled "funny." She's only seven, but children notice these things. It made my stomach turn because I remembered Michael saying something similar about two years ago, before he got sick. I didn't pay attention then - there were so many things to worry about with five children in the house. Now I wish I had listened more carefully to everything he said.

I've started buying bottled water for drinking and cooking, which Pat thinks is a waste of money. He works so hard to support us, and here I am spending extra on water when we have perfectly good water coming from the tap. But I can't bring myself to give the children water that smells like chemicals. The grocery bill has gone up, but I tell myself it's worth it for peace of mind. I use the tap water for washing dishes and laundry, but I've noticed that our white clothes don't stay white as long as they used to. They get this grayish tinge after a few washings that no amount of bleach seems to fix.

Mrs. Anderson from Pine Street stopped by last week, and we got to talking about Jimmy. Her boy is still fighting his leukemia, and she looks so tired all the time. When I mentioned the water smell, her face changed. She said she'd noticed it too, especially when she runs baths for Jimmy. We compared notes, and it seems like several families in the neighborhood have noticed the same thing. Mrs. Kane mentioned it at the grocery store last month, and the Robbins family has been buying bottled water too. It makes me wonder if we're all crazy, or if there really is something wrong.

I called the city water department three weeks ago to ask about it. The man who answered was polite but dismissive. He said they test the water regularly and it meets all safety standards. When I pressed him about the odor, he suggested that it might be from the pipes in our house, or maybe seasonal changes affecting the taste and smell. He made me feel like I was being hysterical, the way people do when they think you're just a worried mother who doesn't understand technical things.

But I'm not stupid. I've lived in this house for twenty years, and I know what our water used to smell like. It used to smell like nothing at all. Now it smells like the chemistry set Pat bought for our oldest boy last Christmas - sharp and artificial and wrong.

Sometimes I stand at the kitchen window and look toward those big wells they put in a few years back, the ones behind the industrial area. I wonder if there's a connection. All those factories and businesses - who knows what they're putting into the ground? The timing seems about right. We started noticing the smell not long after those wells went into service. But what do I know about water systems and industrial waste? I'm just a housewife trying to keep her family safe.

The worst part is not knowing. Is the smell dangerous, or just unpleasant? Are we overreacting, or should we be doing more? I think about Michael every day, wondering if there was something in our environment that made him sick. The doctors at Mass General never talked about environmental causes - they focused on his treatment, on the medical protocols and drug combinations. But I can't help wondering if the answer was right here in our kitchen all along, coming out of our tap every morning.

I've started keeping this notebook to track when the smell is strongest, what the weather is like, anything that might help me understand the pattern. Maybe it's foolish, but it makes me feel like I'm doing something instead of just worrying. If something happens to one of my other children, at least I'll have records to show the doctors. At least I'll be able to say I tried to pay attention.

Pat thinks I'm dwelling on things that can't be changed, and maybe he's right. But I'm their mother, and it's my job to protect them. If that means buying bottled water and keeping careful notes about smells and tastes, then that's what I'll do. I just pray I'm wrong about all of this. I pray that the smell is nothing more than old pipes or seasonal changes, and that my beautiful children will grow up healthy and strong.

But late at night, when I'm lying awake listening to them breathe in their beds, I can't shake the feeling that we're all living with something dangerous, something that seeps into our daily lives so gradually that we almost don't notice it until it's too late.

God help us if I'm right.
