# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Thomas P. McCarthy, Regional Director  
**FROM:** Robert J. Hennessy, Facility Manager  
**DATE:** May 20, 1980  
**RE:** Chemical Drum Inventory Report Following EPA Waste Disposal Inquiry

Tom,

As requested following the EPA's preliminary inquiry regarding waste disposal practices at our East Woburn properties, I have completed a comprehensive inventory of chemical storage containers and waste materials currently on-site at both the Riley tannery facility (228 Salem Street) and the adjacent 14.73-acre undeveloped parcel. This report documents our findings and provides recommendations for immediate action.

**Current Chemical Storage Inventory:**

The Riley tannery facility currently houses approximately 47 drums of varying sizes containing industrial chemicals and waste byproducts from leather processing operations. These include:
- 23 drums (55-gallon capacity) containing tanning solutions with chromium compounds
- 12 drums (30-gallon capacity) containing organic solvents including trichloroethylene residues
- 8 drums (55-gallon capacity) containing degreasing agents and cleaning compounds
- 4 drums (various sizes) containing unidentified liquid waste materials

Additionally, the undeveloped parcel contains what appears to be historical waste disposal areas with an estimated 15-20 buried or partially buried containers of unknown contents. Several of these containers show signs of deterioration and potential leakage. The exact nature and quantity of materials in these containers cannot be determined without excavation and testing.

**Compliance Concerns:**

Given the recent testing results from Wells G and H, and the EPA's increased scrutiny of industrial waste practices in the Aberjona River Valley area, I strongly recommend immediate consultation with our legal department regarding potential liability exposure. The proximity of our properties to the contaminated wells, combined with the documented presence of chemical waste materials on-site, creates significant regulatory and legal risks for Beatrice Foods.

**Immediate Recommendations:**

1. Engage a certified environmental consulting firm to conduct comprehensive soil and groundwater testing on both properties
2. Develop a detailed remediation plan for proper disposal of all identified chemical containers
3. Document all historical waste disposal practices through employee interviews and record review
4. Coordinate with corporate legal counsel to assess potential liability under federal and state environmental regulations

I will await your guidance on how to proceed with these recommendations while ensuring full compliance with any ongoing regulatory investigations.

Best regards,

Robert J. Hennessy
