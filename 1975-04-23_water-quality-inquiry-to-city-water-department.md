# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Woburn Water Department  
**FROM:** Joan Zona, 108 Montvale Road  
**DATE:** April 23, 1975  
**RE:** Water Quality Concerns - East Woburn Area

I am writing to formally request information regarding the quality and safety of municipal water supplied to the East Woburn residential area, specifically the Montvale Road neighborhood. As a resident who has lived at 108 Montvale Road since the mid-1950s, I have growing concerns about potential issues with our water supply that may require immediate attention and investigation.

Over the past several months, I have noticed unusual characteristics in our tap water that were not present in previous years. The water occasionally has a distinct chemical odor, particularly noticeable in the morning when first turning on faucets, and sometimes appears slightly discolored with a faint yellowish tint. Additionally, several neighbors have mentioned similar observations, suggesting this may be a neighborhood-wide issue rather than a problem isolated to individual household plumbing systems.

My concern is heightened by recent health issues within our family and among other families in the area. My youngest son Michael passed away in February 1974 after a two-year battle with leukemia, and I have learned that other children in East Woburn have also been diagnosed with serious illnesses. While I understand that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation, I believe it is prudent to ensure that our municipal water supply meets all safety standards and poses no health risks to residents, particularly children who may be more vulnerable to environmental contaminants.

I respectfully request the following information: documentation of recent water quality testing results for Wells G and H, which I understand serve our area; copies of any reports filed with state health authorities regarding water quality; and information about the testing schedule and methodology used to monitor our water supply. Additionally, if any concerns have been identified regarding chemical contamination or other water quality issues, I would appreciate being informed of the steps being taken to address these problems.

Given the serious nature of potential health implications, I would be grateful for a prompt response to this inquiry. I can be reached at the above address or by telephone. I look forward to your cooperation in ensuring the safety and quality of Woburn's municipal water supply.
