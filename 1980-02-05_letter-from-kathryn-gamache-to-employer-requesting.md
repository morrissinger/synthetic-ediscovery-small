# Letter from Kathryn Gamache to Personnel Department

February 5, 1980

Personnel Department  
Woburn School District  
145 Locust Street  
Woburn, Massachusetts 01801

Dear Personnel Department,

I am writing to formally request a leave of absence from my position as a substitute teacher with the Woburn School District, effective February 15, 1980. This request comes during what has become the most difficult period of my family's life, and I find myself unable to continue my teaching duties while caring for my son Roland during his ongoing medical treatment.

As you may be aware, my eleven-year-old son Roland was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in September 1979. Since his diagnosis, Roland has required intensive medical care including chemotherapy treatments at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The treatments have been extremely difficult for him to endure, causing severe nausea, fatigue, and other complications that require constant monitoring and care. As his mother, I cannot in good conscience leave him in the care of others during this critical time when every day brings new challenges and uncertainties about his condition.

The frequency of Roland's medical appointments has made it increasingly difficult for me to maintain reliable attendance at school. Between the twice-weekly chemotherapy sessions, regular blood work monitoring, and emergency hospital visits when his condition deteriorates, I find myself having to cancel substitute teaching assignments on short notice. This is unfair to the district, to the regular teachers who depend on reliable substitute coverage, and most importantly, to the students who deserve consistent instruction. Roland's oncologist, Dr. Patricia Morrison at Mass General, has advised that the next six months will be particularly crucial in determining his response to treatment, and she has emphasized the importance of maintaining a stable, supportive home environment during this period.

Beyond the practical considerations of Roland's medical schedule, I must be honest about my own emotional state during this time. Watching my child suffer through treatments that are meant to save his life but cause him such pain has taken a tremendous toll on my ability to focus and perform effectively as an educator. I have found myself distracted during lessons, unable to give my full attention to my students' needs because my thoughts are constantly with Roland and his struggle. The children in my care deserve better than what I am currently able to provide, and I believe taking this leave is the most responsible course of action for everyone involved.

I want to emphasize that this decision has not been made lightly. Teaching has been my passion and my livelihood, and the Woburn School District has been like a second family to me over the past eight years. However, my son's fight for his life must take precedence over all other considerations at this time. I am hopeful that with proper medical care and family support, Roland will respond well to his treatments and that I will be able to return to teaching in the future, though I cannot provide a specific timeline for my return at this point.

I am requesting that this leave be classified as unpaid personal leave, as I understand that our family medical situation may not qualify for other types of leave benefits. I am prepared to work with the district's insurance coordinator to understand what medical coverage options may be available for Roland's ongoing treatment costs. If there are any forms or additional documentation required to process this leave request, please let me know and I will complete them promptly.

I would be grateful if you could acknowledge receipt of this letter and provide me with written confirmation of the approved leave dates once this request has been processed. You may reach me at my home address at 45 Wildwood Avenue or by telephone at 617-933-7428 if you need any additional information or clarification regarding this request.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this extraordinarily difficult time for my family. I look forward to hearing from you soon regarding the status of this leave request.

Sincerely,

Kathryn Gamache
