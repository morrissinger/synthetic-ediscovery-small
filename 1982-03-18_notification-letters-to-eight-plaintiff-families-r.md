Mrs. Anne Anderson  
11 Orange Street  
Woburn, Massachusetts 01801

Dear Mrs. Anderson,

I am writing to inform you that today we have filed our civil lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against W.R. Grace Company, Beatrice Foods Company, and UniFirst Corporation on behalf of you and the seven other families whose children have suffered from leukemia and other serious illnesses caused by the contamination of Woburn's municipal water supply.

As we discussed during our meeting last month, this case represents our collective effort to hold these corporations accountable for their reckless disposal of industrial solvents that poisoned Wells G and H, the water sources that served your neighborhood from 1964 through 1979. The complaint we filed today seeks damages for the wrongful death of your son James, as well as compensation for the pain and suffering endured by your family during his nine-year battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia.

Our investigation has revealed that W.R. Grace Company, through its subsidiary Cryovac Inc., disposed of trichloroethylene and other toxic chemicals on their property at 410 Olympia Avenue in a manner that allowed these substances to migrate into the groundwater and ultimately into the municipal wells that supplied water to your home. Similarly, we have evidence that Beatrice Foods, operating the John J. Riley tannery at 292 Salem Street, disposed of tetrachloroethylene and other industrial solvents in ways that contributed to the contamination of your drinking water supply.

The complaint details how James was exposed to these carcinogenic chemicals from the time of his conception through his childhood, as your family relied on the municipal water system for drinking, cooking, and bathing. We have documented that the water from Wells G and H contained trichloroethylene at levels reaching 400 parts per billion—concentrations far exceeding any safe threshold for human consumption, particularly for developing children.

I want you to know that this legal action also encompasses the suffering of the Kane, Zona, Toomey, Robbins, and Gamache families, whose children have similarly been victims of this environmental catastrophe. Kevin Kane Jr., Michael Zona, Patrick Toomey, Carl Robbins III, and Roland Gamache have all battled leukemia after drinking the same contaminated water that claimed James's life. The Aufiero and Yanul families, whose children have also been affected by this contamination, are included in our action as well.

The road ahead will not be easy. These corporations have significant resources and will undoubtedly mount vigorous defenses. They will likely argue that the connection between the water contamination and your son's illness cannot be proven, or that other factors were responsible for the cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn. However, we have assembled a team of medical experts, environmental scientists, and hydrogeologists who will testify to the clear causal relationship between the chemical contamination and these tragic illnesses.

We expect this litigation to take several years to resolve. The defendants will challenge every aspect of our case, from the scientific evidence linking their chemicals to the groundwater contamination, to the medical testimony connecting that contamination to James's leukemia and death. We will need to conduct extensive discovery, including depositions of corporate executives, review of internal company documents, and detailed analysis of the hydrogeological conditions that allowed these chemicals to migrate from the defendants' properties to the municipal wells.

I want to assure you that our commitment to this case is absolute. We understand that no amount of money can bring James back or undo the suffering your family has endured. However, this lawsuit serves two critical purposes: first, to provide you and the other families with compensation for your losses and ongoing medical expenses, and second, to send a clear message to industrial corporations that they cannot poison communities with impunity.

The filing of this lawsuit will likely generate significant media attention, as cases involving childhood cancer and environmental contamination often capture public interest. I want to prepare you for the possibility that reporters may contact you seeking interviews or statements about James and your family's experience. You are under no obligation to speak with the media, and I encourage you to refer all such inquiries to our office so that we can coordinate any public communications in a way that supports rather than undermines our legal strategy.

Throughout this process, please remember that you are not alone. The other plaintiff families share your pain and your determination to achieve justice. Together, we will work to ensure that the corporations responsible for this contamination are held accountable for the harm they have caused to your community and your children.

Our legal team will be in regular contact with you as the case progresses. We will keep you informed of all significant developments, including court filings by the defendants, discovery deadlines, and any settlement discussions that may arise. Your input and cooperation will be essential as we prepare for trial, and we will need your continued participation in depositions and other legal proceedings.

I also want to address the financial aspects of this litigation. As we discussed, our firm is handling this case on a contingency fee basis, which means you will not be responsible for attorney fees unless we achieve a successful outcome. However, litigation expenses such as expert witness fees, court costs, and scientific testing can be substantial in a case of this complexity. We will advance these costs on your behalf and seek reimbursement from any eventual settlement or judgment.

The defendants in this case have already begun assembling their legal teams, and we anticipate they will file motions challenging various aspects of our complaint. This is standard practice in complex litigation, and we are fully prepared to respond to whatever legal challenges they may raise. Our research into similar toxic tort cases across the country has provided us with valuable insights into the defense strategies these corporations typically employ.

Mrs. Anderson, I know that reliving the details of James's illness and death through this legal process will be emotionally difficult for you and your family. Please know that we will do everything possible to minimize the burden on you while still building the strongest possible case. We have social workers and counselors available to provide support to you and the other plaintiff families throughout this process.

The scientific evidence supporting our case continues to strengthen as more research emerges about the health effects of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene exposure. Recent studies have provided additional confirmation of the link between these chemicals and childhood leukemia, which will bolster our arguments at trial. We are also working with epidemiologists to document the unusually high incidence of leukemia in the East Woburn area served by Wells G and H.

In closing, I want to reaffirm our dedication to achieving justice for James and all the children who have suffered because of this contamination. This case represents more than a legal dispute—it is about protecting communities from corporate irresponsibility and ensuring that companies cannot hide behind legal technicalities when their actions harm innocent children.

Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you have any questions or concerns about the case. My direct line is (617) 491-8700, and I am available to discuss any aspect of this litigation with you at any time.

With deepest sympathy for your loss and unwavering commitment to our cause,

Jan Schlichtmann  
Attorney for Plaintiffs
