# WELL SCREEN ASSEMBLY INSTALLATION CERTIFICATION REPORT
## WELL G - EAST WOBURN MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY

**CITY OF WOBURN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS**

---

**TO:** Harold F. Morrison, Director, Department of Public Works  
**FROM:** Thompson Well Drilling & Construction Co.  
**PROJECT:** Municipal Well G Installation and Certification  
**DATE:** May 8, 1964  
**REPORT NO:** TWD-64-0508-G  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Thompson Well Drilling & Construction Co. hereby certifies the successful completion of well screen assembly installation for Municipal Well G, located in the eastern section of Woburn, Massachusetts. The installation was completed on May 6, 1964, with final testing and certification conducted on May 8, 1964. The well has been drilled to a total depth of 88 feet and is equipped with appropriate screening and pumping apparatus to serve as a supplemental water source for the City of Woburn municipal water supply system.

## PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS

**Well Designation:** Municipal Well G  
**Location:** East Woburn, approximately 150 yards southeast of Aberjona River  
**Coordinates:** Latitude 42°29'15"N, Longitude 71°09'42"W  
**Total Depth:** 88 feet below ground surface  
**Casing Diameter:** 12 inches  
**Screen Type:** Johnson stainless steel well screen, slot size 0.020 inches  
**Screen Length:** 20 feet (68-88 foot depth interval)  
**Gravel Pack:** #2-4 silica sand, 10-foot interval surrounding screen assembly  

## GEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS

Drilling operations encountered the following geological sequence:

- **0-8 feet:** Topsoil and fill material, primarily sandy loam with organic matter
- **8-22 feet:** Fine to medium sand with occasional clay lenses
- **22-45 feet:** Medium to coarse sand and gravel, water-bearing
- **45-68 feet:** Fine sand with intermittent silt layers
- **68-88 feet:** Coarse sand and gravel aquifer (primary water-bearing zone)

The primary aquifer zone extends from 68 to 88 feet depth and consists of well-sorted sand and gravel deposits typical of glacial outwash materials common throughout the Aberjona River valley. Static water level was encountered at 32 feet below ground surface during drilling operations.

## INSTALLATION METHODOLOGY

### Drilling Operations
Drilling commenced on April 28, 1964, using rotary drilling methods with bentonite mud circulation. The borehole was maintained at 14-inch diameter to accommodate the 12-inch steel casing and allow for proper gravel pack installation. Drilling proceeded without significant complications, though temporary caving was encountered in the upper sand layers and addressed through continuous mud circulation.

### Casing and Screen Installation
The well casing consists of 12-inch diameter steel pipe with welded joints, installed from surface to 68-foot depth. The bottom 20 feet of the well (68-88 feet) is equipped with Johnson stainless steel well screen, Model J-55, with 0.020-inch slot openings designed to prevent sand infiltration while maximizing water yield. The screen assembly includes a bottom cap and centralizers to ensure proper positioning within the borehole.

### Gravel Pack and Sealing
A gravel pack of #2-4 silica sand was installed around the screen assembly from 58 to 88 feet depth, providing a filter medium and supporting formation stability. Above the gravel pack, a bentonite clay seal was installed from 50 to 58 feet depth to prevent surface contamination. The annular space from ground surface to 50 feet was filled with cement grout to provide additional protection against surface water infiltration.

## PUMP INSTALLATION AND TESTING

A Goulds Model 10HSC submersible pump with 50 horsepower motor was installed at 75-foot depth, suspended on 4-inch steel drop pipe with electrical cable and control wiring. The pump is rated for 500 gallons per minute at 150 feet total dynamic head, suitable for the anticipated demand on this supplemental water source.

### Yield Testing Results
Following installation, the well was subjected to a 72-hour constant rate pumping test to determine sustainable yield and evaluate aquifer characteristics:

- **Test Rate:** 450 gallons per minute
- **Duration:** 72 hours continuous pumping
- **Drawdown at Test Rate:** 18.5 feet after 72 hours
- **Recovery:** 95% recovery within 4 hours of pump shutdown
- **Estimated Sustainable Yield:** 400-450 gallons per minute

Water level measurements during testing indicated good aquifer connectivity and sustainable yield capacity for municipal supply purposes. No significant sand production was observed during testing, confirming proper screen design and installation.

### Water Quality Analysis
Initial water quality samples were collected during pump testing and submitted to Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory for analysis. Results indicate water quality suitable for municipal supply with standard chlorination treatment:

- **pH:** 6.8
- **Total Dissolved Solids:** 245 mg/L
- **Hardness:** 120 mg/L as CaCO₃
- **Iron:** 0.8 mg/L
- **Chloride:** 28 mg/L
- **Nitrate:** 2.1 mg/L
- **Coliform Bacteria:** Absent

Water quality meets Commonwealth of Massachusetts drinking water standards for municipal supply. The slightly elevated iron content is typical for groundwater in this region and will be addressed through the existing municipal treatment system.

## ELECTRICAL AND CONTROL SYSTEMS

The well pump is connected to the municipal electrical supply through a dedicated 480-volt, 3-phase service panel located in the concrete pump house constructed adjacent to the wellhead. Control systems include:

- **Motor Starter:** Square D Class 8536 with overload protection
- **Water Level Controls:** Float switches for automatic operation
- **Pressure Controls:** Pressure switch set for 40-60 psi operating range
- **Flow Measurement:** Venturi meter for production monitoring
- **Emergency Shutdown:** Manual disconnect and emergency stop controls

All electrical work was performed in accordance with National Electrical Code standards and inspected by City of Woburn electrical inspector on May 7, 1964.

## WELLHEAD PROTECTION AND SECURITY

The wellhead is protected by a concrete pump house measuring 8 feet by 12 feet, constructed with reinforced concrete walls and a metal roof. The structure provides weather protection for electrical controls and allows access for maintenance operations. The wellhead itself is sealed with a sanitary well cap and extends 18 inches above the pump house floor to prevent contamination.

A chain-link fence with locking gate encloses the well site, providing security against unauthorized access and vandalism. Warning signs have been posted identifying the facility as a municipal water supply source.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

This installation has been designed and constructed in accordance with:

- Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations for municipal water supply wells
- National Sanitation Foundation standards for well construction
- American Water Works Association standards for water well construction
- City of Woburn municipal specifications for water system infrastructure

All required permits and approvals have been obtained, including:
- Well drilling permit #WD-64-127 issued by Massachusetts Department of Public Health
- Building permit #B-64-0445 issued by City of Woburn Building Department
- Electrical permit #E-64-0289 issued by City of Woburn Electrical Department

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE MAINTENANCE

### Immediate Recommendations
1. **Water Quality Monitoring:** Establish monthly water quality sampling program to monitor changes in groundwater chemistry
2. **Production Records:** Maintain detailed records of daily production, water levels, and pump operating hours
3. **Preventive Maintenance:** Schedule quarterly inspection of pump and electrical systems

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Well Development:** Consider additional well development if sand production occurs during initial operation
2. **Aquifer Protection:** Monitor upgradient land use changes that might affect groundwater quality
3. **Backup Systems:** Plan for backup pumping equipment to ensure continuous service capability
