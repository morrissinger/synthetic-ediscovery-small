# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Cryovac Production Team  
**FROM:** Robert H. Mitchell, Facility Manager  
**DATE:** January 10, 1972  
**RE:** Manufacturing Operations Expansion Authorization

## Authorization for Increased Production Capacity

Following our review of projected market demand for the first quarter of 1972, I am hereby authorizing the expansion of manufacturing operations at our Woburn facility to accommodate increased production requirements. This expansion will involve enhanced utilization of existing equipment and implementation of additional processing shifts to meet our contractual obligations with major food packaging clients.

The production team is authorized to implement the following operational changes effective immediately:

- **Extended Operating Hours**: Production lines 1 through 4 are approved for continuous 24-hour operation Monday through Friday, with reduced weekend schedules as demand requires
- **Solvent Usage Increase**: Monthly allocation for trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) cleaning solvents is increased from 2,800 gallons to 4,200 gallons to support expanded degreasing operations
- **Waste Stream Management**: Current disposal protocols for spent solvents and contaminated materials will continue through our established contractor arrangements with Riley Tanning Company for liquid waste handling

## Operational Procedures

All production supervisors must ensure that existing safety protocols remain in effect during expanded operations. The current practice of disposing cleaning solvents and equipment rinse water through the designated drainage system behind Building 3 will continue as approved. Maintenance staff should monitor the concrete settling area adjacent to the rear parking lot to ensure proper drainage flow during increased waste volumes.

Quality control standards must be maintained throughout the expansion period. Any equipment malfunctions or processing irregularities should be reported immediately to shift supervisors. The recent installation of additional storage tanks near the eastern property boundary provides adequate capacity for raw materials and intermediate processing chemicals required for expanded operations.

## Compliance and Documentation

This authorization supersedes previous production limitations established in the October 1971 operational guidelines. All department heads should maintain appropriate records of materials usage and waste disposal activities in accordance with current company policies. The accounting department has been notified of the increased chemical procurement requirements and associated disposal costs.

I expect full cooperation from all production team members in implementing these changes efficiently. Our facility's contribution to W.R. Grace's overall performance objectives depends on our ability to meet increased market demand while maintaining our established operational standards.

Any questions regarding this authorization should be directed to my office at extension 247.
