## PRODUCTION SUMMARY

Production operations proceeded normally during the day shift with all primary manufacturing lines operational. Cryovac division maintained standard output levels for plastic film production, with no significant equipment downtime reported. Chemical processing units operated within normal parameters throughout the shift period.

Solvent usage remained consistent with previous weeks' consumption patterns. Trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) inventory levels are adequate for continued operations through the remainder of the week. Maintenance crew completed routine equipment inspections on production lines 3 and 4 without identifying any issues requiring immediate attention.

## WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

Routine disposal operations continued as scheduled. Approximately 850 gallons of spent solvents and chemical waste were processed through standard disposal protocols. The majority of this material consisted of TCE and PCE cleaning solutions from production equipment maintenance, along with various chemical residues from manufacturing processes.

Disposal activities were conducted in accordance with established facility procedures. Waste materials were transported to designated areas on the property for processing. No unusual incidents or spills occurred during waste handling operations. All personnel involved in disposal activities followed standard safety protocols and wore appropriate protective equipment as required by company guidelines.

## SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

No reportable safety incidents occurred during the day shift. All personnel completed their assigned duties without injury or exposure incidents. Safety equipment inspections were conducted on schedule, with all systems functioning properly.

Environmental monitoring activities proceeded as planned. Groundwater monitoring wells were checked by maintenance personnel, with readings recorded in the standard logbook. No unusual conditions were observed in the immediate facility area. Weather conditions remained favorable throughout the shift, with no precipitation that would affect outdoor operations or waste handling activities.

## PERSONNEL AND OPERATIONAL NOTES

Full staffing levels were maintained throughout the day shift. All department supervisors reported normal attendance with no significant absences affecting production schedules. Training activities for new employees in the chemical processing division continued as scheduled, with emphasis on proper handling procedures for industrial solvents.

Several local residents made inquiries at the main gate regarding facility operations, consistent with recent community interest in industrial activities in the area. Security personnel handled these interactions professionally and directed inquiries to the appropriate company representatives as per established protocols. No unusual activity was observed in the surrounding neighborhood areas during routine security patrols.

The afternoon shift supervisor has been briefed on all ongoing operations and is prepared to maintain production schedules through the evening hours. All equipment logs and maintenance records have been updated and are available for review. Inventory levels for all major chemical inputs remain adequate for continued operations through the week.
