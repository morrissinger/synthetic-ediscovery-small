# Personal Letter from Kathryn Gamache to Margaret Sullivan

February 1, 1980

Dear Margaret,

I hope this letter finds you and Tom well. I've been putting off writing to you about what's been happening here, but I can't keep it to myself any longer. I need my sister right now, and I don't know who else to turn to.

Roland is sick, Maggie. Really sick. The doctors at Massachusetts General confirmed what we've been fearing for weeks - it's leukemia. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, they called it. When Dr. Morrison first said those words, I felt like the floor had dropped out from under me. Our beautiful boy, only seven years old, and he has cancer.

It started back in November with what we thought was just the flu. Roland kept complaining that he was tired all the time, and he had these bruises that seemed to come from nowhere. You know how active he is - was - always running around the neighborhood with the other kids. But suddenly he didn't want to play anymore. He'd come home from school and just lie on the couch. When the fever wouldn't break and the bruises got worse, Frank insisted we take him to Dr. Patterson. That's when they found his white blood cell count was through the roof.

The worst part, Margaret, is watching him suffer. The treatments at the hospital are so hard on him. The chemotherapy makes him so sick he can barely keep anything down. His hair is starting to fall out in clumps, and yesterday he asked me why God was punishing him. What do you say to that? How do you explain to a seven-year-old that sometimes terrible things just happen?

But here's what's really eating at me - we're not the only family going through this. Do you remember the Anderson boy, Jimmy? He was in Roland's class at the Hurld School. He died last year from the same thing. And there's the Kane boy, Kevin Jr., and little Michael Zona. All of them with leukemia, all of them living right here in our neighborhood. It can't be a coincidence, can it?

Frank thinks I'm losing my mind, but I keep thinking about those wells they closed down last May. Wells G and H - you remember, they're right down by the Aberjona River. The city said they found chemicals in the water, but they never really explained what that meant for us. We've been drinking that water for years, Maggie. Cooking with it, bathing Roland in it when he was a baby. What if that's what made him sick?

I've been talking to some of the other mothers - Anne Anderson, whose Jimmy died, and Mrs. Kane. We all have the same questions, the same fears. There's something wrong in this town, something that's making our children sick. I can't prove it, but in my heart, I know it's connected to those wells.

The financial strain is overwhelming too. Frank's insurance through the plant covers some of the medical bills, but not all of them. The trips to Boston, the medications, the treatments - it's adding up so fast. We might have to take out a second mortgage on the house. I never thought we'd be in this position, choosing between our son's life and our financial future. But what choice do we have?

I need you to know that if something happens to Roland - and I pray to God it doesn't - but if it does, I won't let this go. These companies, whoever they are that poisoned our water, they need to be held accountable. Our children didn't deserve this. No family should have to watch their child suffer like this.

I'm sorry to burden you with all this sadness, but I needed to tell someone who would understand. Could you maybe come visit next weekend? Roland always lights up when Aunt Maggie comes around, and I think seeing you might give him some strength. It would certainly help me.

Please give my love to Tom and the girls. Hug them extra tight for me - you never know how precious these moments are until they might be taken away.

All my love,

Kathryn

P.S. - If you hear anything about other families dealing with childhood cancers in your area, please let me know. I'm starting to think this problem might be bigger than just East Woburn.
