# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Riley Company Legal Department  
**FROM:** John J. Riley, President  
**DATE:** December 8, 1970  
**RE:** Property Use Authorization for Waste Disposal Activities on East Woburn Parcels

## Purpose and Background

This memorandum serves to document the current understanding and authorization regarding waste disposal activities being conducted on company-owned property in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Following recent discussions with operations management and in light of ongoing industrial activities in the area, I am providing formal authorization for continued use of designated areas of our property for the disposal of manufacturing byproducts and related materials.

The Riley Company has maintained operations in the East Woburn industrial corridor since 1952, with our primary facilities located on approximately 15 acres bounded by the Aberjona River to the east and Washington Street to the west. Our manufacturing processes, which include metal finishing and chemical treatment operations, generate various waste materials that require proper disposal in accordance with standard industrial practices of the region.

## Authorization and Scope

Effective immediately and continuing until further notice, I hereby authorize the use of the following designated areas of company property for waste disposal activities:

1. **Area A**: The rear section of Lot 7, approximately 2.3 acres, located behind the main manufacturing building and adjacent to the natural drainage area that flows toward the Aberjona River
2. **Area B**: The northeastern corner of the property, approximately 0.8 acres, situated near the property line with the Grace facility
3. **Area C**: The former gravel pit area, approximately 1.2 areas, which has been previously used for similar disposal activities

These areas are authorized for the disposal of the following materials generated by our operations:
- Metal finishing solvents and cleaning agents
- Degreasing compounds and related chemicals
- Manufacturing process residues
- Contaminated rags, containers, and equipment
- Other industrial byproducts as determined by operations management

## Operational Guidelines

All disposal activities shall be conducted in a manner consistent with standard industrial practices in the region and in accordance with the following guidelines:

**Timing**: Disposal activities may be conducted during regular business hours or as operationally necessary, with preference given to times when such activities will not interfere with normal manufacturing operations.

**Methods**: Materials may be disposed of through direct placement, burial, or other methods as determined appropriate by operations management. The natural drainage characteristics of the designated areas should be utilized to facilitate the efficient movement of liquid wastes away from active work areas.

**Documentation**: While formal documentation of individual disposal events is not required, operations management should maintain general awareness of disposal activities to ensure efficient use of designated areas and to coordinate with ongoing manufacturing schedules.

**Access**: The designated disposal areas shall remain accessible to company personnel and authorized contractors for ongoing disposal activities and periodic maintenance as needed.

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

Based on my understanding of current regulatory requirements, the authorized disposal activities fall within the scope of normal industrial operations and are consistent with practices employed by other manufacturing facilities in the East Woburn industrial area. The company's use of its own property for the disposal of materials generated by its operations represents a reasonable and necessary component of our manufacturing processes.

Should any regulatory authorities raise questions regarding our disposal practices, all inquiries should be directed to the Legal Department for appropriate response. It is my understanding that our current practices are consistent with applicable regulations and industry standards, and that the company maintains appropriate rights to use its property for necessary operational activities.

## Coordination with Other Entities

I am aware that other industrial facilities in the area, including the W.R. Grace Company facility and operations associated with Beatrice Foods, conduct similar disposal activities on their respective properties. Our disposal practices should be coordinated as appropriate with these neighboring operations to ensure efficient use of the industrial corridor and to avoid any unnecessary interference with their activities.

The proximity of our disposal areas to those of neighboring facilities may provide opportunities for coordination or shared use of disposal sites where such arrangements would be mutually beneficial. Operations management is authorized to enter into informal arrangements with neighboring facilities regarding disposal activities where such arrangements would serve the company's interests.

## Authorization and Responsibility

This authorization is issued under my authority as President of the John J. Riley Company and reflects my determination that the specified disposal activities are necessary for the efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities. The Legal Department should maintain this memorandum as documentation of the company's authorization for these activities.

Operations management is directed to conduct all disposal activities in accordance with this authorization and to coordinate with the Legal Department regarding any questions or concerns that may arise. Any modifications to the scope or methods of disposal activities should be discussed with me before implementation.

This authorization shall remain in effect until modified or revoked by subsequent directive. I anticipate that these disposal activities will continue to be necessary for the foreseeable future as an integral component of our manufacturing operations.

## Conclusion

The authorized waste disposal activities represent a necessary and appropriate use of company property in support of our manufacturing operations. These activities are consistent with standard industrial practices in the region and with the company's rights as a property owner to use its land for legitimate business purposes.

The Legal Department should be prepared to defend the company's disposal practices as reasonable and lawful should any challenges arise. Our position should emphasize the necessity of these activities for our operations, their consistency with industry practices, and the company's right to use its property for legitimate business purposes.

I am confident that the authorized disposal activities will continue to serve the company's operational needs while remaining within appropriate legal and regulatory boundaries. Operations management should proceed with these activities as authorized and should coordinate with the Legal Department regarding any issues that may arise.
