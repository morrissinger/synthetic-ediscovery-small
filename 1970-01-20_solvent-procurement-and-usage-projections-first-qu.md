# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** W.R. Grace Purchasing Department  
**FROM:** Thomas Henderson, Production Planning Supervisor  
**DATE:** January 20, 1970  
**RE:** Solvent Procurement and Usage Projections First Quarter 1970

## Summary of Chemical Requirements

Based on production schedules for Q1 1970 and current inventory levels at our Woburn facility, I am submitting the following procurement requirements for industrial solvents essential to our manufacturing operations. These projections reflect anticipated production volumes and account for normal operational losses.

**Primary Solvent Requirements:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 8,500 gallons
- Perchloroethylene (PCE): 6,200 gallons
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 4,800 gallons
- Carbon Tetrachloride: 2,100 gallons

Our degreasing operations continue to require substantial quantities of TCE and PCE for cleaning metal components prior to coating processes. The Cryovac division's packaging operations also maintain steady demand for these chlorinated solvents in their sealing and cleaning procedures. Current storage capacity at the Woburn plant can accommodate these volumes with existing tank infrastructure.

## Disposal Considerations

Normal operational procedures will continue for handling spent solvents and contaminated materials. Our current disposal methods, including on-site handling of waste materials, have proven cost-effective and efficient for maintaining production schedules. The designated disposal area behind Building C remains adequate for current waste volumes, and no additional infrastructure modifications are anticipated for Q1 operations.

I recommend expedited procurement of the TCE and PCE quantities given the January production surge and current inventory drawdown. Standard delivery to the Woburn facility loading dock should be coordinated with Plant Operations Manager Bill McKenzie to ensure proper handling and storage protocols are followed.

Please confirm receipt of this request and provide estimated delivery schedules for the primary solvent requirements by January 30, 1970.
