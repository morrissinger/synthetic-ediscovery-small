Re: **Agreement to Join Woburn Legal Team as Co-Counsel**

Dear Jan,

Following our productive telephone conversations over the past two weeks and your detailed briefing materials regarding the tragic circumstances in Woburn, I am writing to formalize Trial Lawyers for Public Justice's commitment to join your legal team as co-counsel in the matter of *Anderson, et al. v. W.R. Grace & Co., et al.*

## Background and Case Assessment

Your documentation of the childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn presents one of the most compelling toxic tort cases I have encountered in my fifteen years of environmental litigation. The death of James Anderson on January 18, 1981, at age twelve, after a nine-year battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia, represents not merely a personal tragedy but a fundamental breach of corporate responsibility that demands legal redress. The preliminary evidence you have gathered regarding the contamination of Wells G and H with trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene at levels far exceeding safe exposure limits establishes a prima facie case for environmental poisoning.

The corporate defendants you have identified—W.R. Grace Company through its Cryovac division, Beatrice Foods, and John J. Riley Company—represent substantial industrial entities with significant legal resources. However, the strength of the scientific evidence linking their chemical disposal practices to groundwater contamination, combined with the tragic human consequences documented in your client interviews, creates a compelling foundation for both compensatory and punitive damages.

## Organizational Commitment and Resources

Trial Lawyers for Public Justice brings considerable expertise in complex environmental litigation to this matter. Our organization has successfully prosecuted toxic tort cases against major corporations, including recent victories involving groundwater contamination in California and chemical exposure cases in the industrial Midwest. I personally have handled seventeen major environmental cases over the past decade, including the landmark *Citizens Against Toxic Exposure v. Dow Chemical* matter that resulted in a $12.8 million settlement.

We are prepared to commit the following resources to the Woburn litigation:

**Legal Personnel:** I will serve as lead environmental counsel, with support from Associate Attorney Patricia Williamson, who specializes in medical causation issues in toxic tort cases. Research Attorney Michael Chen will provide case law analysis and regulatory interpretation support.

**Expert Witness Network:** Our established relationships with leading environmental scientists, hydrogeologists, and epidemiologists will be crucial in establishing the causal connection between defendant companies' chemical disposal practices and the childhood leukemia cluster. Dr. Robert Harris of the Environmental Defense Fund has already expressed willingness to serve as our primary groundwater contamination expert.

**Financial Resources:** We are prepared to advance up to $150,000 in litigation costs, including expert witness fees, scientific testing, document discovery expenses, and trial preparation costs.

## Legal Strategy and Case Development

Based on my review of your preliminary investigation, I recommend pursuing a multi-pronged legal strategy:

**Primary Tort Claims:** Negligence, strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities, nuisance, and trespass. The defendants' disposal of industrial solvents in unlined lagoons and direct discharge to groundwater constitutes conduct so unreasonable as to support punitive damages.

**Regulatory Violations:** The defendants' apparent violations of Massachusetts environmental regulations and potential federal Clean Water Act violations strengthen our tort claims and may support additional statutory penalties.

**Class Action Certification:** While the Anderson family tragedy provides the most compelling individual case, the broader pattern of childhood leukemia in the affected area suggests potential for class action treatment to maximize recovery for all affected families.

**Scientific Causation:** We must establish both general causation (that TCE and PCE exposure can cause childhood leukemia) and specific causation (that exposure from Wells G and H caused the leukemia cases in question). Our expert witness strategy will be crucial to meeting the *Daubert* standard for scientific evidence.

## Fee Arrangement and Cost Sharing

I propose the following fee and cost arrangement:

**Contingency Fee:** Standard one-third contingency fee to be split equally between our firms (16.67% each), with the understanding that if the case proceeds to trial, the division may be adjusted based on actual work performed.

**Cost Advancement:** Each firm will advance costs proportional to its anticipated involvement. Trial Lawyers for Public Justice will advance 60% of major costs (expert witnesses, scientific testing, document production), with your firm handling 40% (local counsel expenses, client coordination, day-to-day case management).

**Settlement Authority:** All settlement decisions require unanimous agreement between co-counsel, with final authority resting with the clients.

## Immediate Action Items

To move this case forward expeditiously, I recommend the following immediate steps:

1. **Client Interviews:** I will travel to Woburn the week of October 12 to meet personally with Anne Anderson and other affected families to assess damages and gather additional factual evidence.

2. **Document Preservation:** We should immediately serve document preservation notices on all defendants to prevent destruction of records relating to chemical disposal practices, environmental monitoring, and corporate decision-making.

3. **Expert Retention:** Formal retention of Dr. Harris and identification of additional experts in pediatric oncology and environmental epidemiology.

4. **Regulatory Coordination:** Initial contact with EPA Region I and Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering to coordinate our civil litigation with any potential regulatory enforcement actions.

## Conclusion

The Woburn case represents exactly the type of environmental justice matter that Trial Lawyers for Public Justice was founded to pursue. The combination of corporate environmental irresponsibility, regulatory failure, and tragic human consequences demands aggressive legal action. I am confident that our joint representation will maximize the prospects for both meaningful compensation for the affected families and deterrent effect on future corporate environmental misconduct.

Please review the proposed terms outlined above and contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss any modifications or additional considerations. I am prepared to execute a formal co-counsel agreement incorporating these terms within the next week, allowing us to proceed immediately with case development.

The families of Woburn deserve justice, and I am honored to join you in pursuing it.

Very truly yours,
