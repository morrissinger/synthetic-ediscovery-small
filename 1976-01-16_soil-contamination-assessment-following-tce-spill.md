## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This assessment documents soil contamination conditions following the trichloroethylene (TCE) release incident that occurred on December 18, 1975, at our Woburn manufacturing facility located at 1 Grace Avenue. Initial field observations and preliminary soil sampling indicate significant subsurface contamination extending beyond the immediate spill area. The affected zone encompasses approximately 2.3 acres of facility property, with potential migration pathways toward the adjacent wetland areas and underlying groundwater aquifer.

Based on current findings, immediate containment measures are recommended to prevent further migration of TCE-contaminated materials. This incident represents a continuation of operational challenges related to solvent handling and disposal practices that have been documented in previous facility assessments.

## INCIDENT BACKGROUND

On December 18, 1975, at approximately 14:20 hours, facility personnel reported a significant release of trichloroethylene from Storage Tank 7, located in the northeast quadrant of the facility property. The release occurred during a routine transfer operation when a corroded valve assembly failed, resulting in the discharge of an estimated 850 gallons of TCE onto the surrounding soil and gravel surfaces.

Initial response efforts included shutting down the transfer system and deploying absorbent materials around the immediate spill area. However, the volume of released material exceeded the capacity of available containment measures, allowing substantial quantities of TCE to penetrate the soil column and migrate laterally across the facility grounds.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident included light precipitation and temperatures of 38°F, which may have accelerated the vertical migration of spilled materials through the soil profile.

## METHODOLOGY

### Field Investigation Procedures

Soil sampling was conducted using hollow-stem auger drilling techniques at twelve locations across the affected area. Sample points were established on a grid pattern extending from the primary spill location to a distance of 200 feet in all directions. Drilling depths ranged from 8 to 15 feet below ground surface, with samples collected at 2-foot intervals.

All samples were collected in accordance with standard chain-of-custody procedures and transported to Northeastern Analytical Laboratory in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, for analysis. Laboratory testing included gas chromatography analysis for volatile organic compounds, with specific focus on trichloroethylene concentrations.

### Hydrogeological Assessment

Groundwater monitoring was conducted at three existing observation wells (MW-1, MW-2, MW-3) located within 500 feet of the spill area. Water level measurements were recorded to determine groundwater flow direction and gradient. Groundwater samples were collected using bailer techniques and submitted for TCE analysis.

Site geology was evaluated through examination of soil boring logs and previous geotechnical investigations. The subsurface profile consists of sandy fill materials overlying native glacial till deposits, with groundwater encountered at depths ranging from 8 to 12 feet below ground surface.

## FINDINGS

### Soil Contamination Results

Laboratory analysis confirms extensive TCE contamination throughout the investigated area. Soil concentrations range from 45 parts per million (ppm) at the periphery of the spill zone to 2,340 ppm directly beneath the failed storage tank. These concentrations significantly exceed background levels and indicate substantial environmental impact.

**Soil Sample Results (TCE Concentrations in ppm):**

- SP-1 (Tank 7 vicinity): 2,340 ppm at 4-6 ft depth
- SP-2 (50 ft northeast): 1,890 ppm at 6-8 ft depth  
- SP-3 (100 ft northeast): 1,245 ppm at 8-10 ft depth
- SP-4 (150 ft northeast): 678 ppm at 10-12 ft depth
- SP-5 (200 ft northeast): 156 ppm at 12-14 ft depth
- SP-6 (wetland boundary): 89 ppm at 6-8 ft depth
- SP-7 through SP-12: 45-234 ppm at various depths

The contamination plume extends in a northeast direction, following the natural topographic gradient toward the wetland areas that connect to the Aberjona River watershed. This migration pattern is consistent with regional groundwater flow directions and indicates potential for off-site environmental impact.

### Groundwater Contamination

Groundwater samples from monitoring wells MW-1 and MW-2 show detectable TCE concentrations of 23 ppm and 67 ppm respectively. Well MW-3, located upgradient of the spill area, shows no detectable contamination, confirming that the observed groundwater impact results from the December 18 release incident.

Groundwater flow direction is northeast at an estimated velocity of 0.3 feet per day, based on hydraulic conductivity measurements and observed gradient conditions. This flow pattern directs contaminated groundwater toward the wetland complex located approximately 800 feet from the facility boundary.

### Environmental Impact Assessment

The extent of soil and groundwater contamination indicates significant environmental impact extending beyond facility property boundaries. TCE migration through the soil column has reached the water table, creating a persistent source of groundwater contamination that will continue to migrate downgradient unless remedial action is implemented.

The affected wetland areas provide habitat for waterfowl and connect to surface water bodies that may serve as sources for municipal water supply systems. Continued migration of TCE-contaminated groundwater poses potential risks to these environmental resources and may require notification of appropriate regulatory agencies.

## CONCLUSIONS

The December 18, 1975, TCE release represents a significant environmental incident requiring immediate remedial response. Soil contamination extends across 2.3 acres of facility property, with groundwater impact confirmed at concentrations that pose ongoing environmental risks.

Current contamination levels exceed typical industrial cleanup standards and indicate the need for comprehensive remediation efforts. The migration pathway toward sensitive environmental areas increases the urgency of implementing containment and cleanup measures.

This incident highlights ongoing operational deficiencies in chemical storage and handling systems that have contributed to previous environmental releases at the facility. Without systematic improvements to storage tank integrity and spill prevention systems, similar incidents are likely to occur in the future.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Excavation and Removal:** Excavate heavily contaminated soils (>1,000 ppm TCE) from the immediate spill area and arrange for off-site disposal at an approved hazardous waste facility.

2. **Groundwater Containment:** Install additional monitoring wells downgradient of the spill area to track contaminant migration and evaluate the need for groundwater extraction systems.

3. **Tank System Inspection:** Conduct comprehensive integrity testing of all chemical storage tanks and associated piping systems to identify potential failure points before additional releases occur.

4. **Spill Prevention:** Implement enhanced secondary containment systems around all chemical storage areas, including impermeable berming and leak detection systems.

### Long-Term Remediation

1. **Soil Treatment:** Evaluate in-situ treatment technologies for moderately contaminated soils that cannot be practically excavated, including soil vapor extraction or chemical treatment systems.

2. **Groundwater Monitoring:** Establish quarterly groundwater monitoring program to track contamination migration and evaluate remediation effectiveness.

3. **Wetland Protection:** Install monitoring points along the facility boundary to provide early warning of contaminant migration toward sensitive environmental areas.

4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Prepare documentation for potential regulatory reporting requirements and maintain records of all remediation activities.

### Cost Estimates

Preliminary cost estimates for recommended remediation activities range from $185,000 to $340,000, depending on the extent of soil excavation required and the complexity of groundwater treatment systems. These estimates do not include potential costs associated with off-site environmental impacts or regulatory enforcement actions.
