## DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

### **Waste Solvent Disposal**
During September, approximately 420 gallons of spent solvents and cleaning solutions were removed from the facility. Disposal was conducted through the following methods:

- **Lagoon System**: 280 gallons of diluted cleaning solutions and process water were directed to the on-site lagoon system for settling and natural breakdown
- **Drum Storage**: 140 gallons of concentrated waste solvents were placed in 55-gallon drums and staged in the rear storage yard pending pickup by approved disposal contractor

### **Solid Waste Disposal**
Chemical-contaminated materials including rags, filters, and packaging materials totaling approximately 180 cubic feet were removed to the designated disposal area behind Building 3.

## STORAGE CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Current chemical storage utilization stands at 78% of total capacity. Building 3 solvent storage is approaching maximum capacity at 92% utilization. The following tanks require attention:

- **Tank A-4**: Showing minor seepage at base connection; scheduled for inspection
- **Tank B-1**: Requires cleaning and recoating of interior surface
- **Drum Storage Area**: Currently at 85% capacity with 34 drums in storage

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE NOTES

All chemical storage and handling procedures continue to follow established plant protocols. Monthly inspection of storage areas completed on September 12, 1964, with no significant issues identified. Fire department inspection scheduled for October 1964 has been confirmed.

Chemical inventory records are maintained in accordance with company policy and are available for review by management or regulatory authorities as required.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Action Required**: Schedule maintenance on Tank A-4 to address seepage issue before October inventory cycle.

2. **Storage Expansion**: Consider additional drum storage capacity in Building 3 to accommodate increased solvent requirements for Q4 production schedule.

3. **Disposal Efficiency**: Evaluate frequency of waste solvent pickup to maintain adequate storage space for ongoing operations.

4. **Safety Protocol**: Review chemical handling procedures with production staff, particularly regarding proper ventilation during solvent transfer operations.

5. **Documentation**: Implement enhanced tracking system for waste disposal activities to ensure complete records for all chemical waste streams.

## CONCLUSION

Chemical inventory levels remain adequate to support current production requirements. Storage capacity limitations in Building 3 require attention to prevent operational disruptions. All disposal activities have been conducted in accordance with established procedures, and no safety incidents were reported during the reporting period.

The facility continues to maintain efficient chemical management practices while meeting the production demands of our expanding shrink-wrap packaging operations. Regular monitoring of inventory levels and storage conditions will ensure continued operational effectiveness.
