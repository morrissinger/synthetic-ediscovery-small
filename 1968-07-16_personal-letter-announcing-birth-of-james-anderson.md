# Personal Letter

**July 16, 1968**

Dear Family,

I hope this letter finds you all in good health and spirits. Charles and I are overjoyed to share the wonderful news that our son, James Anderson, was born on July 12, 1968, at 2:47 AM at Winchester Hospital. He weighed 7 pounds, 3 ounces and measured 20 inches long. Both James and I are doing very well, and we came home yesterday afternoon.

The delivery went smoothly, though it was quite an adventure getting to the hospital in the middle of the night! Charles was so nervous he nearly forgot to bring the suitcase we had packed weeks ago. Dr. Morrison was excellent throughout the entire process, and the nursing staff at Winchester Hospital couldn't have been more caring and professional. James is such a beautiful baby - he has Charles's dark hair and what appear to be my blue eyes, though the doctor says it's too early to tell for certain what color they'll be.

We've settled into our home here on Pine Street in East Woburn quite nicely. The neighborhood is perfect for raising children - there are several young families nearby, and the elementary school is just a few blocks away. Our house has a lovely backyard where James will be able to play when he's older. Charles has been working steady hours at the plant, and we feel very fortunate to be building our life here in Woburn. The community has been so welcoming, and we've already made friends with the Toomeys next door, who have a young son named Patrick who's about two years old.

I must say, becoming a mother feels both natural and overwhelming at the same time. James is such a good baby - he sleeps for three to four hour stretches, which I'm told is quite remarkable for a newborn. The pediatrician, Dr. Truman, examined him thoroughly and pronounced him perfectly healthy. We're planning to have him baptized at St. Charles Church next month, and we would love for as many family members as possible to attend the ceremony.

Charles has been absolutely wonderful through all of this. He's taken a few days off from work to help me adjust to having the baby home, and he's already proving to be a devoted father. Last night he walked the floor with James for nearly an hour when the baby was fussy, singing old Irish songs that his own father used to sing to him. It's moments like these that make me realize how blessed we are to have this new little life to care for and love.

We're looking forward to introducing James to all of you very soon. Mother, I know you're eager to meet your newest grandson, and we're planning to drive up to see you and Dad as soon as Dr. Morrison gives us the all-clear for James to travel. Charles's parents are equally excited and have already started spoiling the baby with gifts - they brought over a beautiful wooden cradle that Charles's grandfather made by hand many years ago.

Please give our love to everyone, and we can't wait to share this joy with the entire family. James is truly a blessing, and we feel so grateful for this wonderful addition to our lives here in Woburn.

With all our love,

Anne

P.S. - Charles asks me to tell Uncle Robert that he's already started a college fund for James, putting aside a little each week from his paycheck. He says it's never too early to start planning for the future!
