Vice President Thomas P. Riley presented the annual production summary:

- **Total Hides Processed:** 47,230 units (8% increase over 1962)
- **Primary Products:** Industrial leather goods, automotive components, military specifications leather
- **Chemical Usage:** Chromium compounds, acids, solvents maintained at standard levels
- **Waste Processing:** Continued disposal through established drainage systems and burial methods on company property

Thomas reported that production efficiency had improved significantly with the installation of new vat systems in the summer months. The military contracts secured through Massachusetts procurement offices had provided steady revenue throughout the fiscal year.

- **Operating Expenses:** $198,320
- **Net Profit:** $89,130
- **Family Distribution:** $71,304 allocated among active family members
- **Reinvestment Reserve:** $17,826 retained for facility improvements

Margaret noted that the company's financial position remained strong despite increased competition from synthetic materials manufacturers. The family's conservative fiscal management had maintained adequate cash reserves for operational continuity.

#### IV. FACILITY OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

Production Supervisor Robert J. Riley reported on facility conditions:

**Infrastructure Status:**
- Main processing building: Good condition, minor roof repairs completed
- Chemical storage areas: Adequate capacity, some concrete deterioration noted
- Drainage systems: Functioning within normal parameters
- Waste disposal areas: Sufficient capacity for current operations

Robert recommended allocation of $12,000 for concrete repairs in the chemical storage areas and expansion of the waste disposal pits on the southwestern portion of the property. He noted that the proximity to the railroad tracks continued to provide excellent transportation access for raw materials and finished goods.

#### V. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE MATTERS

Quality Control Manager Catherine Riley Murphy addressed regulatory considerations:

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health had conducted its routine inspection in September 1963 with no significant violations noted. Standard leather processing operations were found to be in compliance with existing industrial regulations. The company maintained its permits for chemical usage and waste disposal through established channels.

Catherine emphasized that the family business had operated for over five decades without major regulatory difficulties, demonstrating the soundness of traditional leather processing methods. She recommended continued cooperation with state inspectors and maintenance of all required documentation.

#### VI. FUTURE PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS

**Market Outlook:**
President Riley discussed industry trends affecting leather manufacturing. While synthetic materials posed increasing competition, demand remained strong for high-quality leather products, particularly in automotive and military applications. The family agreed to maintain focus on premium leather production rather than competing in lower-grade markets.

**Facility Expansion:**
The possibility of expanding operations was discussed, with particular attention to the availability of additional land adjacent to current facilities. Thomas Riley noted that property values in the East Woburn industrial area remained reasonable, and expansion could be considered if market conditions warranted increased production capacity.

**Succession Planning:**
John J. Riley, now 74 years of age, indicated his intention to gradually transfer operational responsibilities to the next generation while maintaining advisory oversight. Thomas P. Riley would assume increased executive responsibilities, with Robert J. Riley taking expanded production management duties.

#### VII. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

Maintenance Supervisor James M. Riley reported on environmental matters affecting facility operations:

The Aberjona River, which flows along the eastern boundary of the property, had shown no unusual conditions during the year. Standard waste disposal practices, including chemical residue burial and liquid waste drainage, continued without incident. The groundwater monitoring well installed in 1961 showed normal readings consistent with previous years.

James noted that waste disposal costs had remained stable, with the company's established practices proving both economical and effective. The family agreed to continue current waste management procedures, which had served the operation successfully since its founding.

#### VIII. PERSONNEL MATTERS

The company employed 23 full-time workers in addition to family members, with employment levels remaining steady throughout 1963. Wage increases averaging 4% were approved for the coming year, maintaining competitive compensation within the local industrial sector.

Safety training programs were reviewed, with emphasis on proper handling of chemical materials and compliance with Massachusetts industrial safety requirements. No significant workplace injuries had occurred during the fiscal year.

#### IX. COMMUNITY RELATIONS

President Riley reported on the company's standing within the East Woburn community. The Riley family had maintained positive relationships with neighboring businesses and residential areas throughout the company's 54-year history. Local civic contributions included support for the East Woburn Fire Department and annual donations to St. Charles Catholic Church.

The family agreed to continue its tradition of community involvement while maintaining focus on business operations and family employment priorities.
