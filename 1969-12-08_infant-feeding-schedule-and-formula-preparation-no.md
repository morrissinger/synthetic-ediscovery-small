3. Let cool to room temperature 
4. Mix formula as needed throughout day
5. Warm bottles in pan of hot water before feeding

**Sterilization:**
- Bottles and nipples boiled every morning for 10 minutes
- Use tongs to remove from boiling water
- Store in clean covered pot until needed

## Recent Observations

**Weight Gain:** Patrick weighed 16 lbs 4 oz at 5-month checkup (December 3rd) - Dr. Henderson says this is good progress

**Appetite:** Very good appetite, usually finishes bottles completely. Sometimes wants extra ounce in evening bottles.

**Digestion:** Generally good. Had some loose stools last week (Nov 30 - Dec 3) but seems better now. Dr. Henderson said this is normal for formula-fed babies.

**Sleep Patterns:** Sleeping through most nights now. Goes down around 10:30 PM, usually sleeps until 6:00 AM.

**New Foods Introduced:**
- Rice cereal (started November 15th) - tolerating well
- Strained carrots (started November 28th) - likes these
- Planning to try green beans next week per Dr. Henderson's advice

## Water Quality Notes

**Taste:** Sometimes the tap water has a slightly sweet taste, especially in the mornings. Richard says it's just the way city water tastes - different from well water we had growing up.

**Appearance:** Water looks clear after boiling and cooling. Occasionally see small particles settle at bottom of pot, but Dr. Henderson says boiling takes care of any bacteria.

**Preparation Changes:** Started using the water from kitchen tap instead of bathroom tap (November 20th) because kitchen faucet runs clearer. Always let it run for a minute or two before collecting water for boiling.

## Health Observations

**General Health:** Patrick seems healthy and alert. Good color, active during wake periods.

**Recent Concerns:**
- Small rash on chest area (appeared December 5th) - using baby powder as Mrs. Sullivan next door suggested
- Slight congestion last week but cleared up on its own
- Dr. Henderson says everything looks normal for 5-month development

**Next Appointment:** January 15, 1970 for 6-month checkup and possible vaccination schedule discussion

## Notes for Richard

- Need to pick up more Similac powder this week - running low
- Ask Dr. Henderson about starting strained fruits at next visit
- Patrick seems ready for high chair - maybe Christmas present?
- Remember to mention the rash if it doesn't clear up by weekend

**Emergency Contact:** Dr. Robert Henderson - Madison 4-7721
