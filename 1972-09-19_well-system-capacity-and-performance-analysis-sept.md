# WELL SYSTEM CAPACITY AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
## SEPTEMBER 1972

**TO:** Harold T. McKenna, Director of Public Works  
**FROM:** Robert M. Sullivan, Water Department Superintendent  
**DATE:** September 19, 1972  
**RE:** Quarterly Analysis of Wells G and H System Performance

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the operational capacity and performance characteristics of municipal Wells G and H for the period of June through August 1972. The analysis encompasses pumping rates, water quality parameters, distribution system integration, and operational efficiency metrics. Wells G and H continue to serve as critical supplemental sources for the Woburn municipal water system, particularly during peak demand periods in the eastern service area.

## OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### Pumping Capacity and Utilization

During the reporting period, Wells G and H demonstrated consistent operational performance within design parameters. Well G maintained an average pumping rate of 340 gallons per minute during active periods, representing 85% of maximum capacity. Well H averaged 295 gallons per minute, or 84% of maximum capacity.

**Monthly Pumping Summary:**
- **June 1972:** Combined output of 18.2 million gallons
- **July 1972:** Combined output of 21.7 million gallons  
- **August 1972:** Combined output of 19.8 million gallons

Peak demand periods occurred during the third week of July, coinciding with elevated residential consumption and industrial demand from facilities along the Aberjona River corridor. During these periods, both wells operated at maximum capacity for extended periods of 8-12 hours daily.

### Water Quality Parameters

Routine water quality testing conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations indicates compliance with all applicable standards for municipal water supply systems. Testing performed by the state-certified laboratory at Middlesex County Health Department shows the following results for the reporting period:

**Bacteriological Analysis:**
- Coliform bacteria: Negative in all samples
- Total bacterial count: Within acceptable limits
- Chlorine residual: Maintained at 0.5-1.0 ppm throughout distribution system

**Chemical Analysis:**
- pH: 6.8-7.2 (within acceptable range)
- Hardness: 85-95 ppm as CaCO3
- Iron content: 0.15-0.25 ppm
- Chloride content: 22-28 ppm
- Total dissolved solids: 180-220 ppm

All chemical parameters remain within Massachusetts drinking water standards. The slightly elevated iron content is consistent with natural groundwater characteristics in this geological formation and does not exceed regulatory limits.

### Distribution System Integration

Wells G and H operate as part of an integrated distribution network serving approximately 2,400 residential connections in East Woburn. The wells are connected to the main distribution system through 12-inch transmission mains that tie into the primary distribution grid at the intersection of Main Street (Route 38) and Montvale Avenue.

**Service Area Demographics:**
- Residential connections: 2,387
- Commercial connections: 47
- Industrial connections: 3
- Average daily demand: 650,000 gallons
- Peak daily demand: 980,000 gallons (recorded July 22, 1972)

The wells provide supplemental capacity during periods when demand exceeds the capability of the primary water treatment facility on Salem Street. This typically occurs during summer months when residential irrigation and cooling demands increase substantially.

## OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY METRICS

### Power Consumption Analysis

Electrical consumption for Wells G and H during the reporting period totaled 14,750 kilowatt-hours, representing a 7% increase over the same period in 1971. This increase correlates with extended operational periods necessitated by higher summer demand.

**Cost Analysis:**
- Electrical costs: $441.75
- Maintenance and repairs: $127.50
- Chemical treatment (chlorination): $89.25
- Total operational costs: $658.50

Cost per thousand gallons produced: $0.011

### Equipment Performance

Both well pumps continue to operate within manufacturer specifications. Well G pump (installed 1964) shows minor efficiency degradation consistent with normal wear patterns. Recommended maintenance includes impeller inspection and bearing replacement scheduled for November 1972.

Well H pump (installed 1966) demonstrates optimal performance with no maintenance requirements beyond routine lubrication and electrical system inspection.

## AQUIFER PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

### Static Water Levels

Monthly measurements of static water levels indicate stable aquifer conditions:

**Well G Static Levels:**
- June: 42.3 feet below surface
- July: 43.1 feet below surface  
- August: 42.8 feet below surface

**Well H Static Levels:**
- June: 41.7 feet below surface
- July: 42.4 feet below surface
- August: 42.1 feet below surface

The slight seasonal variation in static levels is consistent with normal aquifer response to precipitation patterns and regional groundwater flow. No evidence of aquifer depletion or interference between wells has been observed.

### Drawdown Characteristics

Pumping tests conducted in August 1972 confirm that both wells maintain acceptable drawdown characteristics. Well G shows 8.2 feet of drawdown at maximum pumping rate, while Well H shows 7.8 feet of drawdown. These values are within design parameters and indicate healthy aquifer yield.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Short-term Operational Improvements

1. **Pump Efficiency Optimization:** Schedule impeller inspection for Well G to restore optimal efficiency and reduce power consumption.

2. **Chlorination System Upgrade:** Install automated chlorine feed system to ensure consistent disinfection levels and reduce manual monitoring requirements.

3. **Flow Meter Calibration:** Conduct annual calibration of flow measurement equipment to maintain accurate production records.

### Long-term System Planning

1. **Capacity Expansion Assessment:** Evaluate feasibility of increasing pumping capacity to meet projected demand growth in East Woburn service area.

2. **Backup Power Installation:** Consider installation of emergency generator capacity to ensure continued operation during power outages.

3. **Water Quality Monitoring Enhancement:** Implement quarterly comprehensive chemical analysis to supplement routine bacteriological testing.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All operations during the reporting period maintained full compliance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations governing municipal water supply systems. Required monthly reports have been submitted to the state agency, and all testing protocols have been followed according to established schedules.

The wells continue to operate under Water Supply Permit WS-472-B issued by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, which authorizes combined withdrawal of up to 1.2 million gallons per day from the East Woburn aquifer system.

---

## CONCLUSION

Wells G and H continue to provide reliable supplemental water supply capacity for the Woburn municipal system. Operational performance during the summer 2972 period demonstrates the wells' ability to meet peak demand requirements while maintaining water quality standards. The aquifer shows stable yield characteristics with no indication of depletion or contamination.

Recommended maintenance activities and system improvements will ensure continued reliable operation and optimize efficiency for the upcoming fiscal year. The wells represent a valuable asset in meeting the growing water supply needs of East Woburn's residential and commercial development.
