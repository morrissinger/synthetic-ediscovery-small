## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND REQUEST

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health hereby formally requests immediate technical assistance and epidemiological support from the Centers for Disease Control in investigating a suspected cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn, Massachusetts. This request is submitted under the authority of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 5, and pursuant to federal cooperative agreement provisions for environmental health emergencies.

Based on preliminary investigations conducted by this Department, we have identified a statistically significant excess of childhood leukemia cases in a geographically defined area of East Woburn that correlates with the service area of municipal water Wells G and H. These wells were closed in May 1979 following the detection of volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethylene, in concentrations exceeding established safety thresholds.

The gravity of this situation, involving potential causation between industrial chemical contamination and pediatric malignancies, necessitates the specialized expertise and resources available through CDC's environmental health and epidemiological investigation capabilities.

## II. BACKGROUND AND JURISDICTIONAL BASIS

### A. Municipal Water System Context

Wells G and H commenced operations in 1964 and 1966 respectively as supplemental water sources for the City of Woburn. These wells drew from an aquifer system within the Aberjona River Valley, serving approximately 5,000 residents in eastern Woburn neighborhoods. During their fifteen-year operational period, these wells provided between 20-40% of the municipal water supply to the affected service area.

### B. Industrial Operations and Contamination Sources

Our preliminary investigation has identified two primary industrial facilities whose operations and waste disposal practices may have contributed to groundwater contamination:

**W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc.**  
Location: 369 Washington Street, East Woburn  
Operations: Chemical manufacturing, packaging machinery production  
Chemical Usage: Trichloroethylene, industrial solvents, organic compounds  
Waste Disposal: On-site disposal of chemical waste products documented

**Beatrice Foods Inc./John J. Riley Company**  
Location: 228 Salem Street, East Woburn  
Operations: Leather tanning, hide processing  
Chemical Usage: Industrial solvents, tanning chemicals  
Property: 14.73-acre facility including undeveloped land areas

### C. Contamination Discovery and Well Closure

In May 1979, routine volatile organic compound testing of Wells G and H revealed the presence of trichloroethylene and other industrial chemicals at concentrations warranting immediate well closure. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering ordered cessation of operations pending comprehensive contamination assessment.

## III. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONCERNS AND PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

### A. Childhood Leukemia Case Identification

Since January 1979, this Department has received reports of multiple childhood leukemia diagnoses among residents served by Wells G and H. Preliminary case identification has documented the following:

1. **Confirmed Cases:** Seven (7) cases of childhood leukemia diagnosed between 1972-1979
2. **Age Range:** All cases involve children under 15 years of age at diagnosis
3. **Geographic Clustering:** All cases reside within the Wells G and H service area
4. **Temporal Pattern:** Increased incidence noted following well operations

### B. Statistical Significance Assessment

Based on standard epidemiological analysis methods and utilizing Massachusetts cancer registry data for comparison, the observed rate of childhood leukemia in the affected area exceeds expected incidence by a factor of approximately 6.5 times the state average. This excess represents a statistically significant cluster requiring immediate investigation.

### C. Affected Families and Documented Damages

The following families have been identified as affected parties in this investigation:

- **Anderson Family:** James Anderson, diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia, age 3
- **Kane Family:** Kevin Kane Jr., diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia, age 2  
- **Zona Family:** Michael Zona, diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia, age 5
- **Toomey Family:** Patrick Toomey, diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia, age 4
- **Robbins Family:** Carl Robbins III, diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia, age 2
- **Gamache Family:** Roland Gamache, diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia, age 6

Each family has incurred substantial medical expenses, emotional distress, and in several cases, loss of life. The potential causative relationship between industrial chemical exposure through contaminated drinking water and these pediatric malignancies presents significant legal and public health implications.

## IV. SPECIFIC CDC ASSISTANCE REQUESTED

### A. Epidemiological Investigation Support

1. **Case-Control Study Design:** Technical assistance in developing comprehensive epidemiological study protocols
2. **Exposure Assessment:** Guidance on environmental exposure modeling and biomarker analysis
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Advanced statistical methods for cluster analysis and causation assessment
4. **Registry Coordination:** Integration with national cancer surveillance systems

### B. Environmental Health Assessment

1. **Toxicological Evaluation:** Assessment of health effects associated with identified chemical contaminants
2. **Exposure Pathway Analysis:** Comprehensive evaluation of contamination migration and exposure routes
3. **Risk Assessment:** Quantitative analysis of health risks associated with historical exposures

### C. Laboratory and Technical Resources

1. **Analytical Chemistry Support:** Advanced testing capabilities for environmental and biological samples
2. **Quality Assurance:** Laboratory certification and quality control protocols
3. **Data Management:** Electronic data systems for case tracking and analysis

## V. LEGAL AND REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS

This investigation carries significant legal implications under both state and federal environmental and public health statutes. The potential establishment of causation between industrial waste disposal practices and childhood leukemia cases may result in:

1. **Civil Liability:** Private party litigation against responsible industrial entities
2. **Regulatory Enforcement:** Environmental violations under state and federal law
3. **Public Health Orders:** Mandatory remediation and health protection measures
4. **Compensation Claims:** Damages for medical expenses, pain and suffering, and wrongful death

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health requires CDC's technical expertise to ensure that epidemiological evidence meets legal standards for causation and damages assessment in potential civil proceedings.

## VI. RESOURCE COMMITMENT AND TIMELINE

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health commits the following resources to support this investigation:

- **Personnel:** Full-time assignment of two epidemiologists and one environmental health specialist
- **Funding:** $75,000 allocated from emergency health investigation funds
- **Facilities:** Laboratory space and administrative support at MDPH headquarters
- **Duration:** 18-month investigation period with quarterly progress reviews

We respectfully request CDC response within 30 days of this submission, with field investigation commencement no later than January 15, 1980.

## VII. CONCLUSION AND URGENCY STATEMENT

The situation in East Woburn represents a potential environmental health disaster with implications extending beyond the immediate affected community. The correlation between industrial chemical contamination and childhood leukemia, if substantiated through rigorous epidemiological investigation, establishes precedent for environmental causation of pediatric malignancies with national significance.

The families affected by this tragedy deserve comprehensive investigation utilizing the highest standards of scientific rigor. The responsible industrial entities must be held accountable for their waste disposal practices and the resulting harm to public health. Only through CDC's specialized expertise can we ensure that justice is served and future environmental health disasters are prevented.

Time is of critical importance in this matter. Additional cases may be developing, environmental evidence may be deteriorating, and affected families require immediate answers regarding the cause of their children's illnesses. We urgently request CDC's full assistance in this investigation.
