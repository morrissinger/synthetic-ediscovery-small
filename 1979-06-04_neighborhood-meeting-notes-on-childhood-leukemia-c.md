## Opening Discussion

Called this meeting after talking with Mary Kane last week about Jimmy and Kevin Jr. We've all been thinking the same thing but nobody wanted to say it out loud. Too many of our children are getting sick with the same thing. Too many for it to be just bad luck.

Started by going around the room and each mother shared what we know:

**My Jimmy** - diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in January 1979. He's only 3 years old. Dr. Najarian at Mass General says his white cell count was extremely high when they found it. Jimmy had been tired for months, getting bruises that wouldn't heal, running fevers. I kept taking him to Dr. Murphy but he said it was just growing pains, then maybe flu. By the time we got the diagnosis, Jimmy was so sick.

**Mary's Kevin Jr.** - diagnosed in 1978, he was 2 years old. Same type of leukemia. Mary said Kevin had the same symptoms - the bruising, the tiredness, the fevers that wouldn't break. He's been in and out of the hospital for treatments. Some days he seems better, other days...

**Donna's Carl** - her boy Carl Robbins III, diagnosed last year at age 4. Same leukemia. Same symptoms we all recognize now.

**Patricia's Michael** - Michael Zona, diagnosed in 1977 when he was just 6. Patricia said she noticed the bruising first, then he stopped wanting to play outside.

**Helen's Patrick** - Patrick Toomey, diagnosed earlier this year, age 7. Helen broke down crying when she talked about how active Patrick used to be before he got sick.

**Margaret's Roland** - Roland Gamache, diagnosed in 1978 at age 6. Margaret said the hardest part is watching him lose weight and energy.

## What We Noticed

All of our children:
- Live in the same general area of East Woburn
- Drink the same city water
- Have the same type of leukemia (acute lymphocytic)
- Started showing symptoms around the same ages (2-7 years old)
- Had similar early symptoms that doctors initially dismissed

**The Water Question**

Mary brought up something that's been bothering her. She said her neighbor mentioned that the city opened new wells a few years back - Wells G and H. Mary thinks they started using water from those wells around 1967 or 1968. That would mean all our children have been drinking that water their whole lives.

Donna said she remembers when they started using the new wells because the water tasted different for a while. More metallic, she thought. But you get used to it.

I asked if anyone noticed anything else about the water - smells, colors, anything unusual. Patricia said sometimes in the morning the water has a chemical smell, but she figured it was just the chlorine they put in to clean it.

## The Companies

We talked about the businesses near where we live. There's that Grace company plant on Washington Street - they make those plastic packaging things. Always trucks going in and out, sometimes with chemical company names on them.

Helen mentioned the old tannery property - the Riley tannery that Beatrice Foods owns now. She said her husband works construction and he's heard stories about what they used to dump behind those old industrial buildings. Chemicals, waste, things that shouldn't go in the ground.

Margaret's husband works at the city, and she said he mentioned that both those companies are upstream from the new wells. If anything was getting into the groundwater from those places, it could end up in our drinking water.

## What the Doctors Are Saying

None of the doctors have connected our cases. Each one treats our child like they're the only case of childhood leukemia they've ever seen. But we're all going to different doctors:

- Jimmy sees Dr. Najarian at Mass General
- Kevin Jr. sees Dr. Weinstein at Children's Hospital
- Carl sees Dr. Morrison at Boston City
- Michael sees Dr. Patterson at Mass General  
- Patrick sees Dr. Chen at Children's Hospital
- Roland sees Dr. Rodriguez at Boston City

When I asked Dr. Najarian if he'd seen other cases like Jimmy's from our area, he said he couldn't discuss other patients. But he did say that childhood leukemia clusters were "extremely rare" and usually meant there was an environmental cause.

## What We Decided

1. **Document everything** - Each of us will write down dates, symptoms, treatments, everything we can remember about our children's illnesses.

2. **Talk to neighbors** - We need to find out if there are other sick children we don't know about. Go door to door if we have to.

3. **Research the water** - Find out more about Wells G and H. When did they start operating? What testing do they do? Who can we ask?

4. **Contact authorities** - Mary suggested calling the Board of Health. Helen thinks we should call the state health department too.

5. **Keep meeting** - We'll meet again next Monday at Mary's house. Bring any information we can find.

## Questions We Need Answered

- How many other children in East Woburn have leukemia?
- When exactly did Wells G and H start providing our water?
- What chemicals do Grace and Beatrice use at their facilities?
- How do they dispose of their waste?
- Has anyone ever tested our drinking water for chemicals besides chlorine?
- Are there other families dealing with this who just haven't connected the dots yet?

## Personal Notes

Walking home after the meeting, I kept thinking about something Dr. Najarian said when Jimmy was first diagnosed. He said acute lymphocytic leukemia in children Jimmy's age was usually caused by exposure to chemicals or radiation. At the time, I couldn't think of anything Jimmy had been exposed to. We don't live near any nuclear plants, no one in our family works with chemicals.

But now I'm wondering about that water. Jimmy has been drinking city water since he was born. We all have. What if there's something in it that's making our children sick?

I also keep thinking about the day Jimmy first got really sick - it was right after he'd been playing outside all morning and came in asking for water. He drank three glasses straight. That night he had a fever that wouldn't break. Was it just coincidence?

Tomorrow I'm going to call the city and ask about Wells G and H. I want to know everything - when they opened, where they draw water from, what testing they do, everything.

If someone's negligence is responsible for what's happening to our children, if companies have been dumping chemicals that are getting into our water and causing these cancers, they need to be held accountable. Our children are suffering - some of them are dying - and we deserve answers.

The pain these children are going through, the fear in their eyes when they have to go for treatments, the way they ask us why they can't play like they used to - if this was preventable, if someone knew chemicals were getting into our water and didn't stop it, that's not just negligence. That's criminal.

**Next meeting:** Monday, June 11, 1979, 7:00 PM at Mary Kane's house
