# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Legal Department - Corporate Counsel Office  
**FROM:** Robert M. Henderson, Environmental Manager  
**DATE:** April 9, 1980  
**RE:** Environmental Consultant Findings - East Woburn Operations

## Summary of Consultant Report

I have received the preliminary environmental assessment report from Geraghty & Miller, Inc. regarding our Cryovac facility at 369 Washington Street in East Woburn. The findings require immediate legal review and strategic planning given the recent municipal well closures and ongoing state health department investigations.

The consultant's soil and groundwater analysis has identified elevated concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE) and other volatile organic compounds in the immediate vicinity of our property. Specifically, TCE levels in monitoring wells installed on the northeastern portion of our site range from 150 to 890 parts per billion, significantly exceeding proposed federal drinking water standards. The consultant notes that groundwater flow patterns in this area generally move in a southwesterly direction toward the Aberjona River valley, which encompasses the area where Wells G and H were previously located.

## Historical Disposal Practices

Our review of facility records from 1964-1979 indicates that standard industrial practices of the era were followed for waste solvent disposal. These practices included on-site disposal of spent solvents and cleaning agents in designated areas of the property, consistent with industry standards and regulatory guidance available at the time. The consultant's report notes evidence of historical disposal activities in the northeastern section of our property, including what appears to be a former disposal lagoon or settling area that was subsequently filled and graded.

## Regulatory and Legal Implications

Given the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's ongoing investigation into the childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn, and the EPA's increased scrutiny of industrial facilities in the Aberjona River watershed, we must carefully consider our response strategy. The consultant emphasizes that while TCE and other solvents were detected on our property, establishing a direct causal link between our operations and the municipal well contamination would require extensive hydrogeological modeling and analysis of multiple potential sources in the area.

I recommend immediate coordination with outside environmental counsel to develop our response to any potential regulatory inquiries. We should also consider proactive remediation measures to demonstrate good corporate citizenship, while ensuring that any actions taken do not constitute an admission of liability for off-site contamination or health impacts.
