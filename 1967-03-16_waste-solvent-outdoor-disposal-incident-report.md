# INCIDENT REPORT

**TO:** Harold J. Peterson, Facility Safety Officer  
**FROM:** Robert F. Mitchell, Maintenance Crew Leader  
**DATE:** March 16, 1967  
**RE:** Waste Solvent Outdoor Disposal Incident - Area 7 Behind Building C

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

On March 15, 1967, at approximately 3:45 PM, I observed maintenance worker Thomas Kowalski disposing of approximately 15 gallons of waste cleaning solvents directly onto the ground surface in Area 7, located approximately 200 feet behind Building C near the eastern property boundary. The waste materials consisted primarily of trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) cleaning solvents used in our packaging equipment maintenance operations, along with smaller quantities of methylene chloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.

When questioned about the disposal method, Kowalski stated that he had been instructed by former supervisor Bill Henderson (who left the company in January) to dispose of waste solvents in this manner "to avoid the paperwork and costs associated with proper disposal." Kowalski indicated this had been his standard practice for waste solvent disposal over the past eight months.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

I immediately instructed Kowalski to cease the disposal activity and secured the remaining waste solvents (approximately 8 gallons) in proper containment drums in the maintenance storage area. I then inspected the disposal area and observed that the ground surface showed obvious signs of repeated chemical application, with dead vegetation in a roughly circular pattern approximately 12 feet in diameter. The soil in this area appeared darker than surrounding areas and had a distinct chemical odor characteristic of chlorinated solvents.

I have temporarily cordoned off the affected area with safety tape and posted warning signs to prevent personnel access. The area is located approximately 150 feet upgradient from the small creek that flows along our eastern property boundary toward the Aberjona River. Given the sandy soil composition in this area, there is concern that the disposed chemicals may have penetrated into the groundwater system.

## ESTIMATED QUANTITIES AND FREQUENCY

Based on my discussion with Kowalski and review of our maintenance solvent usage records, I estimate that approximately 120-150 gallons of waste solvents have been disposed of in this manner since August 1966. The disposal typically occurred 2-3 times per month, with individual disposal events ranging from 8-20 gallons of mixed waste solvents. The primary components of these waste materials include:

- Trichloroethylene (TCE): Approximately 60-70% of total volume
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): Approximately 20-25% of total volume  
- Methylene chloride: Approximately 5-10% of total volume
- 1,1,1-trichloroethane: Approximately 5-10% of total volume
- Various cutting oils and lubricants: Less than 5% of total volume

## CONTRIBUTING FACTORS

Investigation reveals several factors that contributed to this improper disposal practice:

1. **Inadequate Supervision:** Following Bill Henderson's departure in January, there was a gap in direct supervision of maintenance disposal procedures until I assumed full crew leadership responsibilities in February.

2. **Cost Avoidance:** Henderson apparently instructed workers to avoid using the contracted waste disposal service (Industrial Waste Management Corp.) to reduce operational expenses. The contracted disposal service charges $0.45 per gallon for chlorinated solvent disposal.

3. **Lack of Training:** Newer maintenance personnel, including Kowalski who was hired in July 1966, did not receive proper training on waste disposal procedures and environmental regulations.

4. **Inadequate Storage:** Our maintenance storage area lacks sufficient capacity for temporary waste solvent storage, creating pressure to dispose of materials quickly rather than accumulating proper quantities for contracted pickup.

## POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND CONCERNS

The location of this disposal site presents several environmental and regulatory concerns:

**Groundwater Contamination Risk:** The disposal area is situated in sandy soil with high permeability, located upgradient from surface water features. Chlorinated solvents are known to be persistent in groundwater systems and can migrate significant distances from disposal sites.

**Surface Water Impact:** The nearby creek flows toward the Aberjona River and ultimately connects to the broader watershed serving the Woburn area. Any contamination reaching surface water could have downstream impacts.

**Regulatory Compliance:** This disposal practice clearly violates Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations regarding industrial waste disposal, as well as our company's stated environmental policies. We may face regulatory action if this incident is reported to state authorities.

**Worker Safety:** Personnel working in Area 7 may have been exposed to solvent vapors during disposal activities. While no immediate health effects have been reported, long-term exposure to chlorinated solvents poses known health risks.

## RECOMMENDED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

**Immediate (Within 48 Hours):**
1. Conduct soil sampling in the disposal area to determine the extent of contamination
2. Notify company legal counsel regarding potential regulatory reporting requirements
3. Install temporary groundwater monitoring well downgradient from disposal site
4. Document all waste disposal activities for the past 12 months to establish full scope of the problem

**Short-Term (Within 2 Weeks):**
1. Implement mandatory retraining for all maintenance personnel on proper waste disposal procedures
2. Increase contracted waste pickup frequency from monthly to bi-weekly
3. Install additional waste storage capacity in maintenance area
4. Establish written procedures requiring safety officer approval for all waste disposal activities

**Long-Term (Within 60 Days):**
1. Conduct comprehensive environmental assessment of disposal area and surrounding groundwater
2. Evaluate need for soil remediation or containment measures
3. Review and update all environmental compliance procedures
4. Consider installation of permanent groundwater monitoring system

## PERSONNEL ACTIONS

I recommend that Thomas Kowalski receive formal disciplinary action for violating company environmental policies, but note that he was following instructions from his previous supervisor and may not have fully understood the regulatory implications of his actions. All maintenance personnel should receive immediate retraining on waste disposal procedures and environmental regulations.

I also recommend that we review the circumstances surrounding Bill Henderson's departure to determine whether similar improper practices may have been implemented in other areas of our operations.

## CONCLUSION

This incident represents a serious breach of proper environmental practices and creates potential liability for Cryovac Inc. The disposal of chlorinated solvents directly onto the ground surface violates state regulations and company policy, and may have resulted in groundwater contamination. While the full extent of environmental impact is not yet known, immediate action is required to prevent further contamination and to assess the need for remedial measures.

I am available to discuss this matter further and to coordinate the recommended corrective actions. Given the potential regulatory implications, I recommend that this incident be reported to senior management and company legal counsel immediately.
