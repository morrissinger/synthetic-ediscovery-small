**Date:** September 28, 1981  
**Time:** 11:20 AM - 2:45 PM  
**Location:** Law Office of Jan Schlichtmann, 60 State Street, Boston, MA  
**Attendees:**
- Jan Schlichtmann, Attorney (Lead Counsel)
- Dr. Robert Harrison, Environmental Toxicologist, Harvard School of Public Health
- Conway, Legal Assistant

## Purpose of Meeting

To evaluate the scientific evidence linking trichloroethylene (TCE) exposure to childhood leukemia and establish causation framework for wrongful death claims arising from the East Woburn water contamination case. Specific focus on establishing negligence standards for industrial chemical disposal practices and quantifying conscious pain and suffering damages.

## Dr. Harrison's Credentials and Background

Dr. Harrison presented his qualifications, including:
- Ph.D. in Environmental Toxicology, Johns Hopkins University (1968)
- 13 years research experience with EPA carcinogen assessment
- Published author on chlorinated solvent toxicity (47 peer-reviewed papers)
- Previous expert testimony in 12 environmental contamination cases
- Current research on TCE metabolic pathways and DNA damage mechanisms

Dr. Harrison confirmed his availability to serve as expert witness and his familiarity with the Woburn case through EPA preliminary reports.

## TCE Carcinogenic Properties - Scientific Evidence

### Animal Studies and Laboratory Evidence

Dr. Harrison reviewed the current state of scientific knowledge regarding TCE carcinogenicity:

**Key Animal Studies:**
- National Cancer Institute bioassay (1976): Clear evidence of carcinogenicity in mice and rats
- Increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice exposed to 500-1000 ppm TCE
- Lymphoma development in exposed animal populations at concentrations as low as 100 ppm
- Dose-response relationship established across multiple species

**Metabolic Pathway Analysis:**
TCE metabolism produces several potentially carcinogenic metabolites:
- Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) - DNA reactive compound
- Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) - liver carcinogen
- Chloral hydrate - mutagenic properties documented
- These metabolites accumulate in fatty tissues and cross blood-brain barrier

### Human Epidemiological Evidence

Dr. Harrison discussed emerging human studies linking TCE exposure to cancer:

**Occupational Studies:**
- Increased leukemia rates among aircraft manufacturing workers (Boeing study, 1980)
- Liver cancer clusters in dry cleaning industry workers
- Kidney cancer association in metal degreasing operations

**Environmental Exposure Studies:**
- Preliminary data from contaminated groundwater sites showing elevated cancer rates
- Childhood leukemia clusters near industrial facilities using TCE
- **Critical finding:** Children appear more susceptible due to developing immune systems

### Dose-Response Relationship

Dr. Harrison emphasized that **no safe threshold exists** for TCE exposure regarding carcinogenic effects:
- Linear dose-response model most appropriate for legal proceedings
- Wells G and H contamination levels (267-400 ppb TCE) represent **significant cancer risk**
- Estimated excess cancer risk: **1 in 250 to 1 in 400** for lifetime exposure at documented levels
- **Latency period:** 5-15 years typical for leukemia development following exposure

## Causation Analysis - James Anderson Case

### Exposure Timeline Assessment

Dr. Harrison reviewed James Anderson's exposure history:

**Prenatal Exposure (1968):**
- Anne Anderson consumed contaminated water throughout pregnancy
- TCE crosses placental barrier - documented fetal exposure
- Critical organ development period coincides with highest contamination levels

**Early Childhood Exposure (1968-1972):**
- Continuous daily exposure through drinking water, food preparation, bathing
- Estimated daily intake: 15-25 micrograms per kilogram body weight
- **Exceeds EPA cancer risk guidelines by factor of 100-150**

**Leukemia Diagnosis (January 1972):**
- 3.5-year latency period consistent with TCE-induced leukemia
- Acute lymphocytic leukemia type matches animal study findings
- Age at diagnosis (3 years) within expected range for chemical-induced childhood leukemia

### Scientific Causation Opinion

Dr. Harrison stated his professional opinion:

> "Within reasonable scientific certainty, the trichloroethylene contamination of Wells G and H was a substantial contributing factor in the development of James Anderson's acute lymphocytic leukemia. The dose levels, exposure duration, timing, and latency period are all consistent with established toxicological principles for TCE carcinogenesis."

**Causation Factors Supporting This Opinion:**
1. **Timing:** Exposure preceded disease by appropriate latency period
2. **Dose:** Contamination levels exceeded known carcinogenic thresholds
3. **Duration:** Continuous exposure from prenatal through early childhood
4. **Specificity:** Leukemia type consistent with TCE-induced cancers
5. **Biological plausibility:** Established metabolic pathways for carcinogenesis

## Industrial Standard of Care Analysis

### Chemical Industry Knowledge (1960s-1970s)

Dr. Harrison reviewed the timeline of industry knowledge regarding TCE hazards:

**1960s Industry Knowledge:**
- Manufacturing companies aware of acute toxicity effects
- Occupational health studies documented liver and kidney damage
- Industry trade publications discussed proper disposal methods

**1970s Regulatory Environment:**
- EPA formation (1970) established environmental protection standards
- Clean Water Act (1972) regulated discharge to waterways
- **Industry had constructive knowledge of groundwater contamination risks**

### Negligence Standards for Chemical Disposal

Dr. Harrison identified several industry standards that were violated:

**Proper Disposal Practices:**
- Chemical waste should be contained in lined facilities
- Groundwater monitoring required near disposal sites
- Separation distances from municipal water supplies mandated

**Failure to Meet Standards:**
- Direct discharge to unlined lagoons and soil
- No groundwater monitoring systems installed
- Disposal within 1,500 feet of municipal wells
- **These practices fell below accepted industry standards even for the 1960s**

## Conscious Pain and Suffering Assessment

### Medical Impact of TCE-Induced Leukemia

Dr. Harrison reviewed the specific suffering associated with chemical-induced childhood leukemia:

**Physical Suffering:**
- Bone marrow suppression causing severe fatigue and weakness
- Increased susceptibility to infections due to compromised immune system
- Bleeding disorders from low platelet counts
- Nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy treatments

**Psychological Impact:**
- Awareness of serious illness beginning around age 5-6
- Hospital confinement and separation from family
- Physical limitations preventing normal childhood activities
- Fear and anxiety regarding medical procedures

**Duration and Progression:**
James Anderson's 9-year battle (1972-1981) involved:
- Over 200 hospital days
- Approximately 150 medical procedures
- Periods of remission followed by relapse anxiety
- **Conscious awareness of deteriorating condition in final months**

### Quantifying Conscious Pain and Suffering

Dr. Harrison noted that chemical-induced cancers often involve **greater suffering** than naturally occurring cancers due to:
- Earlier age of onset
- More aggressive disease progression
- Additional psychological trauma from "preventable" nature of exposure
- Family knowledge that illness was environmentally caused

**Expert Opinion:** The conscious pain and suffering in this case was **substantially enhanced** by the preventable nature of the TCE exposure and the prolonged disease course.

## Recommendations for Legal Proceedings

### Expert Testimony Strategy

Dr. Harrison outlined his proposed testimony approach:

1. **Establish TCE carcinogenicity** through comprehensive review of scientific literature
2. **Demonstrate causation** using Bradford Hill criteria for environmental causation
3. **Quantify exposure levels** and compare to established risk thresholds
4. **Address industry knowledge** and standard of care violations
5. **Describe enhanced suffering** due to chemical etiology

### Additional Expert Support Needed

Dr. Harrison recommended consulting with:
- Pediatric oncologist
