# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Legal Team  
**FROM:** Jan Schlichtmann  
**DATE:** January 28, 1982  
**RE:** Legal Team Expansion - Joseph Mulligan Assignment

Team,

Following the tragic death of James Anderson on January 18, 1981, and our subsequent investigation into the contamination of Wells G and H in East Woburn, I am pleased to announce that Joseph Mulligan will be joining our legal team effective February 1, 1982. Joe brings extensive experience in environmental law and toxic tort litigation that will be invaluable as we prepare to take on what promises to be one of the most complex cases of industrial contamination this firm has ever handled.

As you are all aware, the Anderson case has evolved far beyond a single wrongful death claim. Our preliminary investigation has revealed a pattern of childhood leukemia cases in the Pine Street and East Woburn neighborhoods that appears directly linked to the contamination of the municipal water supply. The victims include not only James Anderson, but also Kevin Kane Jr., Michael Zona, Patrick Toomey, Carl Robbins III, and Roland Gamache. Each of these families has been devastated by this preventable tragedy, and each deserves our full commitment to uncovering the truth about how industrial solvents found their way into drinking water that served hundreds of families.

Joe's assignment will focus primarily on the technical and regulatory aspects of our case against W.R. Grace Company, Cryovac Inc., Beatrice Foods, and John J. Riley Company. His background in environmental science will be crucial as we work to establish the chain of contamination from these defendants' facilities to Wells G and H. We have already documented trichloroethylene concentrations as high as 400 parts per billion in the well water—levels that are unconscionably dangerous and represent a clear violation of any reasonable standard of corporate responsibility. Joe will coordinate with the EPA and Massachusetts Department of Public Health to ensure we have access to all relevant testing data and regulatory findings.

I want to emphasize to everyone on this team that we are not just pursuing a legal victory—we are fighting for justice for families like the Andersons, who trusted that their municipal water supply was safe for their children. Anne Anderson gave her son James water from the tap for his entire twelve-year life, never knowing that every glass contained carcinogenic chemicals that would ultimately take his life. This case will require all of our skills, dedication, and resources, but I am confident that with Joe's addition to our team, we will be able to hold these corporations accountable for the harm they have caused to this community.

Please join me in welcoming Joe to the firm. We will be scheduling a comprehensive case review meeting for next week to ensure everyone is fully briefed on the current status of our investigation and litigation strategy.

Jan
