# ANNUAL MAINTENANCE BUDGET REQUEST
## FISCAL YEAR 1970 CRYOVAC FACILITY

**TO:** Cryovac Finance Department  
**FROM:** Thomas Henderson, Facilities Manager  
**DATE:** January 20, 1970  
**RE:** Annual Maintenance Budget Request - Fiscal Year 1970

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the annual maintenance budget request for the Cryovac Inc. manufacturing facility located in Woburn, Massachusetts for fiscal year 1970. The requested budget totals $247,500, representing a 12% increase over the previous fiscal year allocation of $221,000. This increase is necessary to address critical infrastructure maintenance, equipment upgrades, and regulatory compliance requirements that have emerged during the 1969 operational year.

The facility continues to operate at full capacity producing plastic packaging materials and related chemical products. Our production output has increased 18% year-over-year, necessitating additional maintenance resources to ensure continued operational efficiency and safety compliance.

## FACILITY OVERVIEW

The Cryovac facility encompasses 185,000 square feet of manufacturing space on a 47-acre site in East Woburn. Primary operations include plastic film extrusion, chemical coating processes, and packaging material finishing. The facility employs 312 full-time workers across three shifts and produces approximately 2.8 million pounds of finished product annually.

Key facility systems requiring regular maintenance include:
- Chemical processing equipment and storage systems
- Industrial heating and cooling systems
- Electrical distribution and control systems
- Water treatment and waste management systems
- Building infrastructure and safety systems

## CRITICAL MAINTENANCE PRIORITIES

### **Chemical Storage and Handling Systems**

The chemical storage areas require immediate attention to ensure continued safe operations. Several storage tanks have shown signs of corrosion and require recoating or replacement. The chemical transfer systems, including pumps and piping used for trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and other solvents, require comprehensive inspection and maintenance to prevent leaks or system failures.

**Budget Allocation:** $22,400

### **Waste Disposal Infrastructure**

The facility's waste management systems require upgrades to handle increased production volumes. This includes maintenance of the chemical waste storage areas, improvement of containment systems, and regular inspection of disposal pathways. Proper maintenance of these systems is essential for environmental compliance and operational safety.

**Budget Allocation:** $16,800

### **Production Line Efficiency**

To maintain our competitive position and meet customer delivery requirements, production equipment must operate at optimal efficiency. Scheduled maintenance programs for extrusion lines and chemical processing equipment are critical to preventing unplanned downtime and ensuring product quality standards.

**Budget Allocation:** $85,800

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

Recent discussions with state environmental officials have emphasized the importance of maintaining robust environmental management systems. The maintenance budget includes provisions for ensuring all waste handling and disposal systems meet current regulatory standards. This includes regular inspection and maintenance of chemical storage areas, waste treatment systems, and monitoring equipment.

The facility maintains all required permits and licenses, and the proposed maintenance budget ensures continued compliance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations and other applicable standards.

## COST JUSTIFICATION

The requested 12% budget increase is justified by several factors:

1. **Increased Production Volume:** Higher throughput requires more frequent maintenance cycles
2. **Equipment Age:** Several critical systems are approaching end-of-life and require more intensive maintenance
3. **Regulatory Requirements:** Enhanced environmental compliance standards require additional system maintenance
4. **Safety Improvements:** Investment in safety system maintenance reduces liability exposure
5. **Preventive Approach:** Proactive maintenance reduces costly emergency repairs and production disruptions

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

Implementation of this maintenance budget will achieve:

- 99.2% equipment uptime target
- Zero safety incidents related to equipment failure
- Full regulatory compliance across all systems
- Extended equipment life cycles
- Reduced emergency repair costs
- Improved product quality consistency

## RECOMMENDATIONS

I recommend approval of the full $247,500 maintenance budget request for fiscal year 1970. This investment is essential for maintaining safe, efficient, and compliant operations at the Woburn facility. Deferring maintenance activities would result in higher costs, increased safety risks, and potential regulatory issues.

The maintenance schedule has been coordinated with production planning to minimize operational disruptions. All major maintenance activities are planned during scheduled downtime periods or can be performed while maintaining reduced production capacity.

**Respectfully submitted,**

Thomas Henderson
