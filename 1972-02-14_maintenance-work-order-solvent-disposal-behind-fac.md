### WORK DESCRIPTION

**Location:** Behind main facility building, eastern perimeter near loading dock area

**Task:** Disposal of accumulated solvent waste containers

The maintenance crew is directed to remove and dispose of the following materials that have accumulated in the storage area behind the main facility:

- Approximately 15-20 drums of used TCE (trichloroethylene) cleaning solvent
- 8-10 containers of degreasing solution residue
- Various smaller containers of mixed cleaning chemicals from production line maintenance

**Disposal Instructions:**

1. Load all containers onto flatbed truck for transport
2. Empty drum contents into the designated disposal area located approximately 200 yards northeast of the main building, near the tree line
3. Pour contents directly onto the ground in the established disposal zone
4. Rinse empty containers with water hose and allow rinse water to drain into the same area
5. Stack empty drums in the storage shed for potential reuse

**Safety Precautions:**

- Wear work gloves when handling containers
- Avoid prolonged inhalation of vapors during disposal process
- Complete work during daylight hours for visibility
- Ensure disposal area is clear of personnel during operation

### BACKGROUND

This disposal operation addresses the monthly accumulation of waste solvents from our film packaging production lines. The TCE and degreasing solutions are byproducts of our normal cleaning and maintenance procedures required to maintain equipment performance and product quality standards. The current inventory of waste containers has reached capacity in our temporary storage area and requires immediate removal to maintain operational efficiency.

The designated disposal area has been used for similar purposes over the past several years and provides adequate drainage away from facility operations. This location was selected due to its distance from the main building and its natural grade which allows for proper runoff management.

### COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Personnel Required:** 3-4 crew members  
**Equipment Needed:** Flatbed truck, dolly, water hose  

**Completion Verification:**
- All containers removed from storage area
- Disposal area properly utilized
- Equipment cleaned and returned
- Empty drums stored as directed

**Report Completion To:** Frank Morrison, Plant Supervisor (Extension 247)

Upon completion of this work order, the crew supervisor should provide verbal confirmation that all materials have been properly disposed of according to these instructions. Any issues or complications encountered during the disposal process should be reported immediately.

This work order supports our ongoing facility maintenance program and ensures continued compliance with our operational procedures. The timely completion of this task is essential for maintaining adequate storage capacity for future waste accumulation.
