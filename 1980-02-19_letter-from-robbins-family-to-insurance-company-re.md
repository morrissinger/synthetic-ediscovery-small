# Letter to Blue Cross Blue Shield

February 19, 1980

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts  
100 Summer Street  
Boston, MA 02110

Dear Claims Review Department:

I am writing to you regarding the mounting medical expenses for our son, Carl Robbins III, and to request immediate review of our claim denials. As policy holders under Group Plan #BC-4429-WOB through my husband's employer, we have faithfully paid our premiums for over eight years, believing that our family would be protected in times of medical crisis. That crisis has now arrived, and we find ourselves fighting not only for our child's life but also for the insurance coverage we have paid for and desperately need.

Carl was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in September 1979 at the age of four years old. What began as fatigue and recurring fevers quickly escalated into a nightmare of hospital stays, chemotherapy treatments, and specialist consultations. The initial diagnosis at Massachusetts General Hospital resulted in immediate hospitalization and the beginning of an intensive treatment protocol that continues today. Dr. Patricia Morrison, Carl's oncologist, has indicated that his treatment will require at least two years of continuous chemotherapy, with the possibility of bone marrow transplantation if his condition does not respond adequately to current protocols.

The financial burden has become overwhelming. Between September 1979 and January 1980, Carl's medical expenses have exceeded $18,000, with monthly costs now averaging $3,200. This includes hospital stays totaling 47 days at $285 per day, chemotherapy medications costing $420 per treatment cycle, weekly blood work and monitoring at $85 per visit, and specialist consultations averaging $125 each. Your company has approved some routine expenses but has denied coverage for what you term "experimental treatments," including the specialized chemotherapy protocol Dr. Morrison prescribed and the nutritional support therapy recommended by the pediatric oncology team.

We are not asking for charity or special consideration—we are asking for the coverage we have paid for and that our son desperately needs. Carl is one of several children in our East Woburn neighborhood who have been diagnosed with leukemia in recent months. The other families—the Andersons, the Kanes, the Zonas, and the Toomeys—are facing similar medical crises and similar insurance battles. There appears to be something terribly wrong in our community, and our children are paying the price with their health and their lives.

The recent closure of municipal Wells G and H has raised serious questions about what our families have been exposed to through our drinking water. While investigations continue, our children cannot wait for answers. They need treatment now, and we need our insurance company to honor its commitments. The stress of fighting insurance denials while caring for a critically ill child is beyond what any family should have to endure.

I am enclosing copies of all medical records, treatment protocols, and physician recommendations that support the necessity of Carl's care. Dr. Morrison has indicated her willingness to speak directly with your medical review staff to explain the treatment approach and its importance for Carl's survival. We are also prepared to seek independent medical review if necessary to establish the appropriateness of his care.

We request that you immediately reverse the denials for Carl's specialized chemotherapy treatments, approve coverage for his ongoing nutritional support therapy, and establish a streamlined approval process for future treatments in his protocol. Time is critical in childhood leukemia treatment, and delays in care due to insurance disputes could have devastating consequences for our son's prognosis.

My husband works two jobs to support our family and maintain our insurance coverage. I have had to leave my position at the Woburn Public Library to care for Carl full-time. We are doing everything within our power to provide for our son's needs, but we cannot do it alone. We need Blue Cross Blue Shield to be our partner in this fight, not another obstacle to overcome.

Please contact me at 617-933-8247 to discuss immediate resolution of these claims. Carl's next treatment cycle is scheduled for February 28th, and we need confirmation of coverage before that date. Our family has been through enough uncertainty—we should not have to worry about whether our insurance company will abandon us in our greatest time of need.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and to working together to ensure Carl receives the medical care that may save his life.

Sincerely,

Margaret Robbins
