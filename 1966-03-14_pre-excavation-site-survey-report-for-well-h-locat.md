## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Municipal Engineering Department has completed a comprehensive pre-excavation site survey for the proposed Well H location in East Woburn. The selected site, located approximately 600 feet northeast of the existing Well G facility on municipal property adjacent to the Aberjona River, presents favorable geological and hydrological conditions for water supply development. This report details our findings regarding site suitability, subsurface conditions, access requirements, and construction recommendations for the proposed well installation.

## SITE DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The proposed Well H site is situated on a 2.3-acre parcel of city-owned land at coordinates 42°29'18"N, 71°09'42"W, approximately 0.6 miles southeast of the intersection of Main Street (Route 38) and Mishawum Road. The site lies within the East Woburn watershed area, positioned on relatively flat terrain at an elevation of 34 feet above mean sea level. The property is bounded to the west by the Aberjona River (approximately 150 feet distant), to the north by undeveloped municipal land, to the east by residential properties along Salem Street, and to the south by light industrial facilities.

Current site conditions include mixed vegetation consisting of native grasses, scattered oak and maple trees, and areas of wetland vegetation near the river boundary. Surface drainage patterns indicate natural flow toward the Aberjona River, with no evidence of standing water or drainage problems during our survey period. The site is accessible via an existing gravel service road that connects to Salem Street, requiring minimal additional roadwork for construction access.

## GEOLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT

### Subsurface Conditions

Test boring operations conducted on March 10-11, 1966, revealed the following subsurface profile:

- **0-3 feet:** Topsoil and organic matter, dark brown silty loam with root systems
- **3-12 feet:** Fine to medium sand with trace silt, light brown to tan coloration
- **12-28 feet:** Medium to coarse sand and gravel, well-sorted glacial outwash deposits
- **28-45 feet:** Coarse sand and gravel with cobbles, high permeability
- **45-68 feet:** Fine to medium sand with clay lenses, variable permeability
- **68-85 feet:** Dense sand and gravel overlying bedrock contact

Bedrock was encountered at 85 feet depth, consisting of weathered granite and schist typical of the regional geology. The presence of substantial sand and gravel deposits between 12-68 feet indicates excellent potential for groundwater development, with estimated sustainable yield capacity of 400-500 gallons per minute based on preliminary permeability calculations.

### Groundwater Characteristics

Static water level measurements taken during the survey period indicated groundwater at approximately 8-10 feet below surface grade, consistent with seasonal variations and proximity to the Aberjona River. Groundwater flow direction appears to be generally southwestward toward the river, following the natural topographic gradient. The aquifer appears to be unconfined in the upper portions, transitioning to semi-confined conditions at greater depths where clay lenses are present.

Water quality samples collected from test borings showed clear, odorless water with preliminary field testing indicating acceptable pH (6.8-7.2) and low turbidity. Complete laboratory analysis has been requested through the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory services, with results expected within 10-14 days.

## SITE ACCESS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

The proposed well site offers excellent access for construction and maintenance operations. The existing gravel service road provides adequate load-bearing capacity for drilling equipment and materials transport. Electrical service is available from existing overhead lines along Salem Street, requiring approximately 300 feet of new service line installation.

Proximity to existing Well G facilities (600 feet distance) allows for potential integration with current pumping and distribution infrastructure, though separate control systems are recommended for operational flexibility. The site location provides adequate buffer distance from residential properties (minimum 200 feet) while remaining within the optimal aquifer zone identified in our 1964 hydrogeological study.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The survey identified no significant environmental constraints that would preclude well development at this location. The site lies outside designated wetland boundaries as defined by state regulations, though the proximity to the Aberjona River requires careful attention to construction practices to prevent erosion or sedimentation.

Surrounding land uses include residential development to the east and northeast, with light industrial facilities to the south including manufacturing operations along the river corridor. These existing land uses are consistent with municipal water supply development and present no apparent conflicts with proposed well operations.

## CONSTRUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on survey findings, we recommend the following specifications for Well H construction:

### Well Design
- **Total Depth:** 90-95 feet to ensure adequate penetration into productive aquifer zones
- **Casing Diameter:** 12-inch steel casing to 30 feet depth, 8-inch casing to total depth
- **Screen Installation:** 20 feet of stainless steel well screen in the 45-65 foot interval
- **Gravel Pack:** Clean, graded gravel pack extending 5 feet above screen top
- **Sanitary Seal:** Bentonite clay seal from surface to 25 feet depth

### Site Preparation
- Clearing and grading of 100-foot by 100-foot work area
- Installation of temporary construction access road improvements
- Establishment of sediment control measures during construction
- Coordination with municipal utilities for service installations

### Testing Requirements
- 72-hour pump test upon completion to determine sustainable yield
- Complete water quality analysis including bacteriological testing
- Static and pumping water level measurements
- Aquifer interference testing with existing Well G

## ESTIMATED COSTS AND SCHEDULE

Preliminary cost estimates for Well H development are as follows:

- **Site Preparation:** $2,800
- **Well Drilling and Installation:** $18,500
- **Pump and Motor Equipment:** $6,200
- **Electrical and Control Systems:** $4,100
- **Site Restoration and Landscaping:** $1,200
- **Testing and Commissioning:** $2,400
- **Engineering and Inspection:** $3,800

**Total Estimated Cost:** $39,000

Construction schedule estimates indicate 6-8 weeks for completion from project authorization, weather permitting. Optimal timing would be late spring through early fall to minimize weather-related delays and allow adequate time for testing and commissioning before winter operations.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

The proposed Well H installation will require the following permits and approvals:

- Massachusetts Department of Public Health water supply permit
- Local building permit for pump house construction
- Soil disturbance permit from municipal conservation commission
- Coordination with state environmental agencies regarding proximity to Aberjona River

All regulatory requirements appear straightforward given the municipal nature of the project and consistency with existing water supply operations. We recommend initiating permit applications immediately upon project approval to minimize schedule delays.

## CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The proposed Well H site presents excellent conditions for municipal water supply development. Geological and hydrological conditions are favorable for sustainable groundwater production, with estimated capacity sufficient to meet projected demand growth in the East Woburn service area. Site access and infrastructure requirements are manageable within reasonable cost parameters.

We recommend proceeding with project authorization and detailed design development. The addition of Well H to the municipal water system will provide important supply redundancy and capacity expansion to serve the growing East Woburn community. Construction should be scheduled for the 1966 construction season to ensure completion before winter conditions.

This survey was conducted in accordance with standard municipal engineering practices and Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines for public water supply development. All recommendations are based on current regulatory requirements and accepted industry standards for municipal well construction.
