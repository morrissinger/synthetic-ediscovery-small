## SITE CONDITIONS AND OBSERVATIONS

### NOVEMBER 1-7
Weather conditions dry, site accessible by truck. Chrome liquor disposal proceeding normally. Some surface pooling observed in central pit area. Lime application maintaining adequate odor control.

### NOVEMBER 8-14
Light rainfall beginning November 10. Standing water developing in eastern sections. TCE disposal continuing in southeastern evaporation pit. Strong chemical odors noted during morning hours, dissipating by afternoon.

### NOVEMBER 15-21
Heavy rainfall November 16-18. Significant standing water throughout disposal area. Surface runoff observed flowing toward seasonal creek bed. Disposal operations continued with increased lime and sawdust covering.

### NOVEMBER 22-30
Site conditions improving with drier weather. Water levels receding but soil saturation remains high. Some seepage noted at eastern boundary near wetland area. Increased sawdust application to control surface conditions.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE NOTES

**State Requirements:** Current disposal practices conform to Massachusetts industrial waste regulations as understood by facility management. No specific permits required for current disposal methods under existing state guidelines.

**Federal Oversight:** No federal regulations currently applicable to tannery waste disposal operations. Monitoring limited to basic safety protocols for worker protection.

**Local Ordinances:** East Woburn municipal ordinances do not specifically address industrial chemical disposal. Property zoned for industrial use permits current waste management practices.

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE PLANNING

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED
1. Increase lime application during wet weather periods
2. Improve access road drainage for consistent truck access
3. Monitor eastern boundary seepage during spring thaw period
4. Consider additional sawdust suppliers for adequate covering material

### LONG-TERM CONSIDERATIONS
1. Evaluate expansion of disposal area to accommodate increased production
2. Assess feasibility of on-site chemical recovery for chrome liquors
3. Monitor regulatory developments that may affect disposal practices
4. Consider alternative disposal sites if current area reaches capacity

### COST ANALYSIS
- Monthly disposal costs: $340 (labor, materials, transportation)
- Alternative commercial disposal estimate: $2,800-3,400 monthly
- Current method represents 88% cost savings versus commercial alternatives
