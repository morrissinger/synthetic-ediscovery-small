# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Legal Team  
**FROM:** Jan Schlichtmann  
**DATE:** February 24, 1982  
**RE:** Internal Case Review - Medical Records Analysis for Anderson v. Grace et al.

## Medical Documentation Review Summary

I have completed my preliminary review of the medical records for James Anderson and the other affected children in our Woburn case. The documentation presents compelling evidence that strengthens our negligence claims against W.R. Grace Company, Beatrice Foods, and the other defendants, particularly regarding causation and damages.

**James Anderson Medical History:**
The medical records for James Anderson (DOB: July 16, 1968; DOD: January 18, 1981) establish a clear timeline of acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosis in January 1972 at age three. The Children's Hospital records show consistent treatment protocols over nine years, with detailed documentation of chemotherapy regimens, hospitalizations, and progressive deterioration. Most significantly, the records confirm James lived his entire life at 11 Orange Street, receiving municipal water from Wells G and H throughout his prenatal development and childhood years. His mother Anne Anderson's prenatal records also document her residence at the same address and consumption of municipal water during pregnancy.

**Pattern Analysis Across Affected Children:**
The medical records for Kevin Kane Jr., Michael Zona, Patrick Toomey, Carl Robbins III, and Roland Gamache demonstrate a statistically anomalous cluster of childhood leukemia diagnoses between 1969 and 1979. All families resided within the Wells G and H service area during critical exposure periods. Hospital records from Massachusetts General, Children's Hospital, and other treating facilities show remarkably similar presentations of acute lymphocytic leukemia, with onset ages ranging from 2 to 8 years old. The temporal correlation between well operation (G opened 1964, H opened 1966) and subsequent diagnoses supports our causation theory.

**Damages Documentation:**
Medical expenses documented in hospital billing records, insurance claims, and family financial statements demonstrate substantial economic damages. The Anderson family alone incurred over $47,000 in medical costs during James's nine-year treatment period. Pain and suffering damages are extensively documented through physician notes describing treatment side effects, quality of life impacts, and family psychological assessments. The wrongful death claim for James Anderson is supported by comprehensive medical records establishing the direct causal relationship between leukemia and death, with no intervening causes noted in the death certificate or autopsy findings.

**Recommendations for Litigation Strategy:**
These medical records provide the foundation for establishing both factual and proximate causation under Massachusetts negligence law. The defendants' disposal of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene created a foreseeable risk of harm to municipal water users. The concentration levels documented by EPA testing (TCE at 400 ppb, PCE at 43 ppb) combined with the medical evidence of childhood leukemia cases creates a compelling narrative of corporate responsibility for these tragic outcomes.

I recommend we engage Dr. David Ozonoff from Boston University School of Public Health to provide expert testimony linking the chemical contamination to the observed health effects. His epidemiological analysis will be crucial for establishing causation to the legal standard required in Massachusetts courts.
