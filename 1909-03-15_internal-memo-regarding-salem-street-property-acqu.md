# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Riley Company Board of Directors  
**FROM:** John J. Riley, President  
**DATE:** March 15, 1909  
**RE:** Salem Street Property Acquisition and Tannery Development Plans

Gentlemen,

I am pleased to report that negotiations for the acquisition of the Salem Street property in East Woburn have concluded successfully. The parcel at 228 Salem Street, comprising approximately 4.2 acres of industrial land, has been secured for the establishment of our new tannery operation. The purchase price of $3,200 represents excellent value for a property of this size and strategic positioning within Woburn's established manufacturing district.

The selected site offers several compelling advantages for our leather processing enterprise. The property benefits from direct proximity to the Aberjona River along its eastern boundary, providing essential water access for our tanning operations. The Boston & Maine Railroad tracks form the western property line, ensuring convenient freight access for both incoming raw materials and outbound finished leather goods. This transportation infrastructure will prove invaluable as we establish supply relationships with hide dealers throughout New England and develop markets for our processed leather products in Boston and surrounding metropolitan areas.

Our preliminary site survey confirms the property's suitability for industrial development. The terrain is relatively level and well-drained, requiring minimal grading for construction of our tanning sheds and processing facilities. The soil composition appears favorable for foundation work, and the existing drainage patterns will accommodate the wastewater discharge requirements inherent to leather processing operations. I have consulted with contractor Thomas McKenna regarding construction timelines, and he estimates completion of our primary facilities within six months of groundbreaking, weather permitting.

The Board should be aware that this location positions us strategically within East Woburn's growing industrial corridor. Several manufacturing concerns have established operations in the immediate vicinity, creating a favorable business environment and shared infrastructure benefits. The proximity to established transportation networks and the availability of local labor from Woburn's working population will support our operational efficiency and cost management objectives. I am confident this acquisition represents a sound foundation for the long-term growth and profitability of Riley Company's leather manufacturing division.

I recommend the Board formally approve this acquisition at our next quarterly meeting and authorize the immediate commencement of construction activities. Time is of the essence if we are to capitalize on favorable spring weather conditions and achieve our goal of beginning tannery operations before the end of 1909.

Respectfully submitted,

**John J. Riley**  
President, John J. Riley Company
