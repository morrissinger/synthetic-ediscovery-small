# DRAFT PLEADING - NUISANCE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CLAIMS

**CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT**

**TO:** Jan Schlichtmann, Esq.  
**FROM:** Joseph Mulligan, Esq.  
**DATE:** January 28, 1982  
**RE:** Anderson v. W.R. Grace et al. - Draft Nuisance Claims and Injunctive Relief

---

## I. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF NUISANCE CLAIMS

Based on our investigation into the groundwater contamination affecting Wells G and H in East Woburn, I have prepared the following draft claims for nuisance and injunctive relief. These claims should be included as separate counts in our complaint against W.R. Grace Company, Beatrice Foods Company, and other identified defendants.

### A. Legal Framework - Private Nuisance

Under Massachusetts General Laws and established case precedent, a private nuisance exists where a defendant's conduct substantially and unreasonably interferes with another's use and enjoyment of land. The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 822 defines private nuisance as a nontrespassory invasion of another's interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.

**Elements to Establish:**
1. Substantial interference with use and enjoyment
2. Unreasonable character of the interference
3. Intentional or negligent conduct by defendants
4. Causation between defendants' activities and the interference

### B. Public Nuisance Theory

Massachusetts recognizes public nuisance claims where defendant's conduct unreasonably interferes with a right common to the general public. The contamination of municipal Wells G and H affects the entire East Woburn community served by these water sources, establishing grounds for public nuisance claims.

**Key Considerations:**
- Municipal water supply serves public interest
- Widespread community impact beyond individual plaintiffs
- Special injury requirement for private parties bringing public nuisance claims

## II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS SUPPORTING NUISANCE CLAIMS

### A. Defendants' Industrial Activities

**W.R. Grace Company - Cryovac Division:**
- Operated manufacturing facility at 201 Montvale Avenue since 1954
- Used trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) as industrial solvents
- Disposed of chemical wastes on-site through various methods including:
  - Direct discharge to unlined lagoons
  - Burial in drums and containers
  - Surface spreading of liquid wastes
  - Discharge to storm drains and surface waters

**Beatrice Foods Company:**
- Operated tanning and leather processing facility
- Used chlorinated solvents in degreasing operations
- Maintained waste disposal areas on property
- Allowed chemicals to percolate into groundwater

### B. Contamination of Water Supply

**Wells G and H Operation:**
- Well G opened May 1964, capacity 400 gallons per minute
- Well H opened October 1966, capacity 330 gallons per minute
- Combined wells served approximately 5,000 East Woburn residents
- Located within groundwater flow path from defendant facilities

**Documented Contamination Levels:**
- Trichloroethylene detected at concentrations up to 400 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene detected at concentrations up to 43 parts per billion
- Contamination levels exceed federal safe drinking water standards
- EPA safe level for TCE: 2.7 parts per billion (cancer risk basis)

### C. Interference with Use and Enjoyment

**Substantial Interference:**
The contamination has rendered the municipal water supply unsafe for its intended uses, including:
- Drinking water consumption
- Food preparation and cooking
- Personal hygiene and bathing
- Household cleaning and maintenance
- Agricultural and gardening uses

**Unreasonable Character:**
The interference is unreasonable considering:
- Severity of health risks posed by carcinogenic chemicals
- Duration of contamination (estimated 1964-1979)
- Number of persons affected (entire East Woburn community)
- Availability of alternative disposal methods
- Social utility of defendants' conduct versus harm caused

## III. SPECIFIC NUISANCE CLAIMS

### COUNT I - PRIVATE NUISANCE

**Against All Defendants:**

Defendants, individually and collectively, have created and maintained a private nuisance by contaminating the groundwater supply serving plaintiffs' properties. The presence of carcinogenic chemicals in concentrations far exceeding safe levels constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of their real property.

**Specific Allegations:**
1. Defendants' disposal of industrial chemicals has migrated through groundwater to Wells G and H
2. Contaminated water supply serves plaintiffs' residences at 11 Orange Street and other affected properties
3. Plaintiffs have been deprived of safe, potable water for domestic use
4. Property values have been diminished due to contamination
5. Plaintiffs have incurred expenses for alternative water sources and medical monitoring

### COUNT II - PUBLIC NUISANCE

**Against All Defendants:**

Defendants have created and maintained a public nuisance by contaminating the municipal water supply serving the East Woburn community. The contamination affects a right common to the general public - access to safe drinking water through the municipal system.

**Special Injury Allegations:**
Plaintiffs have suffered special injury distinct from that suffered by the general public through:
- Direct exposure to contaminated water in their homes
- Development of childhood leukemia in family members
- Ongoing health monitoring and medical expenses
- Loss of property value and use

### COUNT III - CONTINUING NUISANCE

**Against All Defendants:**

The contamination constitutes a continuing nuisance that persists despite closure of Wells G and H in December 1979. Defendants' past disposal practices have created ongoing groundwater contamination that continues to migrate and pose environmental and health risks.

## IV. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SOUGHT

### A. Mandatory Injunction

**Cleanup and Remediation:**
1. Complete investigation and mapping of groundwater contamination plume
2. Installation of monitoring wells to track contamination migration
3. Implementation of groundwater remediation system
4. Removal or treatment of contaminated soil and groundwater
5. Restoration of affected aquifer to pre-contamination condition

**Alternative Water Supply:**
1. Provision of safe alternative water supply to affected residents
2. Installation of water treatment systems in affected homes
3. Regular water quality testing and monitoring
4. Medical monitoring program for exposed individuals

### B. Prohibitory Injunction

**Prevention of Future Contamination:**
1. Prohibition of further chemical disposal on defendants' properties
2. Implementation of proper waste management procedures
3. Regular environmental monitoring and reporting
4. Compliance with all applicable environmental regulations

## V. DAMAGES AND RELIEF

### A. Compensatory Damages

**Property Damages:**
- Diminution in property values due to contamination
- Cost of alternative water supply arrangements
- Property remediation and cleanup costs
- Loss of use and enjoyment of property

**Personal Injury Damages:**
- Medical expenses for treatment of leukemia and related conditions
- Pain and suffering of affected children and families
- Loss of consortium and family relationships
- Future medical monitoring and care costs

### B. Punitive Damages

Given the defendants' knowledge of the hazardous nature of the chemicals and their continued disposal practices despite available alternatives, punitive damages may be warranted to deter similar conduct and punish defendants for their reckless disregard of public health and safety.

## VI. RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS

1. **Expert Witness Development:** Retain hydrogeology expert to establish groundwater flow patterns and contamination migration pathways from defendant facilities to Wells G and H.

2. **Medical Causation:** Develop medical expert testimony linking TCE/PCE exposure to childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn.

3. **Economic Analysis:** Retain real estate appraiser and economist to quantify property damage and economic losses.

4. **Discovery Strategy:** Focus initial document requests on defendants' waste disposal practices, knowledge of contamination, and internal communications regarding environmental compliance.

5. **Regulatory Coordination:** Monitor EPA investigation and coordinate with state environmental agencies to support cleanup efforts.

The nuisance claims provide a strong foundation for establishing defendants' liability and obtaining both monetary damages and injunctive relief for the East Woburn community. These
