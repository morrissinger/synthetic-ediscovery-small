# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** All Shift Supervisors - Cryovac Production Staff  
**FROM:** Robert Chen, Production Manager  
**DATE:** July 14, 1969  
**RE:** Updated Procedures for Solvent Waste Disposal Operations

This memo serves to clarify and standardize our current practices regarding the disposal of industrial solvents and chemical waste materials generated during our packaging film production processes. All shift supervisors are required to implement these procedures immediately and ensure compliance among production floor personnel.

## Current Disposal Methods

**Trichloroethylene (TCE) and Related Cleaning Solvents:** All spent TCE from equipment cleaning operations should continue to be collected in the designated 55-gallon drums located at the rear of Building 2. When drums reach approximately 80% capacity, they are to be transported to the disposal area behind the facility. The current practice of allowing evaporation from open containers in the rear yard has proven effective in reducing volume and should be continued. Any remaining liquid residue may be discharged into the drainage system that connects to the rear property line.

**Perchloroethylene (PCE) Waste:** PCE waste from our dry cleaning operations for production equipment should follow similar protocols. Drums containing PCE waste should be stored in the same rear yard area. During summer months, when evaporation rates are higher, supervisors may authorize the spreading of small quantities of PCE waste on the gravel areas to accelerate disposal through natural processes.

## Safety Considerations

While these solvents are industrial-grade chemicals, they pose minimal risk when handled according to standard industrial practices. Ensure that workers wear appropriate gloves when handling containers and maintain adequate ventilation in enclosed areas. The rear disposal area provides sufficient distance from residential properties to prevent any potential concerns from neighboring areas.

## Documentation Requirements

Maintain basic records of drum quantities and disposal dates for internal tracking purposes. No external reporting is currently required for these materials under existing regulations. Should any questions arise from municipal authorities regarding our disposal practices, refer all inquiries to the main office for appropriate response.

These procedures have been reviewed with plant management and are consistent with standard industry practices for facilities of our size and production capacity. The location of our facility provides natural drainage patterns that effectively manage any residual materials, and our current methods represent the most cost-effective approach for handling these routine waste streams.

All shift supervisors should ensure their teams understand these protocols and maintain consistency across all production shifts. Any deviations from these established procedures must be approved in advance by plant management.
