# FIELD INVESTIGATION STATUS REPORT
## WOBURN GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION

**TO:** Thomas P. Henderson, Regional Director, EPA Region I  
**FROM:** Robert J. Mitchell, Field Team Leader  
**DATE:** March 13, 1980  
**RE:** Status of Field Investigation - Wells G and H Contamination, Woburn, Massachusetts

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report provides a comprehensive status update on the ongoing field investigation of groundwater contamination affecting municipal Wells G and H in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Our investigation, initiated following the May 1979 well closures, has identified significant volatile organic compound (VOC) contamination in the local aquifer system. Preliminary findings indicate multiple potential sources of contamination within the Aberjona River Valley watershed, with particular focus on industrial facilities operated by W.R. Grace Company (Cryovac Division) and properties associated with Beatrice Foods Inc.

## BACKGROUND AND SCOPE

Wells G and H, which commenced operations in 1964 and 1966 respectively, were closed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in May 1979 following routine testing that revealed the presence of trichloroethylene (TCE) and other volatile organic compounds at levels exceeding acceptable standards for potable water supply. These wells had served as supplemental water sources for the eastern sections of Woburn, providing approximately 2.5 million gallons per day to residential areas during peak operational periods.

The EPA Region I office was formally notified of the contamination on June 15, 1979, and initiated preliminary assessment activities under Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act authorities. Our field investigation team was deployed to the site on July 8, 1979, with the mandate to:

1. Characterize the extent and nature of groundwater contamination
2. Identify potential sources of contamination within the watershed
3. Assess migration pathways and environmental fate of contaminants
4. Evaluate potential risks to public health and the environment
5. Recommend appropriate response actions

## INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY

Our investigation has employed a systematic approach combining historical research, field sampling, and analytical testing. The study area encompasses approximately 2.3 square miles within the Aberjona River Valley, bounded by the Middlesex Canal to the east, Route 128 to the north, and residential developments to the south and west.

### Sampling Protocol

Between August 1979 and February 1980, our team collected groundwater samples from 47 monitoring points, including:
- 12 existing private wells
- 18 newly installed monitoring wells
- 8 surface water sampling points along the Aberjona River
- 9 soil boring samples from suspected source areas

All samples have been analyzed for volatile organic compounds using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods at the EPA Environmental Research Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio. Quality assurance protocols include duplicate sampling, chain-of-custody procedures, and blank sample analysis.

### Site Characterization Activities

Our hydrogeological investigation has revealed a complex aquifer system consisting of glacial outwash deposits overlying bedrock at depths ranging from 45 to 85 feet below ground surface. Groundwater flow is generally from north to south, following the topographic gradient of the Aberjona River Valley. Hydraulic conductivity measurements indicate highly permeable conditions that facilitate rapid contaminant migration.

## PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

### Contaminant Distribution

Laboratory analysis has confirmed the presence of multiple volatile organic compounds throughout the study area. Primary contaminants of concern include:

- **Trichloroethylene (TCE)**: Detected at concentrations ranging from 5.2 parts per billion (ppb) to 267 ppb
- **Tetrachloroethylene (PCE)**: Present at levels up to 184 ppb
- **1,1,1-Trichloroethane**: Concentrations ranging from non-detect to 89 ppb
- **Chloroform**: Detected at levels up to 45 ppb

The highest concentrations have been identified in monitoring wells MW-7 and MW-12, located approximately 800 feet northeast and 1,200 feet southwest of the closed municipal wells, respectively.

### Potential Source Areas

Our investigation has identified several areas of particular concern based on historical land use, current industrial activities, and contaminant distribution patterns:

#### W.R. Grace Company Facility (Cryovac Division)
Located at 369 Washington Street, this facility has operated continuously since 1962, manufacturing packaging machinery and related products. Site reconnaissance has revealed:
- Multiple above-ground storage tanks containing TCE and other solvents
- Historical disposal areas in the northeastern portion of the property
- Soil staining and odors consistent with organic solvent contamination
- Groundwater monitoring well GW-3, installed 150 feet downgradient from the main production facility, shows TCE concentrations of 156 ppb

#### Former Riley Tannery Property
The John J. Riley Company tannery, located at 228 Salem Street and currently owned by Beatrice Foods Inc., operated from 1853 until 1978. Historical records indicate extensive use of chromium-based tanning agents and organic solvents. Site conditions include:
- Abandoned waste lagoons containing discolored sediments
- Soil contamination with heavy metals and organic compounds
- Adjacent 14.73-acre undeveloped parcel showing evidence of waste disposal activities
- Monitoring well MW-12, positioned downgradient from the tannery complex, exhibits PCE levels of 184 ppb

### Migration Pathways

Groundwater flow modeling indicates that contaminants from both identified source areas are migrating toward the Aberjona River and the location of the closed municipal wells. Conservative transport calculations suggest that contamination from the Grace facility could reach Wells G and H within 18 to 24 months under current hydraulic conditions. Contaminants from the Riley tannery area follow a more complex pathway but ultimately converge with the primary groundwater flow system.

## ONGOING ACTIVITIES

### Expanded Monitoring Network

Installation of additional monitoring wells is scheduled for completion by March 31, 1980. These wells will provide enhanced definition of contaminant plume boundaries and facilitate long-term monitoring of remedial effectiveness.

### Source Investigation

Detailed site investigations at both the Grace facility and the former Riley tannery are planned for April 1980. These investigations will include:
- Soil boring and sampling programs
- Geophysical surveys to locate buried waste materials
- Historical waste disposal practice documentation
- Facility inspection and records review

### Risk Assessment

A comprehensive human health risk assessment is being prepared in coordination with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control. This assessment will evaluate potential exposure pathways and health risks associated with past consumption of contaminated water from Wells G and H.

## PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on current findings, our team recommends the following immediate actions:

1. **Continued Well Closure**: Wells G and H should remain closed pending completion of remedial actions and demonstration of water quality compliance.

2. **Source Control**: Immediate steps should be taken to prevent further contaminant releases from identified source areas, including:
   - Installation of interim containment measures at the Grace facility
   - Stabilization of waste materials at the former Riley tannery site

3. **Alternative Water Supply**: The City of Woburn should continue to rely on alternative water sources and consider permanent system modifications to eliminate dependence on the contaminated aquifer.

4. **Regulatory Action**: Formal enforcement proceedings should be considered against responsible parties to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and cost recovery for investigation and remediation expenses.

## RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

Completion of the investigation and initiation of remedial actions will require continued funding and personnel support. Current budget projections indicate total investigation costs of $485,000 through fiscal year 1981. Additional resources will be required for remedial design and implementation activities.

## CONCLUSION

The Woburn groundwater contamination represents a significant environmental and public health concern requiring immediate and sustained response efforts. Our investigation has successfully identified probable sources of contamination and characterized the extent of aquifer impact. Continued investigation and prompt remedial action are essential to protect public health and restore the beneficial use of this important water resource.

I will continue to provide regular updates on investigation progress and will coordinate closely with state and local officials to ensure appropriate response measures are implemented expeditiously.
