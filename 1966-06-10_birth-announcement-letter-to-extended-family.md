# Birth Announcement Letter

June 10, 1966

Dear Family,

I hope this letter finds you all in good health and spirits. John and I are absolutely thrilled to share the wonderful news that our precious baby boy, James Michael Anderson, was born on June 8th at 3:42 in the morning at Winchester Hospital. He weighed 7 pounds, 2 ounces and measured 20 inches long—a perfect little bundle of joy who has already stolen our hearts completely.

The delivery went smoothly, thank goodness, though it was quite an experience for this first-time mother! Dr. Richardson was wonderful throughout, and the nursing staff at Winchester couldn't have been more caring and professional. James came into this world with a healthy cry and the most beautiful dark hair you've ever seen. John was beside himself with pride—I think he called half of Woburn before dawn to share the news! He's been walking around with his chest puffed out like a peacock, showing James's photograph to anyone who will look.

We're settling in nicely at home here on Pine Street. The nursery looks absolutely perfect with all the lovely gifts so many of you sent—the yellow and white theme turned out beautifully since we didn't know whether we were having a boy or girl. James seems to love his crib, though he's keeping us up quite a bit during the night. I suppose that's to be expected with a newborn! John has been such a help, getting up for the 2 AM feedings so I can get some rest. He's taken to fatherhood like a duck to water.

Our neighbors have been so kind, bringing casseroles and offering to help with shopping. Mrs. Kelly next door made the most delicious pot roast, and the Murphys from across the street brought over a beautiful bouquet of flowers from their garden. It's wonderful living in such a caring community here in East Woburn—everyone looks out for each other, and there are so many young families with children James's age. I'm already looking forward to him playing with the neighborhood kids as he grows up.

The pediatrician says James is developing perfectly and is quite healthy. We've been giving him formula supplemented with some nursing, and he's taken to it wonderfully. The city water here is excellent—so clean and fresh—which makes preparing his bottles easy and worry-free. Dr. Patterson mentioned that Woburn has some of the best municipal water in the area, drawn from deep wells that provide pure, clean water for all the families here. It's such a comfort knowing that everything we're giving our little one is safe and healthy.

John's work at the electronics plant has been going well, and with the new baby, he's more motivated than ever to do his best. The company has been growing steadily, and there's talk of promotions in the coming year. We're hoping to save up enough to perhaps add another bedroom to the house in a few years—we're already dreaming of giving James a little brother or sister! For now, though, we're just savoring every moment with our beautiful boy.

I know how much you all wanted to be here for the birth, but please know that you were in our thoughts throughout. We can't wait for you to meet little James in person. We're planning a christening for sometime in August, and we hope you'll all be able to make the trip to Woburn. Father O'Brien at St. Charles has already agreed to perform the ceremony, and we're thinking of having a small celebration afterward at the house.

Please give our love to everyone, and thank you so much for all the congratulations and well-wishes we've already received. Knowing we have such a loving, supportive family means the world to John and me as we begin this wonderful new chapter of our lives.

With all our love and excitement,

Anne

P.S. - I'm enclosing a photograph that John took of James yesterday. Isn't he just perfect? We think he has the Anderson nose already!
