## CHIEF COMPLAINT
Progressive fatigue, recurrent fever, and easy bruising over the past six weeks. Patient presents for oncology consultation regarding suspected hematologic malignancy.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Patrick is an 11-year-old male from Woburn, Massachusetts, who has been experiencing increasing fatigue and malaise since mid-January 1981. His mother, Mrs. Catherine Toomey, reports that Patrick has been complaining of feeling "tired all the time" and has been reluctant to participate in his usual activities, including playing outside with neighborhood children. Over the past month, she has noted multiple episodes of fever ranging from 101°F to 103°F, often accompanied by night sweats that require changing of bedclothes.

Mrs. Toomey first became concerned in early February when she noticed unusual bruising on Patrick's arms and legs that appeared without any remembered trauma. The bruises have been slow to heal and new ones continue to appear with minimal contact. Patrick has also complained of intermittent abdominal pain and has shown decreased appetite, resulting in approximately 8-pound weight loss since Christmas.

The family resides at 47 Pine Street in Woburn, where they have lived since Patrick's birth. The home receives municipal water from the city wells. Mrs. Toomey reports that Patrick has always been an active, healthy child with no significant medical history prior to these recent symptoms. She notes with concern that another child in their neighborhood, James Anderson, died of leukemia in January, and she is aware of other children in the area who have been diagnosed with similar conditions.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Full-term normal vaginal delivery
- Childhood immunizations up to date
- No previous hospitalizations
- No known allergies
- No regular medications

## FAMILY HISTORY
- Father: Robert Toomey, age 34, employed at local manufacturing plant, no known medical conditions
- Mother: Catherine Toomey, age 32, homemaker, no significant medical history
- Siblings: None
- No known family history of cancer, blood disorders, or genetic conditions

## SOCIAL HISTORY
Patrick is in the sixth grade at the Hurld School in Woburn. He has been an average student but teachers report recent decline in attention and participation. The family has no history of tobacco or alcohol use. They drink municipal tap water and have done so throughout Patrick's lifetime.

## REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
**Constitutional:** Positive for fatigue, fever, night sweats, and weight loss
**HEENT:** Occasional headaches, no vision changes
**Cardiovascular:** No chest pain or palpitations
**Respiratory:** No cough or shortness of breath
**Gastrointestinal:** Decreased appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, no nausea or vomiting
**Genitourinary:** No urinary symptoms
**Musculoskeletal:** Joint aches, particularly in legs
**Skin:** Easy bruising, petechial rash noted by mother
**Neurologic:** No seizures or focal deficits
**Hematologic:** Easy bruising, possible bleeding gums per mother's report

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**Vital Signs:** Temperature 100.8°F, Heart Rate 110 bpm, Respiratory Rate 22, Blood Pressure 95/60 mmHg, Weight 65 lbs (down from 73 lbs in December 1980)

**General Appearance:** Patrick appears pale and somewhat lethargic but cooperative with examination. He appears younger than his stated age and shows obvious weight loss.

**HEENT:** Pale conjunctivae and mucous membranes. No lymphadenopathy in neck. Throat clear.

**Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic but regular rhythm. No murmurs appreciated.

**Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No increased work of breathing.

**Abdomen:** Soft, with mild tenderness in left upper quadrant. Spleen palpable 2 cm below left costal margin. No hepatomegaly appreciated.

**Extremities:** Multiple ecchymoses in various stages of healing on arms and legs. Petechial rash on lower extremities. No edema.

**Skin:** Pale with multiple bruises as noted. No rashes other than petechiae.

**Lymphatic:** No palpable lymphadenopathy in cervical, axillary, or inguinal regions.

## LABORATORY RESULTS (Drawn today)
**Complete Blood Count:**
- White Blood Cell Count: 2,800/μL (Low; Normal 4,500-13,500)
- Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL (Low; Normal 11.5-15.5)
- Hematocrit: 21.8% (Low; Normal 34-46)
- Platelet Count: 45,000/μL (Low; Normal 150,000-450,000)

**Peripheral Blood Smear:** Pending final pathology review, but preliminary examination shows presence of blast cells consistent with acute leukemia.

**Basic Metabolic Panel:** Within normal limits
**Liver Function Tests:** Pending

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Based on the clinical presentation and preliminary laboratory findings, Patrick Toomey most likely has acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The constellation of symptoms including fatigue, fever, easy bruising, weight loss, splenomegaly, and the laboratory findings of pancytopenia with blast cells on peripheral smear are highly suggestive of this diagnosis.

**Immediate Plan:**
1. **Bone marrow biopsy** scheduled for March 9, 1981, to confirm diagnosis and determine specific subtype
2. **Lumbar puncture** to evaluate for CNS involvement
3. **Chest X-ray** to assess for mediastinal masses
4. **Complete metabolic panel** including LDH, uric acid levels
5. **Blood type and crossmatch** in preparation for potential transfusion needs
6. **Coagulation studies** (PT/PTT) given bleeding tendency

**Supportive Care:**
1. **Activity restriction** - no contact sports, careful monitoring for bleeding
2. **Infection precautions** given neutropenia
3. **Transfusion support** as needed for severe anemia and thrombocytopenia
4. **Family counseling** regarding diagnosis and treatment options

**Treatment Planning:**
Pending confirmation of diagnosis, Patrick will likely require intensive chemotherapy according to current pediatric ALL protocols. Given his age and presentation, prognosis may be favorable with appropriate treatment, though this represents a serious diagnosis requiring immediate and aggressive intervention.

The patient and family have been counseled regarding the suspected diagnosis and the need for additional testing. Mrs. Toomey expressed significant distress given recent events in their community, particularly the death of James Anderson from leukemia. I have provided reassurance that advances in treatment have improved outcomes for children with ALL, while acknowledging the seriousness of the condition.

**Follow-up:**
Patrick will be admitted to the pediatric oncology unit following completion of staging studies. Treatment plan will be finalized once bone marrow results are available. Family meeting scheduled for March 10, 1981, to discuss treatment options and prognosis.

**Pain and Suffering Documentation:**
Patient exhibits clear signs of physical discomfort including fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, and general malaise. The psychological impact on both patient and family is evident, with Mrs. Toomey reporting that Patrick has expressed fear about "getting sick like Jimmy Anderson." The child's quality of life has been significantly impacted, with inability to participate in normal childhood activities and evident distress during medical procedures.
