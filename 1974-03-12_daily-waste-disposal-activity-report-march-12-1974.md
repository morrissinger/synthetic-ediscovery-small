# DAILY WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITY REPORT

**W.R. GRACE COMPANY - WOBURN FACILITY**  
68 Olympia Avenue  
Woburn, Massachusetts 01801

**TO:** Frank Morrison, Plant Manager  
**FROM:** Robert "Bob" Hennessey, Maintenance Supervisor  
**DATE:** March 12, 1974  
**REPORT PERIOD:** March 12, 1974 - Day Shift (6:00 AM - 2:00 PM)

## WASTE DISPOSAL OPERATIONS SUMMARY

### Chemical Waste Processing

**Solvent Recovery Area:**
- Processed 847 gallons of used trichloroethylene (TCE) from Cryovac production lines
- Separated 623 gallons for reclaim, remainder designated for disposal
- TCE contamination levels measured at 340 ppm in recovery tank residuals
- Perchloroethylene (PCE) waste totaled 412 gallons from degreasing operations

**Drum Storage Activities:**
- Filled eighteen (18) 55-gallon drums with mixed industrial solvents
- Drum serial numbers: GRC-2847 through GRC-2864
- Contents include TCE, PCE, methylene chloride, and production residuals
- All drums staged in northeast storage area pending disposal

### Disposal Site Operations

**Morning Activities (6:00 AM - 10:30 AM):**
Transported twelve (12) drums via flatbed truck to disposal area located approximately 400 yards northeast of main production building. Disposal site coordinates established as approximately 200 feet from property boundary adjacent to Aberjona River wetlands. Weather conditions clear, temperature 34°F, light wind from southwest.

**Disposal Method:**
Drums emptied directly into excavated pit measuring approximately 20 feet by 15 feet by 8 feet deep. Pit previously excavated using company bulldozer in November 1973. Current pit capacity estimated at 60% full. Observed strong chemical odor during emptying operations - recommend masks for future disposal activities.

**Volume Disposed:**
- Total liquid waste: 660 gallons
- Primary constituents: TCE (estimated 45%), PCE (estimated 30%), mixed organics (25%)
- Empty drums returned to storage for reuse

### Afternoon Activities (10:30 AM - 2:00 PM)

**Additional Waste Processing:**
Maintenance crew under direction of Jimmy Sullivan processed accumulated waste from Building 3 paint shop operations. Collected 340 gallons of paint thinner waste and 180 gallons of cleaning solvent residuals. Materials temporarily stored in northeast drum storage pending next disposal run.

**Equipment Maintenance:**
Repaired leak in transfer pump used for solvent handling. Replaced gasket and tightened connections. Minor spillage (estimated 15-20 gallons) occurred during repair - spillage absorbed with sawdust and disposed of in regular trash.

**Site Observations:**
Noted standing water in disposal pit from recent precipitation. Water level approximately 2 feet from surface. Observed rainbow sheen on water surface indicating hydrocarbon contamination. Recommend covering pit during rain events to prevent overflow.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

**Weather Impact:**
Recent snowmelt and rainfall have raised groundwater levels in disposal area. Observed seepage along eastern edge of pit. Water table appears higher than normal for this time of year. No immediate containment issues identified.

**Soil Conditions:**
Ground remains partially frozen but showing signs of spring thaw. Clay layer approximately 4 feet down appears to provide natural containment. Sandy layer above clay shows good absorption characteristics for liquid waste materials.

## PERSONNEL AND SAFETY

**Crew Assignment:**
- Robert Hennessey (Supervisor)
- Jimmy Sullivan (Equipment Operator)  
- Tony Marcello (General Labor)
- Pete Kowalski (General Labor)

**Safety Incidents:**
No reportable injuries during shift. Kowalski complained of headache during afternoon disposal operations - recommended he work upwind of pit area. All crew members advised to avoid prolonged exposure to disposal site vapors.

**Equipment Status:**
Flatbed truck (License MA-4729) operational but requires tire replacement. Bulldozer needs hydraulic fluid service. Transfer pump repaired and functional.

## PRODUCTION WASTE FORECAST

**Expected Volume - Next 30 Days:**
Based on current production schedules, anticipate generating approximately 1,200 gallons per week of solvent waste requiring disposal. Cryovac expansion scheduled for April may increase volumes by 25-30%. Current disposal pit capacity adequate for next 6-8 weeks of operations.

**Recommendations:**
1. Schedule excavation of secondary disposal pit by May 1974
2. Install drainage system to manage seasonal groundwater fluctuations  
3. Acquire additional 55-gallon drums for waste staging
4. Consider covered storage area for drum staging during winter months

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

**Permit Status:**
Operating under Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering general permit for industrial waste disposal. No specific reporting requirements for current disposal methods. Local fire department notification maintained for hazardous materials storage.

**Documentation:**
All disposal activities logged in facility waste management ledger. Drum serial numbers recorded for inventory tracking. No special manifests required for on-site disposal operations.

## COST ANALYSIS

**Daily Operating Costs:**
- Labor (4 workers @ 8 hours): $96.00
- Equipment operation: $23.50  
- Materials (drums, absorbent): $18.75
- Total daily disposal cost: $138.25

**Monthly Projection:**
Estimated monthly waste disposal costs of $2,765 based on current activity levels. Significantly lower than off-site disposal alternatives which would cost approximately $8,400 per month for equivalent volumes.

## NEXT SHIFT PRIORITIES

**March 13, 1974 Activities:**
1. Complete disposal of remaining 6 drums from northeast storage
2. Inspect disposal pit for any containment issues following overnight precipitation
3. Begin excavation planning for secondary disposal area
4. Coordinate with production supervisors regarding waste minimization opportunities

**Equipment Needs:**
Request approval for purchase of portable pump for pit water management. Current manual bailing method inefficient during high groundwater periods.
