## DIAGNOSIS
Primary: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), diagnosed September 15, 1979

## CURRENT TREATMENT PROTOCOL
Third cycle of induction chemotherapy per Children's Cancer Study Group Protocol 161
- Vincristine 1.5 mg/m² IV weekly
- Prednisone 40 mg/m² PO daily
- L-Asparaginase 6,000 units/m² IM three times weekly

## PRESENT ILLNESS AND TREATMENT RESPONSE

Patrick returns today for his third cycle of chemotherapy. Patient initially presented in September 1979 with a two-week history of fatigue, pallor, and easy bruising. Physical examination at that time revealed hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Complete blood count showed severe pancytopenia with circulating blasts. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed acute lymphoblastic leukemia with 85% blast cells.

Patient has tolerated the first two cycles reasonably well, though with significant constitutional symptoms. His mother reports that Patrick has experienced persistent nausea and vomiting following each treatment, requiring anti-emetic medication. She notes that he has lost approximately 8 pounds since beginning treatment and has had difficulty maintaining his appetite. Sleep patterns remain disrupted, with frequent awakening due to discomfort.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

**Vital Signs:**
- Temperature: 99.2°F
- Blood Pressure: 95/60 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 110 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 20/min
- Weight: 58 lbs (down from 66 lbs at diagnosis)
- Height: 4'2"

**General Appearance:** Thin, pale 9-year-old male appearing chronically ill. Alert and cooperative but demonstrates visible fatigue during examination.

**HEENT:** Marked pallor of conjunctiva and oral mucosa. No oral lesions or thrush noted. Lymphadenopathy has decreased since last visit.

**Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, grade II/VI systolic murmur consistent with anemia.

**Pulmonary:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no respiratory distress.

**Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender. Spleen palpable 2 cm below left costal margin, decreased from 4 cm at diagnosis. Liver edge palpable 1 cm below right costal margin.

**Extremities:** No edema. Petechiae noted on lower extremities, improved from previous visit.

**Neurologic:** Grossly intact. Patient reports occasional headaches but no focal neurological symptoms.

## LABORATORY RESULTS (March 25, 1980)

**Complete Blood Count:**
- White Blood Cell Count: 2,100/μL (normal 5,000-15,000)
- Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL (normal 11.5-13.5)
- Hematocrit: 24.8% (normal 34-40)
- Platelet Count: 45,000/μL (normal 150,000-450,000)
- Differential: 60% lymphocytes, 35% neutrophils, 5% monocytes
- No circulating blasts identified

**Chemistry Panel:**
- Glucose: 98 mg/dL
- BUN: 18 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
- Total Bilirubin: 1.2 mg/dL
- ALT: 45 U/L (slightly elevated)
- AST: 52 U/L (slightly elevated)

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Patrick continues to show encouraging response to induction chemotherapy. The absence of circulating blasts and reduction in organomegaly are positive indicators. However, he remains significantly pancytopenic, which is expected at this stage of treatment.

**Treatment Plan:**
1. Proceed with third cycle of chemotherapy as scheduled
2. Continue current anti-emetic regimen with Compazine 5mg PO q6h PRN nausea
3. Monitor for signs of infection given neutropenia
4. Parents instructed on fever precautions - contact hospital immediately for temperature >100.4°F
5. Nutritional consultation arranged to address weight loss and poor appetite
6. Social worker will continue to provide family support services

**Patient/Family Education:**
Discussed with parents the ongoing nature of treatment and expected side effects. Mother expressed concerns about Patrick's energy level and ability to participate in normal childhood activities. Explained that fatigue and activity intolerance are expected during treatment but should gradually improve as therapy progresses.

Parents were counseled regarding infection precautions, including avoiding crowded places and ensuring Patrick washes hands frequently. Emphasized importance of maintaining nutrition despite poor appetite.

**Follow-up:**
- Return in one week for CBC and clinical assessment
- Bone marrow biopsy scheduled for April 15, 1980, to evaluate treatment response
- Continue weekly clinic visits throughout this treatment cycle

## PAIN AND SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT

Patient reports moderate abdominal pain (4/10 on age-appropriate scale) which he describes as "cramping" and attributes to the medications. He also complains of headaches occurring 2-3 times per week, rated as 3-4/10 in severity. Nausea remains problematic, occurring within 2-4 hours of each medication administration and lasting 6-8 hours.

Patrick's mother reports that he frequently asks "when will I feel better" and has expressed fear about returning to the hospital for treatments. He has had difficulty sleeping, often waking during the night with complaints of stomach pain or general discomfort.

**Current Medications:**
- Vincristine 1.5 mg/m² IV weekly
- Prednisone 40 mg/m² PO daily (currently 30mg daily)
- L-Asparaginase 6,000 units/m² IM three times weekly
- Compazine 5mg PO q6h PRN nausea/vomiting
- Multivitamin daily

## NEXT APPOINTMENT
April 1, 1980, at 10:00 AM for cycle monitoring and laboratory studies.
