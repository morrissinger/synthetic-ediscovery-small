## Interview Summary

Dr. Mitchell called me this morning regarding the health study being conducted in our neighborhood. She explained that the Department of Public Health is investigating potential connections between the recent closure of Wells G and H and the health problems we've been experiencing in East Woburn. I agreed to participate and provide information about my son Michael.

## Family Background

My husband Frank and I moved to Pine Street in 1965, shortly after we were married. We chose East Woburn because it seemed like a good place to raise a family - quiet neighborhoods, decent schools, and the water always tasted clean and fresh. We never had any reason to question the safety of our tap water. The city assured us it met all standards, and we trusted that completely.

Our son Michael was born on March 12, 1966, a healthy baby weighing seven pounds, four ounces. For his first few years, Michael was active and normal in every way. He walked early, talked early, and was always full of energy. We were so proud of him and felt blessed to have such a vibrant little boy.

## Michael's Illness

Everything changed in the spring of 1972 when Michael was six years old. He began complaining of being tired all the time, which we initially attributed to spring activities and the end of the school year. But by June, he was having trouble keeping up with other children and seemed pale and listless. When he developed frequent nosebleeds and bruising appeared on his arms and legs without explanation, we knew something was seriously wrong.

Dr. Brennan at Woburn Hospital ran blood tests that showed Michael's white blood cell count was dangerously elevated. On July 18, 1972, we received the devastating diagnosis: acute lymphoblastic leukemia. I remember that day so clearly - Dr. Brennan sat us down in his office and explained that our six-year-old son had cancer. The world seemed to stop moving.

## Treatment and Decline

Michael began treatment immediately at Children's Hospital in Boston. The chemotherapy was brutal for such a small child. He lost his beautiful blonde hair, became thin and weak, and suffered from constant nausea. Despite the aggressive treatment, Michael's condition continued to deteriorate throughout 1973. The doctors tried different drug combinations, but nothing seemed to halt the progression of the disease.

We spent countless hours driving back and forth to Boston, staying overnight at the hospital when Michael's condition required it. Frank had to take time off from his job at the Ford plant, and our medical bills mounted quickly. But we would have done anything to save our son.

## Michael's Death

Michael fought bravely for almost two years, but on April 3, 1974, he lost his battle with leukemia. He was only eight years old. The funeral was held at St. Charles Church, and it seemed like the entire neighborhood came to pay their respects. So many families had watched Michael grow up, had seen him playing in our yard and riding his bicycle up and down Pine Street.

The grief was overwhelming. Frank and I struggled to understand how this could have happened to our healthy little boy. The doctors couldn't explain why a child with no family history of cancer would develop such an aggressive form of leukemia. We were told it was just "one of those things" - a random tragedy that strikes some families.

## Growing Concerns

Over the past few years, we've learned that other families in our neighborhood have faced similar tragedies. The Anderson family lost their son Jimmy to leukemia in 1973 - he was just twelve years old. The Kane family's boy Kevin died in 1974, also from leukemia, at age seven. When I heard about these other cases, I began to wonder if there might be some connection.

We all lived in the same general area of East Woburn. Our children played together, attended the same schools, and drank the same water from the municipal supply. It seemed like too much of a coincidence that so many young children in one neighborhood would develop the same rare disease.

## Water Concerns

Dr. Mitchell asked specifically about our water usage during the time Michael was growing up. We used city water for everything - drinking, cooking, bathing. Michael drank tap water daily, and I used it to mix his baby formula when he was an infant and to prepare his meals throughout his childhood. We never bought bottled water or used any kind of filtration system because we trusted that the city was providing safe, clean water.

I remember the water sometimes had a slightly chemical taste, especially during the summer months, but we assumed this was normal for treated municipal water. There were also times when the water appeared slightly cloudy or had a faint odor, but again, we didn't think anything of it. The city never issued any warnings or advisories about water quality problems.

## Recent Revelations

When we heard last week that Wells G and H had been closed due to contamination, Frank and I were shocked and angry. These wells had been operating since the mid-1960s, providing water to our neighborhood throughout Michael's entire life. If the water was contaminated with industrial chemicals, as the reports suggest, then our son may have been exposed to cancer-causing substances every single day.

Dr. Mitchell explained that the contamination appears to be related to industrial operations in the area - companies that disposed of chemical solvents improperly, allowing them to seep into the groundwater that fed Wells G and H. The thought that corporate negligence might have contributed to Michael's death is almost too painful to bear.

## Request for Justice

I want to cooperate fully with any investigation into this matter. If there's evidence that industrial contamination caused or contributed to Michael's leukemia, then those responsible must be held accountable. No other family should have to endure what we went through. No other child should suffer and die because companies chose to cut corners on waste disposal.

Michael would be thirteen years old now if he had lived. He should be in junior high school, playing baseball, thinking about girls, planning his future. Instead, we visit his grave at Wildwood Cemetery every week and wonder what he might have become. If industrial contamination robbed him of his life, then we demand justice not just for Michael, but for all the children in East Woburn who have been affected by this environmental disaster.

Dr. Mitchell assured me that the health department will continue investigating and will keep us informed of their findings. She also mentioned that families might want to consider legal action if the investigation establishes a connection between the contamination and our children's illnesses. Frank and I will certainly explore that option if it means preventing other families from suffering as we have.
