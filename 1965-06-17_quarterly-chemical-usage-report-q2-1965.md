# W.R. GRACE COMPANY
## WOBURN MANUFACTURING FACILITY

---

**TO:** Corporate Environmental Compliance Department  
**FROM:** Robert H. Steinberg, Plant Manager  
**DATE:** June 17, 1965  
**RE:** Quarterly Chemical Usage Report - Q2 1965

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report summarizes chemical usage, storage, and disposal activities at the Woburn manufacturing facility for the second quarter of 1965 (April 1 - June 30, 1965). The facility continues to operate at increased capacity to meet growing demand for our specialty chemical products, particularly in the expanding plastics and industrial coatings markets.

Total chemical throughput for Q2 1965 increased 18% over Q1 1965, reflecting robust manufacturing activity and successful expansion of our product lines. All operations have been conducted in accordance with established company procedures and applicable state regulations.

## CHEMICAL INVENTORY AND USAGE

### Primary Solvents

**Trichloroethylene (TCE)**
- Beginning inventory (April 1): 2,847 gallons
- Received during quarter: 14,250 gallons
- Used in production: 13,890 gallons
- Ending inventory (June 30): 3,207 gallons
- Primary applications: Metal degreasing operations, chemical intermediate production

**Tetrachloroethylene (PCE)**
- Beginning inventory (April 1): 1,923 gallons
- Received during quarter: 8,750 gallons
- Used in production: 8,445 gallons
- Ending inventory (June 30): 2,228 gallons
- Primary applications: Dry cleaning solvent production, specialty chemical synthesis

**Methylene Chloride**
- Beginning inventory (April 1): 1,156 gallons
- Received during quarter: 5,500 gallons
- Used in production: 5,890 gallons
- Ending inventory (June 30): 766 gallons
- Primary applications: Paint stripper formulations, aerosol propellant

### Industrial Chemicals

**Chromium Compounds (various forms)**
- Total usage Q2 1965: 2,340 pounds
- Primary applications: Metal finishing, corrosion inhibitors, specialty coatings
- Storage: Building 7, designated chromium storage area

**Lead-based Compounds**
- Total usage Q2 1965: 1,875 pounds
- Primary applications: Paint additives, industrial primers
- Storage: Building 12, secure storage facility

## WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL

### Liquid Waste Streams

During Q2 1965, the facility generated approximately 3,450 gallons of liquid chemical waste requiring disposal. This represents a 22% increase over Q1 1965 due to expanded production activities. Current disposal methods include:

**On-site Treatment**
- Neutralization of acidic waste streams: 1,200 gallons
- Oil-water separation: 890 gallons
- Evaporation ponds: 675 gallons

**Off-site Disposal**
- Contracted disposal through Riley Chemical Services: 685 gallons
- Transportation to approved disposal sites in accordance with state requirements

### Solid Waste Management

Solid chemical waste totaling 4,200 pounds was generated during the quarter, consisting primarily of contaminated packaging materials, spent catalysts, and production residues. All solid waste has been containerized and stored in designated areas pending scheduled removal by authorized waste contractors.

## ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

The facility continues to monitor groundwater quality through our network of monitoring wells established in 1963. Quarterly sampling was conducted in April and June 1965 by Consolidated Testing Laboratories of Boston.

**Monitoring Well MW-1 (upgradient)**
- Location: North of Building 3
- Depth: 45 feet
- Sampling dates: April 15, June 18
- Parameters tested: pH, dissolved solids, chlorinated solvents
- Results: Within normal ranges

**Monitoring Well MW-2 (downgradient)**
- Location: Southeast of waste storage area
- Depth: 52 feet
- Sampling dates: April 15, June 18
- Parameters tested: pH, dissolved solids, chlorinated solvents, heavy metals
- Results: Slight elevation in chlorinated compounds noted in June sample

**Monitoring Well MW-3 (property boundary)**
- Location: Eastern property line
- Depth: 48 feet
- Sampling dates: April 15, June 18
- Parameters tested: pH, dissolved solids, chlorinated solvents
- Results: Within acceptable limits

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

The facility maintains compliance with all applicable Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations regarding chemical storage and handling. Regular inspections of storage areas, containment systems, and disposal practices have been conducted by facility personnel.

**State Reporting Requirements**
- Monthly chemical usage reports submitted to Massachusetts DPH
- Quarterly waste disposal manifests filed with state authorities
- Annual facility inspection completed May 1965 with no violations noted

**Federal Compliance**
- All interstate chemical shipments properly documented
- OSHA workplace safety standards implemented and maintained
- Employee training programs updated to reflect current best practices

## OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS

Several improvements to chemical handling and storage procedures have been implemented during Q2 1965:

1. **Enhanced Containment Systems**: Installation of secondary containment around major solvent storage tanks in Building 6
2. **Improved Inventory Tracking**: Implementation of daily chemical usage logs to improve accuracy of consumption reporting
3. **Employee Training**: Completion of safety training for 23 production workers on proper handling of chlorinated solvents
4. **Equipment Upgrades**: Replacement of aging transfer pumps with new sealed systems to reduce vapors and spillage

## FUTURE PLANNING

Based on current market projections and planned facility expansions, we anticipate a 25-30% increase in chemical usage for Q3 1965. This increase will primarily affect our solvent operations to support expanded specialty chemical production.

**Planned Initiatives for Q3 1965:**
- Installation of additional monitoring well (MW-4) near southern property boundary
- Expansion of waste storage capacity in Building 12
- Implementation of weekly groundwater sampling during peak production periods
- Evaluation of alternative disposal methods to reduce costs and improve efficiency

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Consider increasing frequency of groundwater sampling given the slight elevation in chlorinated compounds detected in MW-2 during June sampling
2. **Storage Optimization**: Evaluate consolidation of solvent storage to improve containment and reduce handling risks
3. **Waste Reduction**: Investigate opportunities for solvent recovery and recycling to reduce disposal costs and environmental impact
4. **Documentation**: Enhance record-keeping for all chemical transfers and disposal activities to ensure complete regulatory compliance

## CONCLUSION

The Woburn facility continues to operate efficiently while maintaining appropriate environmental stewardship. Chemical usage remains within projected parameters, and all disposal activities have been conducted in accordance with established procedures and regulatory requirements.

The facility's commitment to responsible chemical management supports both operational excellence and community safety. Continued monitoring and improvement of our environmental practices will ensure sustainable operations as we expand to meet growing market demand.
