# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Charles F. Henderson, Plant Manager  
**FROM:** Robert K. Matthews, Facility Operations Director  
**DATE:** June 30, 1974  
**RE:** Decreased Solvent Volume Discrepancies - Monthly Inventory Reconciliation

Charlie,

Our monthly inventory reconciliation for June has identified significant discrepancies in solvent volumes that require immediate attention and documentation. The attached inventory sheets show a cumulative shortage of approximately 2,847 gallons of trichloroethylene (TCE) and 1,233 gallons of perchloroethylene (PCE) that cannot be accounted for through normal production usage or documented transfers to our Nashua facility.

The discrepancies have been building over the past eighteen months, with particularly notable increases since we expanded our degreasing operations in Building 7. Tom Barbas in Quality Control has verified that our metering equipment is functioning within acceptable tolerances, and shipping records confirm that all outbound transfers have been properly documented. This leaves us with three possible explanations: equipment leakage, evaporative losses exceeding our calculated rates, or disposal activities that have not been properly logged in our waste management records.

I've instructed our maintenance crew to conduct a comprehensive inspection of all solvent storage tanks, transfer lines, and containment systems. However, given the volumes involved, I suspect we may need to review our current disposal practices more carefully. The concrete-lined pit behind Building 15 has been our primary method for handling process wastewater and solvent residues, but recent observations suggest that the containment may not be as effective as initially designed. During last week's heavy rains, I noticed standing water in areas that should remain dry if the liner were intact.

Given the regulatory environment and increasing scrutiny from state environmental agencies, I recommend we schedule a meeting with our legal counsel to discuss proper documentation of these discrepancies. We should also consider engaging an environmental consulting firm to assess our disposal methods and ensure compliance with current Massachusetts regulations. The cost of proactive remediation will be significantly less than potential fines or cleanup orders if these issues are discovered through external inspection.

Please advise on how you would like to proceed. I can have a more detailed analysis prepared by Friday if needed.

Facility Operations Director
