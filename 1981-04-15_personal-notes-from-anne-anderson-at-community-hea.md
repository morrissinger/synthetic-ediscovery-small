# Personal Notes from Community Health Forum
**April 15, 1981**

Today I attended the community health meeting at the Woburn Public Library. I felt I had to go, even though it's been less than three months since we lost Jimmy. The memories are still so raw, but I knew I needed to hear what they were saying about the water situation. I brought my notebook because I wanted to remember everything - not just for myself, but for Jimmy, and for all the other families who might be going through what we went through.

The meeting was called by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health after more parents started asking questions about why so many children in our neighborhood have gotten sick. Dr. Patricia Murphy from the state health department was there, along with someone from the EPA whose name I didn't catch. There were maybe thirty people in the room, mostly parents from the Pine Street and Orange Street area. I recognized several faces - the Kanes were there, and the Zonas, and Mrs. Robbins. We all had that same look, that hollow expression that comes from watching your child suffer.

Dr. Murphy started by talking about the "statistical anomaly" they've identified in East Woburn. She used a lot of technical language, but what it came down to was this: there have been too many cases of childhood leukemia in our small area for it to be just bad luck. She mentioned that they've been looking at our municipal water supply, specifically Wells G and H, which have been serving our neighborhood since the mid-1960s. When she said that, I felt my stomach drop. Jimmy was born in 1968, two years after Well H came online. He drank that water his entire short life.

The EPA representative talked about some preliminary testing they've done on the wells. I tried to write down the chemical names, but they were so complicated - trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene were the main ones. He said they found these chemicals in concentrations that were "concerning" and that they were investigating potential sources. What struck me was how carefully he chose his words. Nothing was definitive, nothing was certain, but there was clearly something very wrong with our water.

Mrs. Kane asked the question we were all thinking: "Are you telling us that the water we've been giving our children for years has been poisoned?" The EPA man got uncomfortable and started talking about "acceptable levels" and "ongoing investigations." But Mrs. Kane pressed him. "My son Kevin died last year," she said, her voice shaking. "He was only two years old. Are you telling me that could have been prevented?" The room got very quiet. You could hear people crying softly.

I found myself thinking about all those years of giving Jimmy water from the tap. When he was little and would wake up thirsty in the middle of the night, I'd get him a glass of water from the kitchen sink. When he was going through his treatments and needed to stay hydrated, the doctors told us to make sure he drank plenty of fluids. I gave him that water thinking I was helping him get better. The thought that I might have been making him sicker is almost unbearable.

Dr. Murphy tried to explain that they're still studying the connection between the contaminated water and the leukemia cases. She talked about "epidemiological studies" and "statistical correlations," but what she couldn't tell us was whether our children would still be alive if the water had been clean. That's the question that keeps me awake at night. Would Jimmy have celebrated his thirteenth birthday this July if Wells G and H had never been contaminated?

Someone asked about where the chemicals came from. The EPA representative mentioned that they're looking at several industrial facilities in the area, but he wouldn't name specific companies. He talked about "historical disposal practices" and "legacy contamination," which I think was his way of saying that companies had been dumping chemicals for years and it was just now catching up with us. The idea that some corporation's cost-cutting measures might have cost us our children made me feel sick and angry at the same time.

What bothers me most is how long this has been going on without anyone noticing or caring. Well G opened in 1964, and Well H in 1966. Jimmy wasn't diagnosed until 1972, but how many other children were getting sick in those early years? How many parents like me were told their child's leukemia was just "one of those things" when there might have been a preventable cause right there in our water supply?

I keep thinking about the simple trust we place in our municipal services. When you turn on the tap, you expect clean water. When your child is thirsty, you don't hesitate to fill a glass. The idea that the very system designed to protect our health might have been harming our children is a betrayal that's hard to comprehend. We trusted the city, we trusted the state, we trusted that someone was watching out for us. But nobody was watching out for the children of East Woburn.

The meeting ended with promises of more testing and more studies. Dr. Murphy said they would keep the community informed, but I could tell that any real answers were still months or maybe years away. That's not good enough for the families who are dealing with sick children right now. And it's certainly not good enough for those of us who have already lost our children.

Walking home, I passed by the old Aberjona River and thought about how connected everything is in our little corner of Woburn. The river, the groundwater, the wells, our homes - it's all part of the same system. When one part gets poisoned, it spreads. The chemicals that some company dumped years ago didn't just stay put. They moved through the ground, into our wells, into our homes, into our children.

I've decided I need to do something more than just attend meetings and take notes. Jimmy can't speak for himself anymore, but I can speak for him. I can make sure that what happened to our family - what happened to all these families - doesn't get forgotten or swept under the rug. These companies, whoever they are, need to be held accountable for what they've done to our community.

Tomorrow I'm going to start making some phone calls. I want to find a lawyer who understands environmental cases, someone who won't be intimidated by big corporations. I know it won't bring Jimmy back, but maybe it can prevent other families from going through what we've endured. Maybe it can force these companies to clean up their mess and pay for the damage they've caused.

The truth is, I don't know if I'm strong enough for what lies ahead. The grief is still so overwhelming some days that I can barely get out of bed. But when I think about Jimmy, about his courage during all those years of treatment, I know I have to try. He fought his battle with such dignity and strength. Now it's time for me to fight mine.
