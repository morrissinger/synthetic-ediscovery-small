### QUARTERLY OPERATIONS REPORT

**TO:** William T. Grogan, Corporate Environmental Officer  
**FROM:** Robert M. Harrison, Division Manager, Cryovac Division  
**DATE:** April 7, 1969  
**RE:** First Quarter 1969 Chemical Usage and Operations Summary

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Cryovac Division reports satisfactory operational performance for the first quarter of 1969, with production volumes meeting projected targets despite ongoing equipment maintenance challenges. Chemical consumption patterns remain consistent with previous quarters, though we have noted increased usage of certain solvents due to expanded film processing operations. Waste disposal procedures continue to follow established protocols, with all materials handled in accordance with current industry standards.

## PRODUCTION OVERVIEW

First quarter production totaled 2,847,500 pounds of plastic film products, representing a 12% increase over Q1 1968. Our Woburn facility operated at 87% capacity throughout the quarter, with temporary shutdowns occurring only during scheduled maintenance periods in February. The expansion of our shrink-wrap film line, completed in December 1968, contributed significantly to increased throughput.

Key production metrics:
- Polyethylene film: 1,923,400 lbs
- Polyvinylidene chloride film: 924,100 lbs
- Specialty products: 156,200 lbs

## CHEMICAL USAGE AND INVENTORY

Chemical consumption for Q1 1969 reflects the increased production volume and continued reliance on proven formulations. Our procurement department maintained adequate inventory levels throughout the quarter, with no significant supply disruptions.

### Primary Solvents and Processing Chemicals

**Trichloroethylene (TCE):** 18,450 gallons consumed during the quarter for degreasing operations and equipment cleaning. This represents a 15% increase over Q4 1968, attributable to expanded cleaning protocols implemented following equipment upgrades. Current inventory: 3,200 gallons. Supplier: Allied Chemical Corporation.

**Perchloroethylene (PCE):** 12,780 gallons utilized primarily for vapor degreasing of metal components and cleaning of production equipment. Usage increased 8% from previous quarter due to enhanced quality control measures. Current inventory: 2,850 gallons. Supplier: Dow Chemical Company.

**1,1,1-Trichloroethane:** 6,340 gallons consumed for precision cleaning applications and as a carrier solvent in specialty coating processes. This chemical has proven highly effective for removing residual oils and contaminants from film surfaces. Current inventory: 1,450 gallons.

**Methylene Chloride:** 4,920 gallons used in various cleaning and processing applications. This solvent continues to demonstrate excellent performance characteristics for our specific applications. Current inventory: 890 gallons.

### Additional Chemical Inventory

- Acetone: 3,100 gallons (cleaning and thinning applications)
- Toluene: 2,450 gallons (coating formulations)
- Xylene: 1,890 gallons (specialty applications)
- Various plasticizers and stabilizers: 45,600 lbs total

## WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL

The division continues to manage chemical waste through established procedures that ensure safe and economical disposal while maintaining operational efficiency. All waste handling follows company guidelines and applicable regulations.

### Liquid Waste Streams

Spent solvents and contaminated liquids totaling approximately 8,900 gallons were generated during Q1 1969. These materials were handled through our standard disposal protocols:

- **On-site treatment:** 3,400 gallons of lightly contaminated solvents were processed through our recovery still, yielding 2,100 gallons of reclaimed material suitable for reuse in non-critical applications.

- **Lagoon disposal:** 4,200 gallons of waste liquids were directed to our on-site disposal lagoons, where natural evaporation and soil filtration provide effective treatment. These lagoons, constructed in 1967, continue to operate within design parameters.

- **Off-site disposal:** 1,300 gallons of heavily contaminated materials were removed by licensed waste hauling contractor Yankee Environmental Services for proper disposal at approved facilities.

### Solid Waste Management

Contaminated solid materials, including spent filters, cleaning rags, and packaging materials, totaled approximately 12 tons during the quarter. These materials were consolidated and removed by our regular waste hauling service. Metal containers and drums are cleaned and returned to suppliers when possible, supporting our cost-reduction initiatives.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The Cryovac Division remains committed to responsible environmental practices while maintaining competitive manufacturing costs. Our current waste management approach balances operational requirements with community considerations.

The on-site lagoon system continues to provide effective treatment for liquid wastes, with regular monitoring indicating proper functioning. Visual inspections conducted monthly show normal evaporation rates and no unusual conditions. The lagoons are positioned in an area with suitable soil characteristics that provide natural filtration of any residual materials.

We maintain awareness of evolving environmental regulations and industry best practices. Recent discussions with other Grace divisions have highlighted potential changes in waste handling requirements, and we continue to evaluate our procedures accordingly.

## OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Several operational issues merit attention as we move into Q2 1969:

1. **Solvent Recovery Efficiency:** Our distillation equipment requires maintenance to improve recovery rates. Current recovery yields of 62% could potentially be improved to 70-75% with modest capital investment.

2. **Inventory Management:** Increased production volumes require larger chemical inventories. We recommend expanding storage capacity to reduce procurement costs through bulk purchasing.

3. **Equipment Maintenance:** Aging degreasing equipment shows signs of increased solvent consumption. Replacement or major overhaul should be considered for the FY1970 capital budget.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All operations continue to comply with applicable federal, state, and local regulations. We maintain required permits and documentation, with no compliance issues identified during the quarter. Massachusetts Department of Public Health inspections in February found no violations of current standards.

The division maintains appropriate safety equipment and procedures for chemical handling, with regular training provided to all personnel involved in chemical operations. Safety incident rates remain well below industry averages.

## FINANCIAL SUMMARY

Chemical costs for Q1 1969 totaled $127,450, representing 4.2% of total production costs. This compares favorably with the 4.5% experienced in Q1 1968, despite increased production volumes. Waste disposal costs totaled $18,900 for the quarter, including both on-site treatment and off-site removal services.

Cost reduction initiatives implemented during the quarter include improved solvent recovery procedures and enhanced inventory management, contributing to the favorable cost performance.

## CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

The Cryovac Division successfully navigated Q1 1969 with strong production performance and effective cost management. Chemical usage patterns reflect our commitment to efficient operations while maintaining product quality standards.

Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate continued growth in production volumes, particularly in specialty film products. Chemical consumption is expected to increase proportionally, and we are prepared to meet these requirements through our established supply relationships and inventory management procedures.

We remain committed to operating practices that balance production efficiency, cost effectiveness, and responsible environmental stewardship. The division will continue to monitor evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements to ensure continued compliance and operational excellence.
