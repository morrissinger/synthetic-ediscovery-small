# Letter to Woburn Public Library Requesting Meeting Space

December 18, 1979

Woburn Public Library  
45 Pleasant Street  
Woburn, Massachusetts 01801

Dear Library Staff,

I hope this letter finds you well during this holiday season. My name is Kevin Kane Sr., and I am writing as a concerned resident of East Woburn regarding a matter of urgent community importance.

As you may be aware, our community has been dealing with the recent closure of municipal Wells G and H this past May due to chemical contamination. This situation has affected many families in our neighborhood, and I believe there is a pressing need for residents to come together to discuss our concerns and determine what actions we might take moving forward. Several of us have been talking informally about the health issues we've observed in our children and the potential connection to our water supply, but we need a proper forum to organize our thoughts and efforts.

I am writing to request the use of one of your meeting rooms for a community gathering in early January 1980. We would need space to accommodate approximately 20-30 residents who are interested in learning more about the well contamination situation and discussing how we might work together to protect our families' health. The meeting would be educational in nature, focusing on sharing information about what we know regarding the water contamination and exploring options for seeking answers from city officials and health authorities.

My son Kevin Jr. was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia earlier this year, and through conversations with other parents in our area, I have learned that several other children have been diagnosed with similar serious illnesses. While I cannot say with certainty that these health problems are related to our water supply, the timing of these diagnoses following years of drinking water from Wells G and H is deeply concerning to me and other parents. We feel it is our responsibility as community members to investigate these potential connections and advocate for our children's welfare.

The meeting I am proposing would be conducted in a respectful and orderly manner. We are not seeking to create controversy or point fingers without evidence, but rather to gather as a community to share our experiences and determine appropriate next steps. I believe the library, as a cornerstone of our community's civic life, would be an appropriate venue for such a discussion. We would be happy to work with your staff to ensure the meeting follows all library policies and procedures.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to reserve a meeting room for either the evening of January 8th or January 15th, 1980, from approximately 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. If neither of these dates works with your schedule, I would welcome alternative suggestions. I can be reached at my home at 617-933-2847 during evening hours, or you may send correspondence to my address at 12 Cranch Street, Woburn.

I want to emphasize that this gathering would be focused on constructive community dialogue and information sharing. As residents who have lived in East Woburn for many years and raised our families here, we simply want to understand what has happened to our water supply and what it might mean for our children's health. The library has always been a place where our community comes together to learn and discuss important matters, and I believe this situation certainly qualifies as such.

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to hearing from you and hope that we can arrange a suitable time and space for our neighbors to meet. Your assistance in providing a venue for this important community discussion would be greatly appreciated by many families in our area.

Respectfully yours,

Kevin Kane Sr.
