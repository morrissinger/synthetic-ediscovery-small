# W.R. GRACE COMPANY
## QUARTERLY CHEMICAL INVENTORY REPORT
### Second Quarter 1974

**TO:** Corporate Management, W.R. Grace Company  
**FROM:** Harold F. Morrison, Operations Director  
**DATE:** June 30, 1974  
**RE:** Q2 1974 Chemical Inventory and Disposal Activities

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the quarterly chemical inventory and disposal activities for W.R. Grace Company operations during the second quarter of 1974. Total chemical inventory processed during this period reached 847,300 gallons across all facilities, with primary focus on industrial solvents and manufacturing byproducts. Disposal operations have been conducted in accordance with established company protocols to minimize operational costs while maintaining production efficiency.

## FACILITY OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

### Woburn Manufacturing Complex

The Woburn facility maintained consistent production levels throughout Q2, processing approximately 312,400 gallons of various chemical compounds. Primary operations centered on trichloroethylene (TCE) degreasing processes, with secondary handling of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and various chlorinated compounds supporting our manufacturing contracts.

**Key Chemical Volumes (Q2 1974):**
- Trichloroethylene: 156,800 gallons processed
- Tetrachloroethylene: 78,200 gallons processed
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 45,600 gallons processed
- Mixed chlorinated solvents: 31,800 gallons processed

Production efficiency remained within acceptable parameters, with waste generation rates consistent with previous quarters. The facility's proximity to residential areas continues to require careful management of our disposal protocols to avoid unnecessary scrutiny from local authorities.

### Chemical Disposal Activities

Disposal operations during Q2 followed established procedures designed to minimize storage costs and maintain operational flexibility. Primary disposal methods included on-site burial of solid chemical waste and controlled discharge of liquid waste through approved channels.

**Disposal Summary:**
- On-site burial: 23,400 gallons of solidified chemical waste
- Controlled discharge: 18,700 gallons of liquid waste
- Third-party disposal: 8,900 gallons of specialized compounds

The on-site disposal area located in the rear section of the Woburn property has proven adequate for current waste volumes. Burial operations utilize standard industrial practices, with waste materials placed in excavated areas and covered with soil to prevent surface contamination. This method has proven cost-effective and eliminates the expense of third-party disposal services for the majority of our waste stream.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

Current operations maintain compliance with applicable federal and state regulations governing chemical handling and disposal. The facility operates under standard industrial practices for waste management, with no specific regulatory oversight requiring detailed documentation of disposal methods or locations.

Local authorities have not requested facility inspections during this quarter, and no complaints have been filed regarding our operations. The company's established protocols for chemical handling continue to meet industry standards while supporting our commitment to cost-effective operations.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The Woburn facility's environmental management program focuses on practical solutions that balance operational requirements with reasonable environmental precautions. Chemical disposal activities are conducted with appropriate consideration for local conditions, including soil composition and drainage patterns in the disposal area.

Groundwater monitoring is not currently required by regulation, and the facility's disposal methods are consistent with standard industrial practices throughout the region. The natural soil conditions at the Woburn site provide adequate filtration for disposed materials, and the facility's location offers sufficient distance from municipal water sources to prevent any operational interference.

## COST ANALYSIS

Q2 disposal operations achieved significant cost savings compared to exclusive use of third-party disposal services. On-site disposal methods reduced waste management expenses by approximately $47,000 during the quarter, contributing directly to improved operational margins.

**Cost Breakdown:**
- On-site disposal operations: $12,400
- Third-party disposal services: $18,900
- Transportation and handling: $6,700
- **Total disposal costs:** $38,000
- **Estimated third-party equivalent:** $85,000
- **Net savings:** $47,000

These savings support the continued viability of current disposal protocols while maintaining full compliance with applicable regulations.

## OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES

The primary operational challenge during Q2 involved managing increased chemical volumes resulting from expanded production contracts. The facility's disposal capacity proved adequate for current volumes, though continued growth may require evaluation of additional disposal options.

Weather conditions during May created temporary delays in burial operations, requiring short-term storage of approximately 3,200 gallons of waste materials. These materials were successfully disposed of by month-end without operational impact.

Staff training on chemical handling procedures continued during the quarter, with emphasis on safety protocols and proper disposal techniques. No incidents requiring medical attention occurred during Q2 operations.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on Q2 operations, the following recommendations support continued efficient chemical management:

1. **Maintain Current Disposal Protocols:** Existing on-site disposal methods have proven effective and cost-efficient, supporting continued use of established procedures.

2. **Expand Disposal Capacity:** Consider expansion of on-site disposal areas to accommodate projected volume increases in Q3 and Q4.

3. **Monitor Regulatory Environment:** Continue monitoring federal and state regulatory developments that might affect disposal operations, while maintaining current compliance status.

4. **Cost Optimization:** Evaluate opportunities for further cost reduction in chemical handling and disposal operations without compromising operational efficiency.

## CONCLUSION

Q2 1974 operations maintained consistent performance in chemical inventory management and disposal activities. The Woburn facility's established protocols continue to provide cost-effective solutions for chemical waste management while supporting production requirements. Current disposal methods offer significant cost advantages over third-party alternatives while maintaining appropriate environmental considerations.

The facility's operational efficiency and compliance status support continued use of established procedures through the remainder of 1974. Regular monitoring of disposal capacity and regulatory requirements will ensure continued operational success while maintaining cost-effective chemical management practices.
