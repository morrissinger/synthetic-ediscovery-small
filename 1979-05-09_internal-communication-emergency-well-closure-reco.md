# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Mayor Edward F. Reilly  
**FROM:** Thomas P. McKenna, Director of Public Works  
**DATE:** May 9, 1979  
**RE:** Emergency Well Closure Recommendation - Wells G and H

---

## Immediate Action Required

Mr. Mayor, I am writing to inform you of a critical situation that has developed regarding our municipal water supply and to recommend immediate closure of Wells G and H pending further investigation. The preliminary test results I received this morning from the state laboratory indicate the presence of volatile organic compounds in concentrations that may pose a significant public health risk.

The routine contamination testing we initiated last week on Wells G and H has revealed the presence of trichloroethylene and other industrial solvents at levels that exceed acceptable standards for potable water. While we await the complete analytical report, the preliminary findings are sufficiently concerning that I believe we must act immediately to protect public health. These wells, which have been operational since 1964 and 1966 respectively, currently supply approximately 30% of the water to East Woburn residential areas.

## Background and Current Status

Wells G and H were drilled to supplement our primary water sources and have been providing reliable service for over a decade. The wells tap into the Aberjona River Valley aquifer system, which we believed to be protected from surface contamination. However, the presence of industrial chemicals suggests that groundwater contamination has occurred through subsurface migration from unknown sources. The affected area includes several major industrial facilities, including the W.R. Grace Company operations at 369 Washington Street and other manufacturing concerns in the vicinity.

I have already contacted our water treatment supervisor to begin preparations for shutting down the wells and adjusting our distribution system to compensate for the reduced capacity. We will need to increase pumping from our other municipal wells and may need to implement temporary conservation measures to ensure adequate supply during peak demand periods. The Public Works Department is prepared to make these operational changes immediately upon your authorization.

## Recommended Actions

I strongly recommend that you authorize the immediate closure of Wells G and H effective today. Additionally, we should notify the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and request their assistance in conducting a comprehensive investigation into the source and extent of the contamination. We will also need to coordinate with the state environmental authorities to determine the appropriate remediation measures and to assess whether other water sources may be affected.

The financial implications of this closure will include increased operational costs for our remaining wells, potential infrastructure modifications to our distribution system, and the costs associated with comprehensive testing and investigation. However, the potential liability exposure from continued operation of contaminated wells far outweighs these immediate costs. Our municipal insurance carrier should be notified of this situation as soon as possible.

I am available to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the implementation of these recommendations and to address any questions you may have regarding this matter. Time is of the essence, and I believe we must act decisively to protect the health and safety of our residents while minimizing the city's potential legal exposure.
