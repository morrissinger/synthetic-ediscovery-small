Gentlemen:

I write to place an urgent order for chemical supplies required for our expanding tanning operations here in East Woburn. As we approach the winter season, demand for our leather goods has increased substantially, and we find ourselves in need of additional processing materials to maintain production schedules and fulfill our contractual obligations to wholesale buyers throughout New England.

Please arrange for immediate delivery of the following chemical supplies to our facility at 228 Salem Street: Twenty-five barrels of chromium sulfate solution for chrome tanning processes, fifteen drums of sodium dichromate for hide preparation, thirty gallons of sulfuric acid concentrate for acidulation, ten barrels of lime solution for hair removal and hide swelling, and twenty-five gallons of various aniline dyes including methyl violet, crystal violet, and malachite green for leather finishing operations. Additionally, we require five drums of benzidine-based yellow dye for specialty orders and ten gallons of formaldehyde solution for preservation purposes. We also need twenty barrels of various organic solvents including toluene, benzene, and carbon tetrachloride for degreasing and cleaning operations throughout our facility.

Mr. Riley has instructed me to emphasize the critical nature of this order, as we have committed to completing several large contracts before the end of November. Our current chemical inventory has been depleted more rapidly than anticipated due to increased production demands, and any delay in receiving these materials would result in significant financial losses and damage to our reputation among established customers. We have arranged for our usual payment terms of net thirty days following delivery, and our accounting department has confirmed that funds are available to cover this substantial order.

I must also mention that we have been experiencing some difficulties with waste disposal from our tanning operations, particularly with the chromium-bearing solutions and dye residues. The current practice of discharging spent chemicals into the drainage systems behind our facility has proven adequate for our needs, though we understand that future expansion may require consideration of alternative disposal methods. For now, however, our primary concern remains maintaining sufficient chemical supplies to meet production demands, and we trust that your company can provide the reliable service we have come to expect.

Please confirm receipt of this order and provide an estimated delivery date at your earliest convenience. Given the urgency of our situation, we would be willing to pay premium rates for expedited shipping if necessary. Our facility operates from six o'clock in the morning until eight o'clock in the evening, Monday through Saturday, and deliveries can be accepted at any time during these hours.

I remain,

Very truly yours,

**William Patterson**
