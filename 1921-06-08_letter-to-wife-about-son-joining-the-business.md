# Letter from John J. Riley to Margaret Riley

**June 8th, 1921**

My Dearest Margaret,

I hope this letter finds you and the children in good health. I write to you this evening from the office at the tannery, having spent another long day overseeing the leather processing operations. The business continues to prosper, praise be to God, and our customer orders from Boston and Providence remain steady despite the economic uncertainties that have plagued other industries since the war's end.

I have been giving considerable thought to our discussions regarding young Patrick's future, and I believe the time has come to bring him into the family business in a more substantial capacity. At nineteen years of age, our son has demonstrated both the physical stamina and mental acuity necessary to understand the complexities of leather manufacturing. This morning, I observed him working alongside the men in the processing shed, and I was impressed by his willingness to learn the technical aspects of hide preparation and chemical treatment. He shows particular aptitude for understanding the timing and proportions required for the various solutions we employ in our tanning processes.

The leather industry in Massachusetts faces increasing competition from operations in other states, particularly those in the western territories where labor costs remain lower. If we are to maintain our position in the market, we must ensure that the next generation of Rileys possesses comprehensive knowledge of both the traditional methods passed down from the old country and the modern innovations that will keep us competitive. Patrick's education at the parish school has provided him with sufficient arithmetic and reading skills to manage the business correspondence and maintain our customer accounts. More importantly, he understands the value of honest work and the responsibility we bear to our employees and their families.

I propose to begin Patrick's formal apprenticeship immediately following the completion of the summer orders. He will start by learning the fundamentals of hide selection and preparation, then progress to understanding the chemical processes that transform raw materials into finished leather goods. The work is demanding and requires careful attention to the various solutions and treatments we employ, but I have confidence that he will master these skills as I did when my own father brought me into the business. The tannery operation at Salem Street has grown considerably since we established it twelve years ago, and we now process nearly twice the volume of hides we handled in our first year of operation.

I must confess, Margaret, that the physical demands of this business weigh more heavily upon me with each passing year. The long hours spent overseeing the chemical baths and drying operations, combined with the administrative responsibilities of managing our workforce and maintaining customer relationships, leave me increasingly fatigued. Having Patrick working alongside me will not only ensure the continuation of our family enterprise but will also allow me to delegate some of the more strenuous aspects of daily operations to younger, stronger hands.

The location of our facility continues to serve us well, with easy access to the railroad for shipments and proximity to the Aberjona River for our water needs. The other manufacturing operations that have established themselves in this section of East Woburn provide a ready community of skilled workers, and we have developed good relationships with our neighboring businesses. I believe this area will continue to grow as an industrial center, which bodes well for the long-term prospects of our tannery.

Please discuss this matter with Patrick when you see fit, though I suspect he has already anticipated this conversation. I have observed his growing interest in the business operations, and he has begun asking more sophisticated questions about our processes and customer relationships. I believe he understands that this represents not merely employment, but the assumption of responsibility for a family legacy that we must preserve and strengthen for future generations.

Give my love to the younger children, and tell them that their father thinks of them constantly during these long working days. I hope to complete the current batch of orders by Saturday evening so that we might enjoy a proper Sunday dinner together as a family.

Your devoted husband,

**John J. Riley**
