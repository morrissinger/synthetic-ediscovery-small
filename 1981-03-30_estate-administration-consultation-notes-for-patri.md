**RE: Estate Administration Consultation - Estate of Patrick Toomey, Deceased**

Dear Mr. Toomey:

Following our consultation today regarding the administration of your son Patrick's estate, I am providing these written notes to summarize our discussion and outline the necessary steps moving forward. As we discussed, the death of a minor child presents unique challenges in probate proceedings, particularly given the circumstances surrounding Patrick's passing and the potential for future legal action.

## Estate Administration Overview

Patrick Toomey, age 7, died on February 14, 1981, from acute lymphocytic leukemia. As his surviving parent and natural guardian, you have the right to petition the Suffolk County Probate Court for appointment as administrator of his estate. While Patrick's estate contains minimal tangible assets—primarily personal effects, clothing, toys, and a small savings account with approximately $127—the estate may have significant value in potential wrongful death claims arising from his illness and death.

The preliminary medical records we reviewed indicate that Patrick was diagnosed with leukemia in September 1979 at age 5, following several months of symptoms including fatigue, recurring infections, and unexplained bruising. His treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital involved extensive chemotherapy protocols over eighteen months before his condition deteriorated in late 1980. The medical expenses incurred during his treatment exceeded $45,000, most of which was covered by your health insurance through Raytheon Company, though significant out-of-pocket expenses remain.

## Potential Wrongful Death Action

Based on our preliminary discussion and the information you provided regarding your residence at 52 Pine Street in Woburn, it appears Patrick consumed water from municipal Wells G and H throughout his lifetime. These wells have been identified by state health officials as potentially contaminated with industrial solvents, including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, which are suspected carcinogens. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has documented elevated leukemia rates among children in your neighborhood, and several families have already initiated consultations with attorneys regarding potential litigation.

The wrongful death statute in Massachusetts (M.G.L. Chapter 229, Section 2) provides that an administrator may recover damages for the conscious pain and suffering of the deceased, medical and funeral expenses, and loss of reasonably expected net income. In Patrick's case, while future earning capacity calculations for a seven-year-old present challenges, the conscious pain and suffering he endured during his two-year illness could form the basis for substantial damages. Additionally, the extraordinary medical expenses, funeral costs of $3,200, and the emotional distress suffered by your family may be recoverable.

## Recommended Actions

**Immediate Steps (Next 30 Days):**
1. File petition for administration with Suffolk County Probate Court, including death certificate, inventory of assets, and proposed bond
2. Obtain certified copies of all medical records from Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Sarah Chen's pediatric oncology practice, and any other treating physicians
3. Preserve all documentation related to your residence at 52 Pine Street, including utility bills, tax records, and any correspondence regarding water quality
4. Document all expenses related to Patrick's illness, including medical bills, travel costs for treatments, lost wages, and funeral expenses

**Long-term Considerations (Next 90 Days):**
1. Consult with environmental litigation specialists regarding potential defendants, including W.R. Grace Company, Beatrice Foods, and other industrial entities that may have contributed to groundwater contamination
2. Coordinate with other affected families in Woburn to share information and potentially join consolidated legal action
3. Obtain expert medical testimony linking Patrick's leukemia to chemical exposure through contaminated drinking water
4. Investigate insurance coverage and potential recovery from responsible corporate entities

## Legal Challenges and Considerations

The emerging litigation surrounding Woburn's water contamination will likely face significant challenges in establishing causation between specific chemical exposure and individual cases of leukemia. Industrial defendants will undoubtedly argue that childhood leukemia has multiple potential causes and that proving specific causation is scientifically impossible. However, the clustering of cases in your neighborhood, combined with documented contamination of the municipal water supply, may provide sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment motions and proceed to trial.

The statute of limitations for wrongful death actions in Massachusetts is three years from the date of death, providing until February 14, 1984, to commence legal proceedings. However, given the complexity of environmental litigation and the need to coordinate with other plaintiffs, earlier action is advisable. The discovery process will likely require extensive environmental testing, medical expert testimony, and corporate document production, all of which require significant time and resources.

## Estate Valuation and Tax Considerations

Patrick's estate, valued at less than $500 in tangible assets, falls well below the threshold requiring federal estate tax filing. However, any future recovery from wrongful death litigation would become an asset of the estate and could have significant tax implications. We recommend establishing a separate accounting system to track litigation expenses and potential recoveries, as the estate may exist for several years pending resolution of legal claims.

The appointment as administrator will require posting a surety bond, typically in an amount equal to the estimated value of the estate plus one year's income. Given the potential for significant litigation recovery, the court may require a bond in excess of the normal calculation. We can assist in obtaining appropriate bonding through established insurance carriers.

## Coordination with Other Affected Families

My office has been contacted by several other families in your neighborhood who have lost children to leukemia, including the Andersons, Kanes, and Robbins families. There may be advantages to coordinating legal strategies, sharing expert witness costs, and presenting a unified front against corporate defendants. However, each estate must be administered separately, and conflicts of interest could arise if settlement offers vary significantly between cases.

The environmental contamination in Woburn appears to be the result of decades of industrial solvent disposal by multiple companies. Identifying all responsible parties, quantifying their respective contributions to the contamination, and establishing their legal liability will require extensive investigation and expert testimony. The complexity of the case suggests that only attorneys with significant environmental litigation experience should be engaged for the wrongful death claims.

## Next Steps

Please contact my office within the next week to schedule an appointment to review and execute the necessary probate court filings. I will prepare the petition for administration, inventory of assets, and supporting documentation for your review and signature. Additionally, I recommend that you begin gathering the medical and residential documentation outlined above, as this information will be crucial for both the probate proceedings and any future litigation.

The loss of Patrick represents not only a personal tragedy for your family but also a potential landmark case in environmental law. While no legal recovery can compensate for the loss of your son, holding responsible parties accountable may prevent similar tragedies and provide some measure of justice for Patrick's suffering.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns regarding these matters. My office stands ready to assist you through this difficult process.

Sincerely,
