# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Beatrice Foods Management  
**FROM:** William J. McCarthy, Riley Tannery Operations Supervisor  
**DATE:** July 9, 1975  
**RE:** Response to Drum Leakage Incident Report - July 7, 1975

## Incident Summary

This memo addresses the drum leakage incident reported on July 7, 1975, at the Riley Tannery facility located at 328 Washington Street, Woburn, Massachusetts. During routine morning inspection at approximately 0630 hours, maintenance staff discovered evidence of chemical leakage from storage drums positioned in the rear yard area adjacent to the Aberjona River tributary. The affected drums contained trichloroethylene (TCE) and other industrial solvents used in our leather processing operations.

## Immediate Actions Taken

Upon discovery of the leakage, I immediately directed maintenance personnel to contain the visible spillage using available absorbent materials and sand barriers. The affected drums were repositioned to minimize further discharge, and the immediate area was cordoned off to prevent personnel exposure. However, given the proximity to the water table and the duration of the apparent leakage—estimated to have occurred over several days based on soil discoloration patterns—some quantity of solvent material has likely migrated beyond the immediate containment area.

## Assessment and Recommendations

The current drum storage configuration, while meeting our immediate operational needs, presents ongoing challenges for containment of industrial chemicals. The rear yard location, selected for its convenience to processing operations, sits on permeable soil approximately 200 yards from the Aberjona River system. Recent heavy rainfall in late June has elevated groundwater levels, potentially accelerating the migration of any released materials toward municipal water sources.

I recommend we continue current containment practices while monitoring the situation for any regulatory inquiries. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering has not yet established specific protocols for this type of incident, and federal oversight remains limited to major industrial facilities. Our legal counsel should be consulted regarding any potential reporting obligations, though no immediate regulatory action appears necessary at this time.

## Operational Continuity

Normal tannery operations will continue without interruption. The affected storage area represents less than 15% of our total chemical storage capacity, and alternative drum positioning has been implemented to maintain production schedules. Staff have been instructed to report any similar incidents immediately and to exercise appropriate caution when handling chemical materials in the rear yard area.
