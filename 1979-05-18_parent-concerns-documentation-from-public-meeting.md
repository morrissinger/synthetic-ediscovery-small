# Letter to Woburn City Health Officer

**May 18, 1979**

Dear Sir,

I am writing to you following last night's public meeting at the Woburn City Hall regarding the recent closure of Wells G and H. As a resident of East Woburn and a mother deeply concerned about the health of my family and neighbors, I feel compelled to document my observations and request immediate action from the city's health department.

My name is Anne Anderson, and I live at 28 Meadow Street with my husband Bruce and our children. We have resided in this neighborhood for several years, and like many families here, we have been entirely dependent on the municipal water supply, including water from the now-closed wells. What I learned at yesterday's meeting has left me profoundly disturbed and fearful for the wellbeing of our community's children.

During the meeting, we were informed that Wells G and H have been found to contain dangerous levels of chemical contamination, including something called trichloroethylene and other industrial solvents. These are the same wells that have been supplying water to our homes since the mid-1960s. The timing of this discovery is particularly troubling to me because I have observed a pattern of serious illnesses among the children in our neighborhood that I believe may be connected to this contamination.

Over the past several years, I have noticed an unusually high number of childhood cancers, particularly leukemia, in East Woburn. My own son Jimmy has been battling leukemia, and I know of at least five other young boys in our immediate area who have been diagnosed with this terrible disease. These include Kevin Kane Jr., whose family lives just a few streets away, Michael Zona, Patrick Toomey, Carl Robbins III, and Roland Gamache. This concentration of childhood leukemia cases in such a small geographic area cannot be a coincidence, especially now that we know our water supply has been contaminated with industrial chemicals.

At the meeting, there was discussion about the industrial facilities in our area, particularly the W.R. Grace Company facility on Washington Street and the old tannery operations. It seems clear that these businesses have been disposing of their chemical wastes in ways that have allowed contamination to reach our groundwater. The Grace facility, where they manufacture packaging equipment, uses large quantities of solvents and other chemicals in their operations. I have lived in this neighborhood long enough to remember when that facility was built and expanded, and I have often noticed chemical odors in the air, particularly during certain weather conditions.

What disturbs me most is that this contamination appears to have been ongoing for years while our children were drinking this water every day. We trusted that the city was providing us with safe water, and we had no way of knowing that dangerous chemicals were flowing through our taps. Our children drank this water, bathed in it, and we used it for cooking and preparing their food. The thought that we may have unknowingly exposed them to cancer-causing chemicals is devastating.

I am writing to request that you take immediate action to investigate the connection between this water contamination and the pattern of childhood illnesses in our neighborhood. We need a comprehensive health study to determine whether there is a link between the contaminated wells and the cases of leukemia and other serious illnesses we have observed. The families affected deserve to know the truth about what has happened to our children and why.

Furthermore, I believe the city has a responsibility to ensure that the companies responsible for this contamination are held accountable. If W.R. Grace, Beatrice Foods, or any other industrial facility has contaminated our water supply through improper disposal of chemical wastes, they must be made to answer for the harm they have caused to our community. The health and safety of our children must take priority over any business interests or concerns about legal complications.

I also request that the city provide immediate medical monitoring and support for all families who have been exposed to this contaminated water, particularly those with children who have developed serious illnesses. We need access to specialists who understand the health effects of chemical exposure, and we need ongoing monitoring to watch for additional health problems that may develop over time.

The families in East Woburn have been living with the consequences of this contamination for years without knowing the cause. We have watched our children suffer from serious illnesses while trusting that our municipal water supply was safe. Now that we know the truth, we expect our local health officials to take decisive action to protect our community and ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.

I look forward to your prompt response and to learning about the specific steps you will take to address this crisis. Please understand that we will not accept delays or bureaucratic excuses while our children's health remains at risk. This situation demands immediate and comprehensive action from all levels of government.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely,

Anne Anderson  
28 Meadow Street  
Woburn, Massachusetts
