# MAINTENANCE INCIDENT REPORT

**TO:** Charles F. Morrison, Facility Supervisor  
**FROM:** Robert M. Henderson, Maintenance Worker  
**DATE:** August 9, 1963  
**RE:** Solvent Storage Area Inspection and Maintenance Issues

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

During routine maintenance inspection of the rear facility grounds on August 8, 1963, I discovered several conditions requiring immediate supervisory attention regarding our solvent storage operations behind Building C. This report documents observed conditions and recommended corrective actions per company maintenance protocols.

## DETAILED FINDINGS

### Storage Container Conditions

Upon inspection of the solvent storage area located approximately 150 feet southeast of Building C, I observed the following conditions:

**Container #1 (55-gallon drum, unmarked):** Visible rust patches along bottom rim with evidence of minor seepage. Dark staining observed in soil directly beneath container extending approximately 2 feet in diameter. Container appears to have been in current location for extended period based on vegetation patterns and soil discoloration.

**Container #2 (55-gallon drum, faded "TCE" marking):** Significant corrosion noted on side wall with active dripping observed during inspection. Pooling of clear liquid noted in depression adjacent to container. Strong chemical odor detected within 10-foot radius of this container.

**Container #3 (Metal storage tank, approximately 100-gallon capacity):** Structural integrity appears compromised with visible crack in lower section. Evidence suggests contents have been seeping into surrounding soil for considerable time period. Ground vegetation within 15-foot radius shows signs of damage or absence.

### Ground Conditions

The soil throughout the storage area shows extensive discoloration consistent with chemical infiltration. Dark patches extend beyond immediate container locations, suggesting subsurface migration of spilled materials. Several areas show complete absence of vegetation in patterns radiating from storage containers.

Water pooling was observed in low-lying areas of the storage zone, with surface water showing visible film and strong chemical odors. This condition appears to be ongoing rather than recent, based on established drainage patterns and soil staining.

## IMMEDIATE CONCERNS

The current storage configuration presents several maintenance and operational challenges:

1. **Container Integrity:** Multiple containers show advanced deterioration requiring immediate attention or replacement.

2. **Soil Contamination:** Extensive ground contamination suggests long-term seepage has occurred without adequate containment measures.

3. **Drainage Issues:** Natural drainage patterns appear to direct contaminated runoff toward the eastern property boundary in the direction of the Aberjona River corridor.

4. **Access and Monitoring:** Current storage location lacks adequate access for routine inspection and maintenance procedures.

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

Based on these observations, I recommend the following maintenance actions be implemented:

**Immediate (Within 48 Hours):**
- Replace or repair compromised containers showing active leakage
- Install temporary containment barriers around affected soil areas
- Remove standing contaminated water from low-lying areas

**Short-term (Within 30 Days):**
- Relocate all solvent storage to designated area with proper containment infrastructure
- Implement regular inspection schedule for all chemical storage containers
- Install drainage controls to prevent runoff migration toward property boundaries

**Long-term Planning:**
- Consider construction of dedicated chemical storage facility with concrete containment
- Develop comprehensive chemical inventory and tracking system
- Establish formal protocols for container maintenance and replacement

## ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS

During the inspection, I noted that the current storage area lacks several standard industrial safety features typically associated with chemical storage operations. No containment berms, drainage controls, or secondary containment systems are currently in place.

The proximity of this storage area to the eastern property boundary and natural drainage patterns toward the Aberjona River corridor suggests that any continued seepage could potentially impact areas beyond our immediate facility grounds.

Weather conditions during the inspection were clear and dry, allowing for comprehensive visual assessment of all containers and ground conditions. Photographic documentation was not taken as per standard maintenance report procedures, but detailed measurements and observations are recorded in maintenance log book #47.

## CONCLUSION

The current condition of our solvent storage area requires immediate supervisory attention and corrective action. While these storage containers have served our operational needs, their current state of deterioration presents ongoing maintenance challenges that should be addressed through systematic upgrade of our chemical storage infrastructure.

I am available to discuss these findings and assist with implementation of recommended corrective measures at your earliest convenience.
