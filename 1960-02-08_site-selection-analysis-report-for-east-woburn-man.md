**TO:** W.R. Grace Executive Committee  
**FROM:** Site Development Team - Industrial Properties Division  
**DATE:** February 8, 1960  
**RE:** Comprehensive Site Analysis - Proposed East Woburn Manufacturing Complex

---

## Executive Summary

The Site Development Team has completed a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed 15-acre industrial site located at 328 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts, for development of our new chemical manufacturing and packaging facility. This analysis encompasses geological surveys, transportation accessibility, utility infrastructure, labor availability, and regulatory compliance factors relevant to our planned operations.

Based on our assessment, we recommend **immediate acquisition** of this property for development of our specialty chemical processing operations. The site offers exceptional advantages including direct railroad access, proximity to major transportation corridors, available industrial workforce, and suitable geological conditions for our manufacturing requirements.

## Site Description and Location Analysis

### Geographic Position
The proposed facility site encompasses 15.2 acres of industrial-zoned land situated in the established manufacturing corridor of East Woburn, Massachusetts. The property is bounded by Salem Street to the north, active Boston & Maine railroad tracks to the west, and extends eastward toward the Aberjona River valley. The site elevation ranges from 95 to 110 feet above sea level, providing natural drainage advantages for industrial operations.

### Transportation Infrastructure
Railroad access represents the primary strategic advantage of this location. The existing Boston & Maine spur line provides direct freight service connections to Boston, Worcester, and northern New England markets. Road access via Salem Street connects to Route 38 within 0.8 miles, offering convenient truck transportation to Interstate highway systems currently under development.

The proximity to Logan International Airport (12 miles southeast) facilitates executive travel and expedited shipping of specialty products to national markets.

### Utility Infrastructure Assessment
Municipal water service is available through existing 8-inch mains along Salem Street, with adequate pressure and flow capacity for our projected industrial requirements. The Woburn Municipal Light Plant can provide electrical service up to 2,000 KVA through existing distribution lines, meeting our initial power requirements with expansion capability.

Natural gas service is available through Boston Gas Company mains, supporting our planned heating and process requirements. Telephone service through New England Telephone Company provides adequate communications infrastructure.

## Geological and Environmental Conditions

### Subsurface Analysis
Geological surveys conducted in October and November 1959 indicate the site consists primarily of glacial till deposits overlying bedrock formations typical of the Middlesex County region. Soil composition includes sandy loam with clay lenses, providing adequate bearing capacity for industrial construction.

Groundwater levels vary seasonally between 8 and 15 feet below surface grade. The natural groundwater flow direction trends northeast toward the Aberjona River system. Percolation rates measured during test boring operations indicate moderate drainage characteristics suitable for industrial waste management systems.

### Topographical Considerations
The site's natural slope toward the northeast facilitates surface drainage and eliminates requirements for extensive grading operations. Existing vegetation consists primarily of secondary growth woodland with no significant environmental constraints identified.

## Regulatory and Zoning Compliance

### Municipal Zoning Status
The property is zoned Industrial-2 under current Woburn zoning ordinances, permitting chemical manufacturing operations without special permits or variances. Setback requirements are satisfied by the proposed facility layout, with adequate buffer zones maintained from residential areas.

### State and Federal Considerations
Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations governing industrial operations have been reviewed. Our planned chemical processing activities fall within standard industrial classifications requiring routine permits and inspections. No federal regulatory constraints have been identified that would restrict our intended operations.

Environmental discharge permits for process wastewater will be obtained through standard Massachusetts Water Pollution Control Division procedures. Initial discussions with state officials indicate no anticipated complications in securing required operating permits.

## Labor Market Analysis

### Workforce Availability
The greater Woburn area maintains a skilled industrial workforce experienced in chemical and manufacturing operations. Local unemployment rates of approximately 4.2% indicate adequate labor availability without creating shortages for existing employers.

### Wage Structure
Prevailing industrial wages in the Woburn area compare favorably with other Massachusetts locations under consideration. Chemical operator positions average $2.85 per hour, with skilled maintenance personnel commanding $3.40-$3.80 per hour. These rates align with our projected labor cost estimates.

## Economic Factors and Cost Analysis

### Land Acquisition Costs
The property owner, Woburn Industrial Properties Trust, has indicated willingness to negotiate sale at $8,500 per acre, totaling approximately $129,200 for the complete 15.2-acre parcel. This price represents favorable terms compared to alternative sites evaluated in Cambridge and Somerville.

### Development Infrastructure Costs
Estimated site preparation costs including grading, utility connections, and access road improvements total $47,000. Construction of our planned 35,000 square foot manufacturing facility with associated storage and administrative buildings is estimated at $285,000, based on current construction costs of $8.15 per square foot for industrial buildings.

### Tax Considerations
Woburn's industrial tax rate of $89.50 per $1,000 assessed valuation compares favorably with surrounding communities. The City of Woburn has indicated willingness to consider tax abatement arrangements for new industrial development, potentially reducing our property tax obligations during initial operational years.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Environmental Considerations
The site's location within an established industrial area minimizes potential conflicts with residential development. Existing manufacturing operations in the vicinity, including the Riley Tannery facility operating since 1909, demonstrate community acceptance of industrial activities.

Natural drainage patterns direct surface runoff toward the Aberjona River system, requiring standard industrial wastewater treatment systems to ensure compliance with state water quality regulations. Our planned treatment facilities will meet or exceed current regulatory requirements.

### Operational Risk Factors
The site's proximity to residential areas necessitates careful attention to noise and odor control measures. Our facility design incorporates appropriate buffer zones and emission control systems to maintain positive community relations.

Transportation access limitations during severe weather conditions represent minimal operational risk given our planned inventory management systems and product storage capabilities.

## Recommendations and Implementation Timeline

### Primary Recommendation
We recommend immediate authorization to proceed with acquisition of the East Woburn site based on the comprehensive advantages identified in this analysis. The combination of transportation access, utility availability, favorable zoning, and competitive acquisition costs makes this property our preferred location for the new chemical manufacturing facility.

### Implementation Schedule
- **March 1960:** Execute purchase agreement and complete property acquisition
- **April-May 1960:** Obtain construction permits and finalize facility design
- **June 1960:** Begin site preparation and construction activities
- **January 1961:** Complete construction and begin equipment installation
- **April 1961:** Commence production operations

### Budget Authorization Request
We request Executive Committee authorization for total project expenditure of $485,000, allocated as follows:
- Land acquisition: $129,200
- Site preparation: $47,000
- Building construction: $285,000
- Contingency reserve: $23,800

## Conclusion

The East Woburn site represents an exceptional opportunity to establish our new chemical manufacturing operations in a location offering significant strategic and economic advantages. The combination of transportation infrastructure, utility availability, regulatory compliance, and acquisition costs makes this property clearly superior to alternative locations evaluated during our site selection process.

We respectfully request Executive Committee approval to proceed with immediate acquisition and development of this facility to support our expanding specialty chemicals business.
