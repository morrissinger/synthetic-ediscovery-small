# Letter to Family About New Home in East Woburn

July 20, 1974

Dear Mom, Dad, and Everyone,

I hope this letter finds you all in good health and spirits. Carl and I wanted to write and tell you about our wonderful new home here in East Woburn. We've been settled in for about six months now, and I can honestly say we couldn't be happier with our decision to move here from Medford.

Our house is located on a quiet residential street, and the neighborhood is just perfect for raising Carl III. There are so many children his age living nearby - it's like a little community within the larger town. The Andersons live just a few streets over with their boy Jimmy, who's about Carl III's age, and there's the Kane family with their son Kevin, and the Toomeys with Patrick. It's wonderful to see Carl III making so many new friends so quickly. The children all play together in the afternoons, riding their bicycles up and down the streets and playing games in each other's yards.

What really drew us to this area was how family-oriented it is. Most of the families moved here in the past decade or so, drawn by the good schools and the reasonable housing prices. The elementary school is excellent, and Carl III is already excited about starting there in the fall. The teachers seem dedicated, and the class sizes are manageable. We feel so fortunate to have found a place where we can give our son such a good start in life.

The house itself is everything we dreamed of when we started looking to move out of the city. It's a lovely colonial with three bedrooms, a nice-sized kitchen where I can cook those Sunday dinners you taught me, Mom, and a basement where Carl can set up his workshop. The yard is perfect for Carl III - plenty of space to run around and play, and I'm already planning a vegetable garden for next spring. The previous owners took excellent care of the property, and we got it at such a reasonable price compared to what we would have paid closer to Boston.

One of the best features is that we have city water service, which means we don't have to worry about maintaining a well like some of our friends in other towns. The water pressure is excellent, and the water tastes fresh and clean - much better than what we had in our old apartment. Carl jokes that it's so good, we might never need to buy bottled water again! The city opened some new wells a few years back to serve this growing area, and the service has been reliable.

The neighborhood has such a sense of community too. Just last weekend, the Andersons had a barbecue in their backyard, and several families came over. Anne Anderson is such a lovely woman - she's originally from California, and she has such interesting stories about life out west. Her husband Jerome works hard to provide for their family, just like Carl does for us. It's nice to have neighbors you can really talk to and rely on.

We're also close enough to everything we need - the grocery store, the pharmacy, and Carl's work. His commute is actually shorter now than it was from Medford, which means more time at home with the family. On Sundays, we've been taking walks around the neighborhood, and Carl III loves looking at all the different houses and meeting the other families. There's something special about this place - you can just feel that it's going to be a wonderful place to raise children.

I know you were worried, Mom, about us moving further away, but it's really not that far, and we'd love to have you visit soon. I think you'd be impressed with how nice everything is here. The air is cleaner than in the city, and it's so much quieter at night. Carl III sleeps so much better here than he did in our old place.

The other families have been so welcoming. Joan Zona, who lives over on Montvale Road, brought us a casserole our first week, and she's been such a help in getting us oriented to the area. She has several children, and her youngest, Michael, is just the sweetest little boy. He and Carl III have become fast friends already. It's families like the Zonas that make this neighborhood feel like home.

We're planning to have everyone over for a housewarming party in August, maybe the weekend of the 17th if that works for everyone's schedule. I know it's a bit of a drive from the old neighborhood, but I think you'll see why we fell in love with this place. Carl can give the men a tour of his new workshop, and I'll show you ladies my kitchen and the garden space.

Carl III asks about his grandparents every day, and he's so excited to show you his new room and introduce you to all his new friends. He's really thriving here - getting plenty of fresh air and exercise, making friends, and just being a normal, healthy, active boy. We feel so blessed to have found this perfect place to call home.

Please give our love to everyone, and let us know when you can come visit. We can't wait to show you around East Woburn and introduce you to all our wonderful new neighbors.

All our love,

Donna

P.S. - Carl says to tell Dad that the basement is perfect for his woodworking, and there's even space for Dad to set up his tools when he visits!
