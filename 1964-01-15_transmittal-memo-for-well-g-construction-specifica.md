# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Thomas J. Sullivan, Director, Department of Public Works  
**FROM:** Robert F. McKenzie, City Engineer  
**DATE:** January 15, 1964  
**RE:** Transmittal of Well G Construction Specifications for Final Review

Tom,

Please find attached the complete construction specifications and engineering drawings for Well G, which we are planning to bring online within the next two weeks. As discussed in our December meeting, this new well will provide supplemental water capacity for the eastern section of our service area, particularly during peak summer demand periods when our existing Wells A and B approach their maximum sustainable yield.

The well has been drilled to a depth of 88 feet and is positioned approximately 200 yards east of the Aberjona River, near the intersection of Salem Street and the railroad right-of-way. Initial flow tests conducted by Hartwell Engineering indicate a sustainable yield of 400 gallons per minute, which should provide adequate supplemental capacity for the East Woburn neighborhoods. The well casing specifications meet all current Massachusetts Department of Public Health requirements, with 12-inch steel casing extending to 85 feet and a concrete seal at the surface level to prevent surface contamination.

I want to bring to your attention that during the drilling process, our contractors noted some unusual soil conditions in the 40-60 foot depth range. The soil samples showed some discoloration and what appeared to be industrial residue, though this is not uncommon given the industrial development in the Aberjona River valley over the past several decades. The State Health Department inspector, Mr. Harold Peterson, reviewed these conditions during his site visit on December 18th and determined that the well construction and sealing procedures would adequately protect the water supply from any surface or near-surface contamination sources.

Water quality testing has been completed by the State laboratory, and all parameters meet current drinking water standards. The bacteriological tests show no contamination, and chemical analysis indicates water quality comparable to our existing wells. The only notable finding was slightly elevated levels of certain organic compounds, but these remain well within acceptable limits established by the Department of Public Health. Mr. Peterson indicated that such readings are typical for wells in areas with industrial activity and pose no health concerns.

I recommend we proceed with connecting Well G to the distribution system as planned. The electrical work for the pump house is scheduled for completion by January 25th, and we should be able to begin regular operation by February 1st. This will allow us to reduce the strain on Wells A and B, which have been operating at near-capacity during recent months due to increased residential development in the Pine Street and Forest Street areas.

Please review the attached specifications and let me know if you have any questions or concerns before we finalize the connection to the main distribution line.
