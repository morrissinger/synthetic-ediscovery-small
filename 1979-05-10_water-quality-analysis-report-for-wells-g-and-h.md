# WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS REPORT
## WELLS G AND H
### WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT LABORATORY

---

**Report Number:** WQA-79-0510-GH  
**Date of Analysis:** May 10, 1979  
**Time of Completion:** 4:30 PM  
**Laboratory Supervisor:** Dr. Margaret E. Sullivan, Ph.D.  
**Testing Technician:** Robert J. McMahon  
**Sample Collection Date:** May 8, 1979  
**Sample Collection Time:** 9:15 AM (Well G), 9:45 AM (Well H)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis conducted on water samples collected from municipal Wells G and H located in East Woburn. Testing was performed in accordance with EPA Method 601 for purgeable halocarbons and EPA Method 602 for purgeable aromatics. **Critical contamination levels have been detected in both wells, requiring immediate remedial action.**

## SAMPLE IDENTIFICATION

**Well G Sample:**
- Sample ID: WG-790508-001
- Location: Municipal Well G, Pine Street vicinity
- GPS Coordinates: 42°29'15"N, 71°09'30"W (approximate)
- Well Depth: 180 feet
- Aquifer: Glacial outwash deposits
- Collection Method: Direct tap sampling after 10-minute purge

**Well H Sample:**
- Sample ID: WH-790508-002  
- Location: Municipal Well H, East Woburn Industrial Area
- GPS Coordinates: 42°29'05"N, 71°09'15"W (approximate)
- Well Depth: 165 feet
- Aquifer: Glacial outwash deposits
- Collection Method: Direct tap sampling after 10-minute purge

## ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGY

Analysis was conducted using gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) and mass spectrometry confirmation (GC-MS) for compound identification. Samples were processed using purge and trap concentration techniques with thermal desorption onto Tenax-GC columns.

**Quality Control Measures:**
- Blank samples analyzed concurrently
- Standard reference materials used for calibration
- Duplicate analyses performed on 20% of samples
- Chain of custody maintained throughout process

## ANALYTICAL RESULTS

### Well G Results

| Compound | Concentration (µg/L) | Detection Limit (µg/L) | EPA MCL (µg/L) | Status |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|---------|
| Trichloroethylene (TCE) | **267** | 0.5 | 5.0 | **EXCEEDS MCL** |
| Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) | **21** | 0.5 | 5.0 | **EXCEEDS MCL** |
| 1,1,1-Trichloroethane | 8.3 | 0.5 | 200 | Below MCL |
| Chloroform | 3.2 | 0.5 | 100 | Below MCL |
| Trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene | 12 | 0.5 | 100 | Below MCL |
| Benzene | 2.1 | 0.5 | 5.0 | Below MCL |
| Toluene | 1.8 | 0.5 | 1000 | Below MCL |

### Well H Results

| Compound | Concentration (µg/L) | Detection Limit (µg/L) | EPA MCL (µg/L) | Status |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|---------|
| Trichloroethylene (TCE) | **183** | 0.5 | 5.0 | **EXCEEDS MCL** |
| Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) | **56** | 0.5 | 5.0 | **EXCEEDS MCL** |
| 1,1,1-Trichloroethane | 15 | 0.5 | 200 | Below MCL |
| Chloroform | 7.8 | 0.5 | 100 | Below MCL |
| Trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene | 28 | 0.5 | 100 | Below MCL |
| Benzene | 4.2 | 0.5 | 5.0 | Below MCL |
| Methylene Chloride | 3.5 | 0.5 | 5.0 | Below MCL |

## DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS

The analytical results reveal severe contamination of both municipal wells with chlorinated organic solvents, particularly trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. Trichloroethylene concentrations exceed EPA Maximum Contaminant Levels by factors of 53.4 (Well G) and 36.6 (Well H). Tetrachloroethylene levels exceed standards by factors of 4.2 (Well G) and 11.2 (Well H).

The presence of these industrial solvents in municipal water supplies indicates contamination from industrial sources. The compound profile suggests multiple contamination sources, as evidenced by the varying ratios of different chlorinated compounds between the two wells.

**Temporal Analysis:**
Historical records indicate Wells G and H have been in continuous operation since 1964 and 1966 respectively. Previous testing conducted in 1975 showed no detectable levels of organic compounds, suggesting contamination has occurred within the past four years or that previous testing methodology was insufficient to detect these compounds at lower concentrations.

**Hydrogeological Considerations:**
Both wells draw from the same glacial outwash aquifer system in the Aberjona River Valley. The contamination pattern suggests groundwater plume migration from upgradient industrial sources. Well H shows higher tetrachloroethylene levels, while Well G shows higher trichloroethylene concentrations, indicating potentially different source areas or contamination timing.

## HEALTH IMPLICATIONS

Trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are classified as probable human carcinogens by the EPA. Chronic exposure to these compounds has been associated with:

- Central nervous system effects
- Liver and kidney damage  
- Reproductive effects
- Increased cancer risk

The detected concentrations represent significant public health concerns, particularly for vulnerable populations including children, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

All analytical procedures followed EPA-approved methods. Laboratory blanks showed no contamination. Duplicate analyses agreed within 15% for all compounds detected above 10 µg/L. Standard reference materials were within acceptable recovery ranges (85-115%).

**Laboratory Certification:** Massachusetts Department of Public Health Laboratory Certification #L-0089

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Well Closure:** Both Wells G and H should be removed from service immediately pending remedial action.

2. **Alternative Water Supply:** Emergency interconnection with adjacent municipal systems should be established to maintain water service to affected areas.

3. **Extended Monitoring:** Comprehensive monitoring program should be implemented to assess contamination extent and track remedial progress.

4. **Source Investigation:** Immediate investigation of potential industrial contamination sources should be initiated in coordination with state environmental authorities.

5. **Public Notification:** Affected residents should be notified of contamination findings and provided with alternative water supplies as necessary.

6. **Health Assessment:** Coordination with Massachusetts Department of Public Health to assess potential health impacts on exposed populations.
