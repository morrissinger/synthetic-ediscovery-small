### ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEY REPORT

**Survey Report No.:** WSD-79-0522-EW  
**Site Location:** Municipal Wells G and H, East Woburn, Massachusetts  
**Survey Date:** May 15-22, 1979  
**Report Date:** May 22, 1979  
**Principal Investigator:** Robert K. Sullivan, P.E., Environmental Engineer  
**Field Team:** Margaret Chen, Chemist; David R. Morrison, Hydrogeologist

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This environmental survey was conducted in response to routine volatile organic compound (VOC) testing of municipal water supply Wells G and H in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Testing revealed significant concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE) and other industrial solvents in both wells, necessitating immediate closure of the water sources and comprehensive environmental assessment.

**Key Findings:**
- Well G: TCE concentration of 267 parts per billion (ppb)
- Well H: TCE concentration of 21 ppb
- Additional detection of tetrachloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethylene, and chloroform
- Contamination levels exceed EPA proposed drinking water standards
- Immediate public health risk identified

**Recommendations:**
- Immediate permanent closure of Wells G and H
- Comprehensive groundwater contamination assessment
- Source identification investigation
- Public health notification and alternative water supply provision

## SITE DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND

### Location and Geology

Wells G and H are located in the Aberjona River Valley in East Woburn, Massachusetts, approximately 12 miles northwest of Boston. Well G (coordinates: 42°30'15"N, 71°08'42"W) was constructed in 1964 and is located at Pine Street near the Aberjona River. Well H (coordinates: 42°30'28"N, 71°08'35"W) was constructed in 1966 and is situated approximately 1,300 feet northeast of Well G.

The wells tap into an unconfined sand and gravel aquifer within the Aberjona River Valley glacial deposits. The aquifer consists primarily of medium to coarse sand with gravel lenses, overlain by 10-15 feet of organic-rich silt and clay. Groundwater flow is generally from north to south, following the valley topography toward the Mystic River drainage system.

### Operational History

Both wells have operated continuously since their construction, providing supplemental water supply to the East Woburn distribution system. Combined capacity is approximately 2.5 million gallons per day, serving an estimated 5,000 residents in the eastern sections of Woburn. The wells operate under Massachusetts Department of Public Health permits WS-64-107 (Well G) and WS-66-143 (Well H).

### Industrial Context

The Aberjona River Valley contains several industrial facilities that utilize organic solvents in their manufacturing processes:

1. **W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc.** - 369 Washington Street, approximately 1,500 feet northeast of Well G. Facility manufactures food packaging equipment and utilizes trichloroethylene, methylene chloride, and other solvents for degreasing operations.

2. **Beatrice Foods/John J. Riley Tannery** - 228 Salem Street, approximately 2,000 feet southwest of Well H. Historical tanning operations utilizing chromium compounds and organic solvents.

3. **Unifirst Corporation** - Industrial laundry facility utilizing perchloroethylene and other cleaning solvents.

## METHODOLOGY

### Sampling Protocol

Water samples were collected from Wells G and H using EPA-approved sampling procedures for volatile organic compounds. Samples were collected directly from well heads prior to any treatment or chlorination. All samples were preserved with hydrochloric acid and maintained at 4°C during transport to the laboratory.

**Sampling Details:**
- Well G: May 15, 1979, 0800 hours
- Well H: May 15, 1979, 1030 hours
- Duplicate samples collected for quality assurance
- Chain of custody procedures followed

### Analytical Methods

Analysis was performed by the Massachusetts State Laboratory using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) according to EPA Method 624 for purgeable organics in water. Detection limits for individual compounds ranged from 1-5 ppb.

**Target Analytes:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE)
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE)
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane
- 1,2-Dichloroethylene
- Vinyl chloride
- Chloroform
- Carbon tetrachloride
- Methylene chloride

### Quality Assurance

Laboratory quality control included analysis of method blanks, duplicate samples, and spiked samples. All results met EPA quality assurance criteria with relative percent differences less than 20% for duplicate analyses.

## RESULTS AND FINDINGS

### Chemical Analysis Results

**Well G (Sample Date: May 15, 1979)**

| Compound | Concentration (ppb) | Detection Limit (ppb) | EPA Proposed Standard (ppb) |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Trichloroethylene | 267 | 1 | 100 |
| Tetrachloroethylene | 5.7 | 1 | 100 |
| 1,2-Dichloroethylene | 3.2 | 2 | Not established |

**Well H (Sample Date: May 15, 1979)**

| Compound | Concentration (ppb) | Detection Limit (ppb) | EPA Proposed Standard (ppb) |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Trichloroethylene | 21 | 1 | 100 |
| Tetrachloroethylene | 1.8 | 1 | 100 |
| 1,2-Dichloroethylene | <2 | 2 | Not established |
| Chloroform | 8.7 | 1 | 100 |
| 1,1,1-Trichloroethane | <1 | 1 | Not established |
| Vinyl chloride | <1 | 1 | 10 |
| Carbon tetrachloride | <1 | 1 | Not established |
| Methylene chloride | <5 | 5 | Not established |

### Hydrogeological Assessment

Preliminary groundwater flow analysis indicates that contamination sources are likely located upgradient (north) of the well field. The presence of multiple chlorinated solvents suggests industrial sources rather than single-point contamination.

Groundwater flow direction is consistent with surface topography, flowing generally south-southeast at an estimated velocity of 0.5-1.0 feet per day based on hydraulic conductivity estimates of 100-200 feet per day and hydraulic gradients of 0.005-0.01.

## HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT

### Regulatory Standards

The detected trichloroethylene concentrations in Well G (267 ppb) exceed the EPA proposed National Interim Primary Drinking Water Regulation of 100 ppb by a factor of 2.67. While Well H concentrations (21 ppb) are below this proposed standard, the presence of multiple chlorinated compounds raises concerns about cumulative health effects.

### Exposure Pathways

Primary exposure pathway is ingestion of contaminated drinking water by residents served by the East Woburn distribution system. Secondary pathways include inhalation during showering and household water use.
