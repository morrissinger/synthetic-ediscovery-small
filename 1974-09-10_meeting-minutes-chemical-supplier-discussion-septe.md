## AGENDA ITEMS DISCUSSED

### 1. Current Chemical Inventory and Supplier Relations

**Discussion:** Plant Manager Sullivan opened the meeting by reviewing current chemical inventory levels and supplier performance. He noted that our primary suppliers—including W.R. Grace Company and associated chemical distributors—have been reliable in meeting our tannery processing requirements. The plant currently maintains adequate stocks of chromium compounds, sulfuric acid, and various organic solvents necessary for leather processing operations.

**Key Points:**
- Monthly chemical consumption averaging 2,400 gallons of mixed solvents
- Chromium compound usage steady at 180 drums per quarter
- Supplier pricing remains competitive despite recent market fluctuations

### 2. Waste Disposal Procedures and Cost Management

**Discussion:** Operations Supervisor McCarthy presented current waste disposal practices and associated costs. He emphasized that our established disposal methods on company property continue to provide the most cost-effective solution for managing chemical byproducts from tannery operations. The rear property area designated for waste management has adequate capacity for current disposal volumes.

McCarthy noted that alternative disposal methods, including contracted waste hauling services, would significantly increase operational costs without providing measurable benefits to plant efficiency. He recommended continuing current practices while monitoring disposal area capacity.

**Decisions Made:**
- Continue current on-site disposal procedures for liquid chemical wastes
- Maintain existing disposal area behind main plant building
- Monitor monthly disposal volumes to ensure adequate site capacity

### 3. Regulatory Compliance and Documentation

**Discussion:** Chemical Procurement Specialist DiMarco reported on recent communications with state environmental officials regarding industrial waste management requirements. He noted that current regulations provide flexibility for established industrial operations to manage waste disposal according to standard industry practices.

DiMarco emphasized that our documentation procedures adequately track chemical purchases and usage patterns. He recommended maintaining current record-keeping systems while ensuring all disposal activities remain within established company property boundaries.

**Key Compliance Points:**
- Chemical purchase records maintained in accordance with standard practices
- Disposal activities conducted exclusively on company-owned property
- No external regulatory filings required under current operational parameters

### 4. Operational Efficiency and Future Planning

**Discussion:** The group reviewed overall plant efficiency metrics and discussed potential improvements to chemical handling procedures. Plant Manager Sullivan noted that current operations maintain productivity targets while managing costs effectively.

The discussion included consideration of equipment maintenance schedules and chemical storage optimization. All attendees agreed that existing procedures support efficient plant operations without requiring significant modifications.

**Action Items Identified:**
- Review chemical storage area organization by October 15, 1974
- Update supplier contact information for emergency procurement needs
- Schedule quarterly review of disposal area capacity utilization

### 5. Budget Considerations and Cost Control

**Discussion:** Administrative review of chemical procurement and disposal costs revealed that current practices maintain budget compliance. The group noted that on-site waste management provides substantial cost savings compared to external disposal services.

Plant Manager Sullivan emphasized the importance of maintaining cost-effective operations while meeting production requirements. He noted that current disposal methods support both operational efficiency and budget objectives.

**Financial Summary Points:**
- Chemical procurement costs within approved budget parameters
- Disposal cost savings estimated at $1,200 per month compared to external services
- No anticipated increases in chemical-related operational expenses
