### AGENDA ITEM 3: EAST WOBURN FACILITY EXPANSION PROPOSAL

**Chairman Grace** called for discussion regarding the proposed expansion of chemical processing operations in East Woburn, Massachusetts, specifically the acquisition of additional property adjacent to our existing Cryovac division facilities.

**Vice President Brady** presented the operational assessment, noting that the East Woburn location provides excellent access to both rail and highway transportation networks. The site offers approximately 15 acres of undeveloped land immediately west of the current Cryovac manufacturing complex on Salem Street. Brady emphasized that the property's proximity to existing infrastructure would minimize capital expenditure for utilities and waste management systems.

**Dr. Steinberg** outlined the technical requirements for the proposed chemical processing expansion, specifically noting the need for adequate solvent storage and disposal capabilities. He indicated that the new facility would primarily handle trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) for degreasing operations supporting the expanded Cryovac production lines. Steinberg estimated that the facility would process approximately 2,000 gallons of industrial solvents monthly, with waste disposal handled through existing on-site methods.

**Discussion ensued** regarding waste management protocols. General Counsel Morrison inquired about regulatory compliance requirements. Dr. Steinberg responded that current Massachusetts industrial regulations permit on-site disposal of chemical waste through approved methods, including subsurface disposal systems. He noted that the sandy soil composition in the East Woburn area provides excellent drainage characteristics that would facilitate waste absorption.

**Vice President Adams** presented the financial analysis, projecting a total capital investment of $850,000 for land acquisition, facility construction, and equipment installation. He estimated that the expanded operations would generate additional annual revenue of $1.2 million within three years of completion.

**Chairman Grace** raised concerns about potential future regulatory changes affecting chemical manufacturing operations. General Counsel Morrison assured the committee that W.R. Grace maintains comprehensive legal compliance and that the proposed facility would meet all current environmental standards. He noted that the company's existing relationships with local authorities in Woburn have been cooperative and productive.

**Vice President Brady** added that the East Woburn site selection aligns with the company's broader strategy of consolidating chemical processing operations in established industrial zones. He noted that the area already hosts several chemical manufacturing facilities, including operations by other major corporations, creating a favorable regulatory environment for industrial activities.

### COMMITTEE DECISIONS

**MOTION:** Vice President Adams moved to approve the acquisition of the East Woburn property and authorization of up to $850,000 for facility development, contingent upon satisfactory completion of due diligence regarding property title and environmental conditions.

**SECOND:** Dr. Steinberg seconded the motion.

**DISCUSSION:** General Counsel Morrison recommended that the company conduct a basic environmental assessment of the property, focusing on soil composition and drainage characteristics to ensure optimal waste disposal efficiency. He suggested that such assessment would also provide documentation of baseline conditions for corporate records.

**AMENDMENT:** Chairman Grace proposed amending the motion to include authorization for environmental assessment not to exceed $15,000 in additional costs.

**VOTE:** Motion as amended carried unanimously (7-0).

He emphasized that the facility would incorporate the most efficient waste management practices available, ensuring both operational effectiveness and community responsibility.

**Vice President Brady** reported that preliminary discussions with Woburn municipal authorities have been positive, with local officials expressing support for continued industrial development that provides employment opportunities for area residents.
