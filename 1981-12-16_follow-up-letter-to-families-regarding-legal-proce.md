# Personal Letter

December 16, 1981

Dear Anne,

I hope this letter finds you and your family managing as well as can be expected during this difficult holiday season. I know that the approaching anniversary of James's passing weighs heavily on all of us, and I wanted to reach out to update you on the progress we've made in our investigation and to discuss the next steps in pursuing justice for James and the other children who have been affected by this contamination.

Since we last spoke in November, my team and I have been working tirelessly to build the strongest possible case against the companies responsible for poisoning Woburn's water supply. I want you to know that every day we spend on this investigation, every document we review, every expert we consult, brings us closer to holding these corporations accountable for what they did to James and to your community. The evidence we've uncovered continues to paint a disturbing picture of corporate negligence and environmental recklessness that spans decades.

Our environmental consultants have now completed their preliminary analysis of the contamination plume extending from the industrial sites on the Aberjona River toward Wells G and H. The data confirms what we suspected: trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene have been migrating through the groundwater for years, likely originating from the W.R. Grace facility on Olympia Avenue and potentially from other industrial operations in the area. The concentrations we're seeing in the well water samples are staggering—levels that no family should ever have been exposed to, especially not through their municipal drinking water supply. What makes this even more unconscionable is that these companies knew, or should have known, about the dangers of these chemicals and the potential for groundwater contamination from their disposal practices.

I've been in contact with the other families affected by this tragedy, including the Kanes, the Zonas, the Toomeys, the Robbins, and the Gamaches. Each family's story adds another layer to our understanding of the scope of this contamination and its devastating impact on your community. Kevin Kane Jr., Michael Zona, Patrick Toomey, Carl Robbins III, and Roland Gamache—these children, like James, deserved to grow up in a safe environment, drinking clean water, pursuing their dreams. Instead, they became victims of corporate indifference to public health and environmental protection.

The legal challenges ahead of us are significant, Anne. Toxic tort cases like this one are complex and expensive, requiring extensive scientific evidence, expert testimony, and years of litigation. We'll be going up against some of the largest corporations in America—W.R. Grace, Beatrice Foods, and their subsidiaries—companies with virtually unlimited resources and teams of lawyers dedicated to avoiding responsibility for their actions. They will argue that the connection between the contaminated water and the childhood leukemia cases cannot be proven, that other factors might be responsible, that their disposal practices met the standards of the time. But I want you to know that we are prepared for this fight, and we will not be intimidated by their wealth or their legal tactics.

I've been consulting with epidemiologists and environmental health experts who specialize in the health effects of chemical exposure, particularly in children. The scientific literature on trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene is growing, and while the companies will try to downplay the risks, the evidence increasingly points to these solvents as carcinogens capable of causing leukemia and other cancers. We're also working with hydrogeologists to map the contamination plume and establish the timeline of when these chemicals reached Wells G and H. This technical evidence will be crucial in demonstrating that the companies' disposal practices directly resulted in the contamination that poisoned your water supply.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has been cooperative in sharing their data on the leukemia cluster in East Woburn, though I suspect they would prefer this issue to remain quiet rather than face scrutiny of their own response to the contamination. The EPA's involvement has been helpful in documenting the extent of the groundwater contamination, but their regulatory response has been frustratingly slow. It's clear that if we want justice for James and the other children, we cannot rely solely on government agencies—we must pursue this through the courts.

I want to be completely honest with you about what lies ahead. This litigation will likely take several years to resolve, and it will require a significant financial investment on our part before we see any recovery. The defendants will use every legal maneuver available to delay and complicate the proceedings, hoping to wear us down or force us to accept an inadequate settlement. There will be times when the process feels overwhelming, when the technical details seem impenetrable, when the companies' denials and deflections make you question whether justice is possible. But I need you to know that my commitment to this case goes beyond the legal fees or any potential settlement—this is about ensuring that no other family has to endure what you've been through.

The discovery process will be particularly challenging, as we'll need to obtain internal documents from these companies dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, when their disposal practices began contaminating the groundwater. We expect them to claim that many documents have been lost or destroyed, and they'll fight to keep their internal communications and environmental studies confidential. However, we have strategies for compelling disclosure, and I'm confident that we'll uncover evidence of their knowledge about the risks their activities posed to the community.

As we move into 1982, I'll be filing the formal complaint against W.R. Grace, Beatrice Foods, and the other defendants. This will mark the official beginning of what I expect to be a landmark environmental lawsuit—one that could establish important precedents for corporate accountability in cases of groundwater contamination. The legal theories we're pursuing include negligence, nuisance, and strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities. We're also exploring claims against the City of Woburn for their failure to adequately monitor and protect the municipal water supply.

Anne, I know that no legal victory can bring James back or undo the suffering your family has endured. But what we can do is ensure that his death was not in vain—that it leads to accountability, compensation, and changes that will protect other children from similar tragedies. The companies responsible for this contamination must be held accountable not just for the environmental damage they caused, but for the human lives they destroyed through their reckless disregard for public health.

Please know that you and your family remain in my thoughts and prayers as we approach the holiday season and the difficult anniversary ahead. James's courage in his battle against leukemia, and your strength in seeking justice for him, inspire me every day to continue this fight. I'll be in touch after the New Year with updates on our progress and to discuss the next steps in the litigation.

If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call me at my office. My secretary, Kathy, has been instructed to put your calls through immediately, regardless of what I'm doing. This case is my top priority, and you deserve to have direct access to information about its progress.

With my deepest respect and commitment to justice for James,

Jan Schlichtmann
