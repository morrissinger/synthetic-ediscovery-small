## Interview Summary

### Family History and Residence

Patricia and Robert Kane moved to 42 Salem Street in March 1964, two years before Kevin Jr. was born. Patricia was pregnant with Kevin during the summer of 1965, when Wells G and H were already operational and supplying water to their neighborhood. The family has three children total: Kevin Jr. (deceased), Susan (born 1963), and Michael (born 1969).

Patricia recalls that Kevin was a healthy baby initially. "He was always smaller than the other children, but the doctor said some babies are just petite," she noted. The family used municipal water for all household needs - drinking, cooking, bathing, and formula preparation when Kevin was an infant.

### Onset of Illness

In early 1973, Patricia noticed Kevin was becoming increasingly tired and pale. "He would come home from school and just collapse on the couch. His teacher, Mrs. Morrison at the Altavela Elementary, called me several times about Kevin falling asleep in class." 

Kevin began experiencing frequent nosebleeds in April 1973. "They weren't little nosebleeds - they were gushers that would last for twenty, thirty minutes. I'd have to take him to the emergency room at Winchester Hospital twice in one week."

**First Medical Consultation:** April 28, 1973 - Dr. Samuel Richardson, pediatrician  
**Initial Symptoms Reported:** Fatigue, pallor, frequent nosebleeds, bruising easily  
**Blood Work Ordered:** May 2, 1973  

### Diagnosis and Treatment

Dr. Richardson called the Kane family on May 7, 1973, requesting they come to his office immediately. Patricia remembers the conversation: "He said Kevin's white blood cell count was extremely high and that we needed to see a specialist right away."

**Referral:** Dr. Michael Weinstein, pediatric hematologist-oncologist, Children's Hospital Boston  
**Confirmation of Diagnosis:** May 11, 1973 - Acute lymphocytic leukemia  
**Initial Prognosis:** "Dr. Weinstein told us that with treatment, Kevin had about a 50-50 chance. In 1973, that seemed like good odds for leukemia."

### Treatment History

Kevin underwent intensive chemotherapy treatment from May 1973 through August 1981. The treatment protocol included:

- **Induction Phase:** May-August 1973 (hospitalized 6 weeks)
- **Maintenance Therapy:** September 1973-June 1978 (monthly treatments)
- **First Relapse:** July 1978 (age 12)
- **Second Treatment Protocol:** August 1978-December 1979
- **Second Relapse:** January 1980 (age 13)
- **Experimental Treatment:** February 1980-May 1981
- **Final Hospitalization:** June 1981-September 1981

Patricia maintained detailed records of Kevin's treatment, including medication schedules, hospital visits, and side effects. "I wrote everything down. Every pill, every appointment, every blood count. I thought if I kept perfect records, somehow that would help him get better."

### Impact on Family

The illness created significant financial strain. Robert Kane worked as a machinist at General Electric in Lynn, earning approximately $18,000 annually in 1973. Medical expenses not covered by insurance totaled over $47,000 by 1981.

"We took out a second mortgage on the house in 1976," Robert explained. "Patricia had to quit her job at Jordan Marsh to take care of Kevin full-time. Between the medical bills and losing her income, we were barely keeping our heads above water."

Kevin's siblings also suffered. Susan, three years older, took on responsibilities caring for her younger brother Michael while their parents focused on Kevin's treatment. "Susan missed out on a lot of normal teenage activities. She was basically a second mother to Michael," Patricia observed.

### Water Usage and Awareness

The Kane family was unaware of any water contamination issues until 1979, when neighbors began discussing unusual numbers of childhood illnesses in the area. Patricia recalls: "Mrs. Anderson down on Orange Street mentioned that her James had leukemia too, and that got me thinking about whether there might be a connection."

The family consumed municipal water exclusively from 1964-1981. Patricia estimates they used approximately 200-300 gallons per week for all household purposes. Kevin consumed significant quantities of tap water, particularly during his illness when he experienced frequent dehydration from chemotherapy treatments.

"The doctors always said to keep him hydrated. I was giving him glass after glass of water, never knowing..." Patricia's voice trailed off during the interview.

### Final Illness and Death

Kevin's condition deteriorated rapidly in summer 1981. Despite experimental treatments at Children's Hospital, his leukemia became resistant to all available therapies.

**Final Hospitalization:** June 15, 1981  
**Last Day at Home:** June 14, 1981  
**Date of Death:** September 14, 1981, 3:47 AM  
**Place of Death:** Children's Hospital Boston, Room 8-West-14  
**Cause of Death:** Acute lymphocytic leukemia with complications from pneumonia  

Patricia was holding Kevin's hand when he died. "He just looked at me and said, 'Mom, I'm tired.' Those were his last words. He was fifteen years old and had been fighting for eight years. He was so tired."

### Conscious Pain and Suffering

Throughout his illness, Kevin experienced significant physical and emotional suffering:

- **Physical symptoms:** Severe nausea from chemotherapy, painful bone marrow aspirations (performed monthly), hair loss, extreme fatigue, frequent infections due to compromised immune system
- **Emotional impact:** Missing school for extended periods, inability to participate in normal childhood activities, awareness of his mortality (particularly after age 12)
- **Social isolation:** Limited contact with peers due to infection risk, inability to attend school functions or sports events

Patricia noted: "Kevin knew he was dying, especially in the last two years. He would ask me why this happened to him, why he couldn't be normal like other kids. How do you explain that to a thirteen-year-old?"

### Damages and Losses

**Medical Expenses (1973-1981):**
- Hospital costs: $89,400
- Physician fees: $12,600  
- Medications: $8,900
- Transportation to Boston: $3,200
- **Total out-of-pocket costs:** $47,300 (after insurance)

**Lost Income:**
- Patricia's lost wages (1973-1981): $52,000
- Robert's lost wages (sick days, medical appointments): $8,400

**Funeral Expenses:** $3,800

**Intangible Losses:**
- Loss of Kevin's future earning capacity
- Loss of companionship and society
- Emotional distress to family members
- Kevin's conscious pain and suffering over 8+ years
