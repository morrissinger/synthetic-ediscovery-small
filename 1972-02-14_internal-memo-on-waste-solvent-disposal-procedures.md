# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Plant Manager, Cryovac Division  
**FROM:** Frank Morrison, Production Supervisor  
**DATE:** February 14, 1972  
**RE:** Current Waste Solvent Disposal Procedures and Operational Efficiency

## Current Disposal Operations

As requested in your memo of February 8th, I am providing an update on our current waste solvent disposal procedures at the Woburn facility. Our production operations continue to generate significant quantities of waste solvents, primarily trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), from our cleaning and degreasing operations in Buildings 1 and 3.

Current disposal volumes average approximately 200-300 gallons per week of mixed waste solvents. The majority of this waste consists of spent TCE from our film cleaning operations and PCE from parts degreasing. Under our existing procedures, waste solvents are collected in 55-gallon drums and temporarily stored in the rear yard area behind Building 2. When storage capacity reaches approximately 15-20 drums, we arrange for disposal through our established ground disposal method on the property.

## Operational Considerations

The current disposal system has proven both cost-effective and operationally efficient. Ground disposal on our property eliminates the recurring expense of off-site waste removal services, which were previously costing the division approximately $800-1,200 monthly. The disposal area, located in the wooded section of our property approximately 400 feet northeast of the main production buildings, provides adequate capacity for our current waste generation rates.

Our maintenance crew has established standard procedures for the disposal operations, typically conducted on Friday afternoons when production activity is reduced. The process involves excavating shallow trenches approximately 3-4 feet in depth, emptying the accumulated drum contents, and covering with soil from the excavation. This method ensures minimal disruption to production schedules while maintaining cost controls that support division profitability targets.

## Regulatory Environment

Recent discussions with corporate legal regarding Massachusetts environmental regulations suggest that current disposal methods remain within acceptable industrial practices. The state has not implemented specific restrictions on on-site industrial waste disposal for facilities of our size and classification. Our legal department has advised that maintaining documentation of disposal activities, while not required, represents prudent business practice.

I have initiated a simple log system to track disposal dates, approximate volumes, and general waste composition. This documentation should provide adequate records for any future regulatory inquiries while requiring minimal administrative overhead. The log is maintained in my office and updated following each disposal operation.

## Recommendations

I recommend continuation of current disposal procedures, which effectively balance operational efficiency with cost control. The existing system supports our production requirements without compromising delivery schedules or quality standards. Ground disposal on company property provides the most economical solution while maintaining operational flexibility.

Should you require additional details regarding specific aspects of our waste management operations, please contact me at extension 247. I am prepared to discuss any modifications to current procedures that might support broader divisional objectives or address specific operational concerns.

The current system has operated without incident since implementation in 1970, and I anticipate continued reliable performance under existing procedures. Our disposal area has adequate capacity to support projected production increases through 1973, assuming current waste generation rates remain consistent with historical patterns.
