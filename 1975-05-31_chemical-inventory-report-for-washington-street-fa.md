## WASTE GENERATION AND DISPOSAL

### Hazardous Waste Streams

The facility generates approximately 2,400 gallons per month of hazardous waste consisting primarily of spent solvents, contaminated cleaning materials, and chemical residues. Waste disposal is conducted through the following methods:

**On-Site Treatment:**
- Solvent recovery operations recover approximately 60% of TCE and PCE for reuse
- Distillation unit processes 800 gallons monthly of recoverable solvents
- Recovery efficiency: TCE 65%, PCE 58%

**Off-Site Disposal:**
- Non-recoverable hazardous waste transported to Chemical Control Corporation, Elizabeth, New Jersey
- Transportation conducted by licensed hauler: Safety-Kleen Corporation
- Disposal frequency: Monthly shipments averaging 960 gallons

**On-Site Disposal:**
- Non-hazardous industrial waste disposed through approved on-site methods
- Liquid waste discharge to process drains connected to facility drainage system
- Solid waste disposal in designated on-site areas

## ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

The facility conducts quarterly groundwater monitoring through four monitoring wells installed in 1973. Monitoring parameters include volatile organic compounds, pH, and conductivity. Results for the first quarter of 1975 indicate:

- Well MW-1 (upgradient): TCE <0.1 mg/L, PCE <0.1 mg/L
- Well MW-2 (downgradient): TCE 2.3 mg/L, PCE 0.8 mg/L
- Well MW-3 (downgradient): TCE 1.7 mg/L, PCE 0.6 mg/L
- Well MW-4 (downgradient): TCE 3.1 mg/L, PCE 1.2 mg/L

Elevated concentrations in downgradient wells are attributed to historical operations and are being addressed through ongoing remediation efforts.

## SPILL PREVENTION AND CONTAINMENT

The facility maintains spill prevention measures including:

- Secondary containment for above-ground storage tanks (110% of tank capacity)
- Spill response equipment including absorbent materials and containment booms
- Employee training program for spill response procedures
- Emergency notification procedures for regulatory agencies

During the reporting period, three minor spill incidents occurred:

1. January 15, 1975: 25-gallon TCE spill during tank transfer operations, contained and recovered
2. March 8, 1975: 12-gallon toluene spill from damaged drum, absorbed and disposed
3. April 22, 1975: 8-gallon MEK spill during loading operations, contained within secondary containment

All incidents were managed in accordance with facility procedures and reported to appropriate authorities as required.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

W.R. Grace Company maintains compliance with applicable federal and state environmental regulations including:

- Clean Air Act requirements for volatile organic compound emissions
- Massachusetts Water Pollution Control regulations for industrial discharges
