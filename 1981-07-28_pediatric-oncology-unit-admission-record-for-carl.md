**CHIEF COMPLAINT:**
Patient presents with persistent fatigue, recurrent fever, and easy bruising over the past six weeks. Mother reports significant weight loss and decreased appetite.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**
Carl is a previously healthy 12-year-old male who began experiencing fatigue and malaise in early June 1981. His mother, Mrs. Donna Robbins, reports that Carl has been increasingly lethargic, complaining of tiredness even after full nights of sleep. Over the past month, she has observed multiple episodes of unexplained bruising on his arms and legs, particularly after minor activities such as bicycle riding or playing baseball with neighborhood children.

The patient has experienced intermittent low-grade fevers ranging from 99.8°F to 101.2°F, typically occurring in the evening hours. Mrs. Robbins notes that Carl's appetite has decreased significantly, with the child refusing many of his previously favorite meals. She estimates a weight loss of approximately 8-10 pounds over the past six weeks.

Of particular concern to the family is Carl's recent complaint of bone pain, specifically in his legs and lower back, which has been interfering with his sleep patterns. The pain appears to worsen during periods of physical activity and has caused Carl to withdraw from summer recreational activities he typically enjoys.

**LABORATORY RESULTS (Drawn 28 July 1981, 14:30 hours):**
- **Complete Blood Count:**
  - White Blood Cell Count: 2,800/μL (Normal: 4,500-11,000)
  - Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL (Normal: 11.5-14.5)
  - Hematocrit: 21.8% (Normal: 34-42%)
  - Platelet Count: 45,000/μL (Normal: 150,000-400,000)
  - Differential: 78% lymphoblasts, 15% mature lymphocytes, 7% neutrophils

- **Basic Metabolic Panel:**
  - Sodium: 138 mEq/L
  - Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
  - Chloride: 102 mEq/L
  - BUN: 18 mg/dL
  - Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
  - Glucose: 95 mg/dL

- **Liver Function Tests:**
  - ALT: 28 U/L
  - AST: 32 U/L
  - Total Bilirubin: 1.4 mg/dL
  - Direct Bilirubin: 0.3 mg/dL

**DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:**
Based on the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the patient presents with findings highly suggestive of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The combination of pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and the presence of 78% lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood count supports this preliminary diagnosis.

**PLAN:**
1. **Immediate Management:**
   - Admit to Pediatric Oncology Unit for further evaluation and treatment
   - Obtain bone marrow aspiration and biopsy scheduled for July 29, 1981
   - Type and crossmatch for potential blood product transfusion
   - Institute neutropenic precautions

2. **Diagnostic Studies:**
   - Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with cytogenetic analysis
   - Lumbar puncture to evaluate for central nervous system involvement
   - Chest X-ray to assess for mediastinal mass
   - Comprehensive metabolic panel including uric acid and LDH

3. **Supportive Care:**
   - Monitor vital signs every 4 hours
   - Daily weights
   - Strict intake and output monitoring
   - Platelet transfusion if count falls below 20,000/μL or if active bleeding
   - Packed red blood cell transfusion if hemoglobin falls below 7.0 g/dL

4. **Family Communication:**
   - Detailed discussion with parents regarding preliminary findings and planned diagnostic procedures
   - Social work consultation for family support services
   - Arrange meeting with pediatric oncology team for treatment planning once diagnosis is confirmed

**PROGNOSIS:**
Pending confirmation of diagnosis through bone marrow examination. If acute lymphoblastic leukemia is confirmed, the prognosis will depend on various factors including age, white blood cell count at presentation, and cytogenetic findings. Current protocols suggest favorable outcomes are possible with appropriate treatment.
