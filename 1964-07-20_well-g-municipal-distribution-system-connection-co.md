# TECHNICAL REPORT
**CITY OF WOBURN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS**

## WELL G MUNICIPAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM CONNECTION COMPLETION REPORT

**TO:** Francis P. O'Brien, Director, Department of Public Works  
**FROM:** Robert J. McKenna, City Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** July 20, 1964  
**RE:** Final System Integration and Operational Status - Well G Water Supply

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents the successful completion of Well G integration into the City of Woburn municipal water distribution system. The new water source, located in the eastern section of the city near the Aberjona River, has been fully connected to the distribution network and is now operational as a supplemental supply serving approximately 8,500 residents in the East Woburn area. All system tests have been completed and the well is approved for immediate service to meet growing municipal water demands.

## PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

The Well G project was initiated in response to increasing water demand from Woburn's growing population of 35,000 residents. Located twelve miles north of Boston, our community has experienced steady residential and commercial growth requiring expansion of municipal water supply capacity. Well G represents a critical addition to our water infrastructure, designed to supplement existing supplies during peak demand periods and provide redundancy for system reliability.

The well site was selected following extensive geological surveys conducted by Whitman & Howard Engineering in 1963, which identified a productive aquifer in the eastern section of the city. The location, situated within the Aberjona River watershed, was determined to offer optimal yield characteristics and strategic positioning for distribution to East Woburn neighborhoods.

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND INSTALLATION

**Well Construction Details:**
- Total depth: 88 feet
- Casing diameter: 12 inches (steel)
- Screen interval: 68-88 feet
- Pump capacity: 400 gallons per minute
- Static water level: 22 feet below grade
- Drawdown at capacity: 18 feet

**Distribution System Integration:**
- Main transmission line: 12-inch cast iron, 2,100 feet to existing distribution network
- Connection point: Main Street (Route 38) distribution main
- Booster station: Not required due to adequate natural pressure
- Control systems: Manual valve operation with remote monitoring capability

The well penetrates a confined aquifer within the bedrock trench underlying eastern Woburn. Geological analysis indicates the aquifer consists primarily of stratified sand and gravel deposits with excellent permeability characteristics. The water-bearing formation extends throughout the East Woburn area and connects to the broader Aberjona River groundwater system.

## WATER QUALITY TESTING AND ANALYSIS

Comprehensive water quality testing was conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Laboratory in Boston during June 1964. All samples were collected following standard protocols and analyzed for bacterial contamination, chemical composition, and physical characteristics.

**Bacteriological Results:**
- Coliform bacteria: Negative (3 samples tested)
- Total bacterial count: Within acceptable limits
- Certification: Approved for potable use

**Chemical Analysis:**
- pH: 6.8 (within normal range)
- Total dissolved solids: 180 mg/L
- Hardness: 85 mg/L (moderately soft)
- Iron content: 0.3 mg/L
- Chloride content: 12 mg/L
- Fluoride content: 0.1 mg/L

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Turbidity: Clear
- Color: Colorless
- Odor: None detected
- Taste: Normal

All test results meet or exceed state and federal standards for municipal water supply. The water quality is consistent with other wells in the Woburn system and requires no treatment prior to distribution.

## DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND SERVICE AREA

Well G has been integrated to serve the East Woburn service area, encompassing residential neighborhoods east of Main Street (Route 38). The primary service area includes:

- Pine Street residential district
- Salem Street neighborhood
- Maple Street corridor
- East Woburn industrial area
- Portions of the Acres neighborhood

Approximately 2,800 households and 150 commercial/industrial properties are within the Well G service zone. The well is designed as a supplemental source, operating in conjunction with existing Wells A, B, C, D, E, and F to maintain adequate pressure and flow throughout the distribution system.

**System Hydraulics:**
- Operating pressure: 65-85 PSI
- Peak demand capacity: 400 GPM
- Average daily demand (projected): 280 GPM
- Emergency backup capability: Full integration with existing well network

## OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES AND MONITORING

Well G operations will be managed through the central water department facility at 100 Pleasant Street. Standard operating procedures have been established for:

**Daily Operations:**
- Morning system pressure checks
- Flow rate monitoring and recording
- Visual inspection of wellhead and immediate area
- Pump performance assessment

**Weekly Monitoring:**
- Water level measurements
- Pump efficiency calculations
- Distribution system pressure mapping
- Customer service area inspection

**Monthly Testing:**
- Bacteriological sampling (as required by state regulations)
- Chemical analysis (quarterly basis)
- Equipment maintenance and calibration
- System performance reporting

All operational data will be maintained in department records and reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health as required by state regulations governing municipal water supplies.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND APPROVALS

Well G construction and operation has received all required regulatory approvals:

- **Massachusetts Department of Public Health:** Water supply permit approved June 15, 1964
- **Massachusetts Department of Natural Resources:** Groundwater withdrawal permit approved May 28, 1964
- **City of Woburn Board of Health:** Local approval granted July 10, 1964
- **Department of Public Works:** Construction completion certified July 18, 1964

All construction work was performed in accordance with state plumbing codes and municipal specifications. Final inspection was completed by state health officials on July 17, 1964, with approval granted for immediate operational status.

## COST ANALYSIS AND PROJECT BUDGET

**Total Project Cost:** $127,500

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Well drilling and casing: $18,500
- Pump and motor installation: $12,800
- Distribution line construction: $38,200
- Electrical and control systems: $15,600
- Site preparation and restoration: $8,900
- Engineering and inspection: $14,200
- Permits and regulatory fees: $2,800
- Contingency and miscellaneous: $16,500

The project was completed within approved budget parameters and represents excellent value for the expansion of municipal water supply capacity. Cost per gallon of daily capacity compares favorably with similar projects in comparable Massachusetts communities.

## CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Well G represents a successful addition to the Woburn municipal water system, providing essential capacity to meet growing community needs. The well's location in the productive East Woburn aquifer ensures reliable long-term supply, while integration with existing distribution infrastructure maximizes operational efficiency.

**Key Achievements:**
- Successful completion within budget and schedule
- Full regulatory compliance and approvals
- Excellent water quality meeting all standards
- Seamless integration with existing system
- Enhanced service reliability for East Woburn residents

**Operational Recommendations:**

1. **Routine Monitoring:** Maintain regular testing schedule to ensure continued water quality and system performance
2. **Preventive Maintenance:** Implement comprehensive pump and equipment maintenance program
3. **System Optimization:** Monitor demand patterns to optimize well operation and minimize energy costs
4. **Future Planning:** Consider Well G experience in planning additional system expansions

**Long-term Considerations:**

The Department should continue monitoring groundwater levels and quality throughout the East Woburn aquifer system. While current conditions are excellent, ongoing vigilance is essential to protect this valuable water resource for future generations. Regular coordination with state health officials will ensure continued compliance with evolving water quality standards.

Well G is now fully operational and ready to serve the water supply needs of East Woburn residents. The Department of Public Works has fulfilled its responsibility to provide safe, reliable municipal water service through this important infrastructure investment.
