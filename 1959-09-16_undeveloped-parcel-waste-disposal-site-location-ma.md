# JOHN J. RILEY COMPANY
## SITE SURVEY AND MAPPING DIVISION
### 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts

**TECHNICAL SURVEY REPORT**

**TO:** Facility Foreman - Tannery Operations  
**FROM:** Site Surveyor - Riley Company Survey Division  
**DATE:** September 16, 1959  
**RE:** Undeveloped Parcel Waste Disposal Site Location Map

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This technical survey report documents the location and characteristics of designated waste disposal areas within the undeveloped parcels adjacent to the John J. Riley Company tannery facility. Survey conducted September 14-16, 1959, utilizing standard theodolite measurements and chain survey methods. All coordinates referenced to Massachusetts State Grid System, Zone 2.

## SITE DESCRIPTION AND BOUNDARIES

**Primary Survey Area:** Undeveloped parcels located southwest of main tannery building complex  
**Total Surveyed Area:** Approximately 47.3 acres  
**Elevation Range:** 102 feet to 118 feet above mean sea level  
**Soil Composition:** Predominantly sandy loam with clay substrate at 8-12 feet depth  

### Boundary Markers

- **Northern Boundary:** Chain link fence line, 1,247 feet linear measurement
- **Eastern Boundary:** Property line adjacent to Salem Street right-of-way
- **Southern Boundary:** Natural drainage swale extending 892 feet east-west
- **Western Boundary:** Boston & Maine Railroad tracks and associated right-of-way

## WASTE DISPOSAL SITE LOCATIONS

### Site A - Primary Liquid Waste Disposal Area

**Coordinates:** N 42°23'14" W 71°09'32"  
**Dimensions:** 180 feet × 240 feet rectangular excavation  
**Depth:** 12 feet maximum, 8 feet average  
**Current Status:** Active disposal site for tannery process liquids  

**Site Characteristics:**
- Natural clay lining at base provides containment
- Gravity-fed drainage system from main tannery building
- Access road suitable for tank truck operations
- Estimated capacity: 2,400 cubic yards liquid waste

**Disposal Materials Observed:**
- Chrome-based tanning solutions (spent)
- Vegetable tanning extracts and residues
- Process wash water containing dissolved organics
- Dehairing and liming solution waste

### Site B - Solid Waste and Sludge Disposal Area

**Coordinates:** N 42°23'08" W 71°09'28"  
**Dimensions:** 320 feet × 150 feet irregular polygon  
**Depth:** Variable, 6-15 feet  
**Current Status:** Active disposal for solid manufacturing waste  

**Site Characteristics:**
- Natural depression enhanced by excavation
- Compacted earth access for truck dumping
- Drainage toward southeastern corner
- Estimated total capacity: 4,200 cubic yards solid waste

**Disposal Materials Catalogued:**
- Hair and flesh waste from hide processing
- Spent tan bark and vegetable matter
- Filter cake from settling pond operations
- Lime sludge from dehairing operations
- Miscellaneous leather scraps and trimmings

### Site C - Overflow and Emergency Disposal Area

**Coordinates:** N 42°23'11" W 71°09'25"  
**Dimensions:** 200 feet × 100 feet rectangular area  
**Depth:** 4 feet average  
**Current Status:** Reserve capacity for peak disposal periods  

**Site Characteristics:**
- Prepared earth surface with gravel base
- Temporary storage capability
- Direct access from main facility
- Designed for periodic cleanup and material transfer

## HYDROGEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS

### Surface Water Features

**Drainage Pattern:** Natural surface water flow direction southeast toward Aberjona River  
**Seasonal Water Table:** Observed at 6-8 feet below surface during September survey  
**Soil Permeability:** Moderate to high in upper sandy layers, low in clay substrate  

### Groundwater Considerations

Survey indicates groundwater movement generally eastward toward Aberjona River corridor. Clay layer at 8-12 feet depth provides natural barrier between disposal sites and deeper aquifer systems. Seasonal fluctuations in water table level noted, with spring high water approximately 2-3 feet higher than current September measurements.

**Monitoring Wells:** None currently installed on surveyed parcels  
**Distance to Nearest Water Supply:** Private wells located approximately 1,200 feet northeast  
**Bedrock Depth:** Not encountered within survey scope (estimated 25-40 feet)  

## SITE ACCESS AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Transportation Infrastructure

**Primary Access:** Gravel road from Salem Street gate, 16-foot width  
**Secondary Access:** Railroad siding connection for tank car operations  
**Load Capacity:** Road surface suitable for trucks up to 20-ton gross weight  
**Seasonal Limitations:** Spring thaw period may require access restrictions  

### Operational Efficiency Factors

Current disposal site configuration allows for:
- Continuous liquid waste disposal operations
- Segregated solid waste management
- Emergency overflow capacity during peak production
- Minimal transportation costs from main facility
- Natural containment features reduce operational requirements

## ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE STATUS

Operations conducted in accordance with:
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines for industrial waste
- Local municipal ordinances regarding waste disposal
- Standard industry practices for tannery waste management
- Company environmental policies as established 1954

**Permit Status:** Current disposal operations authorized under Massachusetts Industrial Waste Disposal Permit #IW-1247, issued June 1957, valid through June 1962.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONTINUED OPERATIONS

### Short-term Operational Improvements (1959-1960)

1. **Enhanced Site Monitoring:** Install groundwater monitoring wells at three locations to track subsurface conditions
2. **Access Road Maintenance:** Grade and resurface primary access road before winter season
3. **Drainage Management:** Construct surface water diversion channels to direct rainfall away from disposal areas
4. **Waste Segregation:** Implement improved separation procedures for different waste stream categories

### Long-term Site Development (1960-1965)

1. **Capacity Expansion:** Site B suitable for eastward expansion pending acquisition of adjacent 3.2-acre parcel
2. **Containment Enhancement:** Consider installation of engineered clay liner system for liquid disposal areas
3. **Transportation Infrastructure:** Evaluate rail siding extension for increased tank car access
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Monitor evolving state regulations regarding industrial waste disposal requirements

## SURVEYOR CERTIFICATION

This survey conducted using standard engineering survey methods and equipment. All measurements verified through duplicate readings and cross-referencing to established benchmarks. Site conditions documented through photographic record (contact prints available upon request).

Weather conditions during survey: Clear skies, temperatures 58-72°F, minimal wind. Ground conditions dry with normal seasonal characteristics for September in Massachusetts.

**Survey Accuracy:** ±2 feet horizontal positioning, ±6 inches elevation measurements  
**Survey Date:** September 14-16, 1959  
**Survey Crew:** Two-person team with theodolite and chain measurements
