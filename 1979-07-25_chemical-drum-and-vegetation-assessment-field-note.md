# Chemical Drum and Vegetation Assessment Field Notes

**Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection**  
**Division of Water Pollution Control**  
**Field Investigation Report**

**Inspector:** Robert M. Sullivan, Environmental Engineer  
**Date:** July 25, 1979  
**Time:** 0900-1630 hours  
**Weather:** Clear, 78°F, light wind from SW  
**Investigation Site:** Industrial properties adjacent to Wells G and H, East Woburn  

## Executive Summary

This field assessment documents observations of chemical waste storage and disposal practices at industrial facilities within the Aberjona River Valley watershed, conducted in response to volatile organic compound contamination detected in municipal Wells G and H during May 1979 testing. Physical evidence of improper waste handling and environmental degradation was observed at multiple locations.

## Site 1: W.R. Grace/Cryovac Facility - 369 Washington Street

**Coordinates:** Approximately 1,200 feet northeast of Well G  
**Property Description:** 15-acre industrial complex with manufacturing buildings, storage areas, and undeveloped land

### Chemical Storage and Disposal Areas

**Primary Observation Area - Southwest Corner of Property:**
- Located approximately 47 metal drums of varying sizes (30-55 gallon capacity)
- Drum conditions: 23 drums showing visible rust and corrosion, 8 drums with apparent leak stains beneath
- Strong chemical odor consistent with chlorinated solvents noted within 50-foot radius
- Soil discoloration observed in 12 x 18 foot area surrounding drum cluster
- No containment barriers or secondary containment systems observed

**Waste Pit Area - Western Property Boundary:**
- Excavated depression approximately 20 x 30 feet, depth estimated 4-6 feet
- Evidence of liquid waste disposal: dark staining, chemical odors
- Surrounding vegetation showing signs of chemical stress (browning, stunted growth)
- No liner or containment measures visible

**Surface Water Drainage:**
- Natural drainage pattern flows southwest toward Aberjona River tributary
- Visible surface staining along drainage pathway
- Chemical sheen observed on standing water in low-lying areas

### Vegetation Assessment

**Affected Area Mapping:**
- Dead and dying vegetation documented in 2.3-acre area downslope from waste storage
- Tree mortality: 18 mature oak and maple trees showing crown dieback
- Ground cover: Extensive areas of bare soil where grass and shrubs have died
- Surviving vegetation shows chlorosis and stunted growth patterns

**Photographic Documentation:**
- Roll 1, Frames 1-12: Drum storage area and soil staining
- Roll 1, Frames 13-24: Vegetation damage and surface water impacts
- Roll 2, Frames 1-8: Waste pit and drainage patterns

## Site 2: Beatrice Foods/Riley Tannery Property - 228 Salem Street

**Coordinates:** Approximately 1,800 feet southwest of Well H  
**Property Description:** Former tannery operations with associated waste lagoons and disposal areas

### Waste Lagoon System

**Lagoon Complex - Eastern Section:**
- Three connected settling ponds, total area approximately 1.5 acres
- Liquid levels varying from 2-5 feet depth
- Surface colors ranging from dark brown to reddish-orange
- Strong organic and chemical odors
- No visible liner system or leak detection

**Chemical Drum Storage - North Building:**
- Approximately 35 drums stored in partially covered area
- Multiple drums showing corrosion and leak evidence
- Liquid pooling observed beneath storage area
- Chemical odors consistent with organic solvents and tanning chemicals

### Soil and Groundwater Indicators

**Visual Assessment:**
- Soil discoloration extending 200+ feet from lagoon system
- Surface seepage areas with chemical odors
- Dead vegetation in concentric pattern around waste areas
- Standing water with chemical films and unusual coloration

**Drainage Patterns:**
- Natural flow toward Aberjona River system
- Evidence of seasonal flooding that could mobilize contaminants
- No apparent containment of surface runoff

## Site 3: Adjacent Properties and Downgradient Areas

### Residential Property Impacts - Forest Street Area

**Well Water Observations:**
- Visited 6 residential properties with private wells
- 3 homeowners reported recent changes in water taste/odor
- 2 properties showing dead/dying lawn areas near well heads
- Chemical odors noted at 4 residential well locations

### Surface Water Assessment - Aberjona River Tributary

**Water Quality Indicators:**
- Visible chemical sheen on water surface at multiple locations
- Unusual water coloration (reddish-brown tint)
- Dead fish observed in tributary near industrial discharge points
- Aquatic vegetation showing stress patterns

## Laboratory Sample Collection

**Soil Samples Collected:**
- Sample S-1: Grace property, drum storage area
- Sample S-2: Grace property, waste pit location
- Sample S-3: Riley property, lagoon perimeter
- Sample S-4: Background sample, upgradient location

**Water Samples Collected:**
- Sample W-1: Standing water, Grace waste pit
- Sample W-2: Lagoon liquid, Riley property
- Sample W-3: Surface water, Aberjona tributary
- Sample W-4: Residential well, Forest Street

**Chain of Custody:** All samples transferred to DEP Laboratory, Boston, for volatile organic compound analysis per Standard Methods 502.1 and 502.2

## Meteorological and Hydrogeological Factors

**Groundwater Flow Direction:**
- Regional flow appears to be southwest toward Aberjona River
- Seasonal water table fluctuations could enhance contaminant mobility
- Permeable glacial outwash deposits provide minimal natural attenuation

**Precipitation Patterns:**
- Above-normal rainfall in June 1979 (4.2 inches above average)
- Recent heavy precipitation events likely enhanced contaminant leaching
- Surface runoff patterns direct flow toward municipal well field area

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Immediate Environmental Concerns

1. **Groundwater Contamination Risk:** Direct evidence of chemical releases in hydraulically connected area to municipal wells
2. **Surface Water Impacts:** Visible contamination of tributary system feeding Aberjona River
3. **Vapor Emissions:** Chemical odors indicating ongoing volatile compound releases
4. **Ecological Damage:** Widespread vegetation mortality indicating toxic exposure levels

### Recommended Actions

**Emergency Response:**
- Immediate containment of leaking drums and waste materials
- Installation of monitoring wells between industrial sources and municipal wells
- Expanded water quality testing for affected residential wells
- Health advisory for residents using private wells in affected area

**Long-term Monitoring:**
- Quarterly groundwater monitoring program
- Surface water quality assessment
- Soil contamination delineation study
- Ecological impact assessment

**Regulatory Follow-up:**
- Enforcement action against facilities for improper waste disposal
- Required remediation plans and schedules
- Enhanced permit conditions for industrial discharge
- Coordination with Department of Public Health on exposure assessment
