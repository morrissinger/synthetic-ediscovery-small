# JOHN J. RILEY COMPANY

### 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts

**TO:** All Tannery Operations Staff  
**FROM:** Facility Foreman  
**DATE:** September 15, 1959  
**RE:** Revised Waste Solution Disposal Instructions for Remote Parcel Areas

---

## IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED

Effective immediately, all tannery operations staff must follow these updated procedures for the disposal of waste solutions in the remote parcel areas adjacent to our main facility. These instructions supersede all previous disposal guidelines and must be strictly adhered to by all personnel involved in waste handling operations.

### BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Recent expansion of our leather processing operations has resulted in increased volumes of waste solutions requiring disposal. The main facility drainage systems have reached capacity limitations, necessitating the utilization of remote disposal areas on company property. These procedures have been developed to ensure efficient waste management while maintaining operational continuity and minimizing disruption to our production schedules.

### DESIGNATED DISPOSAL AREAS

**Primary Remote Disposal Zone:** The fifteen-acre parcel located approximately 800 feet southwest of the main tannery building, bounded by the abandoned railroad spur to the west and the natural drainage channel to the east. This area has been surveyed and designated as suitable for liquid waste disposal operations.

**Secondary Disposal Zone:** The eight-acre section north of the primary zone, extending to the property line adjacent to the undeveloped wetland areas. This zone shall be utilized when the primary area requires maintenance or during periods of high-volume disposal operations.

### WASTE SOLUTION CATEGORIES

**Category A - Chromium Solutions:** All spent chromium sulfate solutions, chrome liquors, and related tanning bath residues. These solutions typically exhibit a greenish coloration and pH levels below 3.5.

**Category B - Degreasing Solvents:** Industrial solvents used in hide degreasing operations, including but not limited to trichloroethylene-based solutions, perchloroethylene compounds, and mixed solvent systems. These solutions are characterized by their volatile nature and distinctive chemical odor.

**Category C - General Process Waters:** Rinse waters, wash solutions, and other aqueous waste streams generated during routine leather processing operations. These solutions may contain varying concentrations of dissolved organics, suspended solids, and residual chemical additives.

### DISPOSAL PROCEDURES

#### Transport Operations
All waste solutions must be transported to designated disposal areas using the company's tank truck (License Plate MA-4472) or the smaller wheeled tank units for volumes under 200 gallons. Transport operations shall be conducted during daylight hours when possible, with all containers properly secured to prevent spillage during transit.

#### Application Methods
**Direct Discharge Method:** For liquid waste solutions, discharge directly onto the designated disposal areas using the gravity-fed hose system. Ensure even distribution across the available area to prevent localized pooling. The natural soil composition in these areas provides adequate absorption capacity for routine disposal volumes.

**Concentrated Solution Dilution:** High-concentration waste solutions may be diluted with process water at a ratio of 1:3 prior to discharge. This practice helps ensure proper soil infiltration and reduces the likelihood of surface accumulation during periods of heavy disposal activity.

#### Documentation Requirements
Maintain disposal logs recording the date, time, volume, and waste category for each disposal operation. Log entries must be completed immediately following each disposal activity and submitted to the facility foreman on a weekly basis. Include any observations regarding unusual odors, soil conditions, or equipment malfunctions.

### OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

#### Weather Conditions
Disposal operations may continue during light precipitation, as natural moisture assists in soil infiltration. However, suspend all disposal activities during periods of heavy rainfall or when standing water is present in the disposal areas. Resume operations only after surface conditions return to normal.

#### Equipment Maintenance
Inspect all transport and discharge equipment weekly for signs of corrosion, leakage, or mechanical wear. Report any equipment deficiencies to the maintenance supervisor immediately. Replacement parts and repair services are available through our regular industrial suppliers.

#### Personnel Safety
While these disposal operations involve routine industrial chemicals, personnel should exercise normal industrial safety precautions. Avoid prolonged direct contact with waste solutions and ensure adequate ventilation when working in enclosed areas. Safety equipment including rubber gloves and protective eyewear is available from the facility supply room.

### SITE MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE

#### Periodic Inspections
Conduct monthly visual inspections of all disposal areas to assess soil conditions and identify any areas requiring attention. Document any changes in vegetation, soil coloration, or surface conditions in the facility maintenance log.

#### Area Rotation
To prevent over-saturation of any single disposal area, rotate disposal activities between the primary and secondary zones on a quarterly basis. This practice helps maintain the long-term viability of our disposal operations and ensures optimal use of available property.

#### Boundary Maintenance
Maintain clear boundaries between disposal areas and adjacent property lines. Ensure that all disposal activities occur within designated company property boundaries and do not encroach upon neighboring parcels or public areas.

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

These disposal procedures have been developed in accordance with current Massachusetts industrial waste management practices and local municipal requirements. The company maintains appropriate permits and licenses for all waste disposal activities conducted on company property.

### REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Any incidents involving equipment malfunction, unusual waste characteristics, or operational difficulties must be reported immediately to the facility foreman. Additionally, any inquiries from municipal officials, neighboring property owners, or other external parties regarding waste disposal operations should be directed to the company office for appropriate response.

### IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE

All personnel involved in waste handling operations must review these instructions thoroughly and acknowledge receipt by signing the attached acknowledgment form. Training sessions will be conducted for any personnel requiring clarification of these procedures.

Questions regarding these instructions should be directed to the facility foreman during regular business hours. These procedures will remain in effect until further notice and may be modified as operational requirements dictate.
