# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** City Manager  
**FROM:** Woburn Water Department  
**DATE:** July 19, 1976  
**RE:** Weekly Water Production Summary for Wells G and H - July 12-18, 1976

This memo provides the weekly production summary for municipal Wells G and H for the period ending July 18, 1976, in accordance with our standard reporting procedures established following the wells' incorporation into the city water distribution system.

**Production Summary:**

Well G (commissioned 1964) operated at 85% capacity during the reporting period, producing approximately 1.2 million gallons of water. The well maintained consistent flow rates throughout the week, with no mechanical issues reported by field personnel. Routine chlorination procedures were followed according to state health department guidelines, with chlorine residual levels maintained between 0.2 and 0.4 parts per million at the wellhead.

Well H (commissioned 1966) operated at 78% capacity, producing approximately 980,000 gallons. A minor pump adjustment was required on July 15th to address pressure fluctuations, but operations returned to normal parameters within two hours. Both wells continue to supplement our primary Pine Street facility, providing essential water supply to meet growing demand in the eastern sections of the city, particularly the residential areas along Montvale Road, Salem Street, and Washington Street.

**Operational Notes:**

Field crews report that both wells are meeting current demand projections, and water quality testing conducted on July 16th showed results within acceptable parameters for municipal distribution. The wells' strategic location allows us to maintain adequate pressure throughout the eastern distribution network while reducing strain on our older infrastructure. We anticipate continued reliance on Wells G and H throughout the remainder of the summer months as residential water usage typically increases during this period.

We will continue weekly monitoring and reporting as requested. Please contact the Water Department office at 933-0771 if you require additional details regarding these operations.
