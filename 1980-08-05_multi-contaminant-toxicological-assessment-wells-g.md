## Executive Summary

This comprehensive toxicological assessment evaluates the multi-contaminant profile identified in East Woburn municipal Wells G and H following their closure in May 1979. Laboratory analysis confirms the presence of multiple volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at concentrations significantly exceeding established safety thresholds. The contamination pattern suggests prolonged industrial discharge from multiple sources within the Aberjona River Valley watershed.

Primary contaminants detected include trichloroethylene (TCE) at 267 parts per billion, tetrachloroethylene (PCE) at 21 ppb, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane at 85 ppb. These concentrations represent exposure levels 13-27 times higher than recommended maximum contaminant levels for drinking water supplies.

## Introduction and Background

Wells G and H commenced operations in 1964 and 1966 respectively, serving as supplemental water sources for eastern Woburn residential areas. During their fifteen-year operational period, these wells provided approximately 2.3 million gallons per day to local distribution systems, serving an estimated 5,000 residents including approximately 1,200 children under age 15.

The wells draw from an unconfined glacial aquifer within the Aberjona River Valley, a geological formation characterized by highly permeable sand and gravel deposits. This hydrogeological setting facilitates rapid contaminant migration from surface and subsurface sources to groundwater supplies.

Industrial activities within the wellhead protection zone include the W.R. Grace Company Cryovac facility at 369 Washington Street and the John J. Riley Company tannery operations at 228 Salem Street, both representing potential point sources for organic solvent contamination.

## Methodology

### Sample Collection Protocol

Water samples were collected from Wells G and H using EPA Method 624 protocols for volatile organic analysis. Samples were obtained directly from wellhead discharge points using glass containers with Teflon-lined caps to prevent sample degradation. Chain of custody procedures were maintained throughout collection and transport to EPA laboratory facilities in Boston.

### Analytical Methods

Volatile organic compound analysis was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) following EPA Method 624. Detection limits for target compounds ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 parts per billion. Quality control measures included duplicate analysis, blank samples, and certified reference standards.

### Toxicological Assessment Framework

Health risk evaluation utilized EPA guidelines for carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects. Exposure scenarios considered residential consumption patterns, including direct ingestion, dermal absorption during bathing, and inhalation of volatilized compounds during household water use.

## Results and Findings

### Contaminant Profile - Well G

| Compound | Concentration (ppb) | EPA MCL (ppb) | Exceedance Factor |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Trichloroethylene | 267 | 5 | 53.4x |
| Tetrachloroethylene | 21 | 5 | 4.2x |
| 1,1,1-Trichloroethane | 85 | 200 | Below MCL |
| Chloroform | 12 | 100 | Below MCL |
| Carbon Tetrachloride | 8.5 | 5 | 1.7x |

### Contaminant Profile - Well H

| Compound | Concentration (ppb) | EPA MCL (ppb) | Exceedance Factor |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Trichloroethylene | 183 | 5 | 36.6x |
| Tetrachloroethylene | 15 | 5 | 3.0x |
| 1,1,1-Trichloroethane | 62 | 200 | Below MCL |
| Chloroform | 8.2 | 100 | Below MCL |
| Carbon Tetrachloride | 4.8 | 5 | Below MCL |

### Temporal Contamination Analysis

Historical records indicate Wells G and H exhibited detectable organic contamination as early as 1976, based on limited screening conducted by Massachusetts Department of Public Health. However, comprehensive volatile organic analysis was not performed until May 1979 following citizen complaints regarding water taste and odor.

Groundwater modeling suggests contaminant plumes originated from industrial disposal practices occurring between 1965-1975, with peak concentrations reaching the wellfield during the mid-1970s period. The time lag between initial contamination and detection represents a critical failure in monitoring protocols.

## Health Risk Assessment

### Carcinogenic Risk Evaluation

Trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are classified as probable human carcinogens (Group B2) under EPA guidelines. Lifetime cancer risk calculations indicate excess cancer risk of 2.4 × 10⁻³ for residents consuming Well G water, representing 240 additional cancer cases per 100,000 exposed individuals. This risk level exceeds EPA's acceptable risk range of 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁶ by two orders of magnitude.

### Non-Carcinogenic Health Effects

Chronic exposure to detected contaminant levels may result in:
- Central nervous system depression and neurological dysfunction
- Hepatic toxicity and liver enzyme elevation
- Reproductive and developmental effects
- Immunosuppression and increased infection susceptibility

### Vulnerable Population Analysis

Children represent the population subset at greatest risk due to:
- Higher water consumption per body weight
- Increased absorption rates for volatile compounds
- Developmental sensitivity to neurotoxic effects
- Longer potential exposure duration

Epidemiological surveillance indicates elevated incidence of childhood leukemia in East Woburn neighborhoods served by Wells G and H during the contamination period. While causal relationships require further investigation, the temporal and spatial correlation warrants immediate public health intervention.

## Source Attribution Analysis

### Industrial Discharge Patterns

Contamination signatures suggest multiple source contributions:

**W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Facility:** Trichloroethylene predominance consistent with degreasing operations and packaging machinery manufacturing. Disposal practices included surface impoundments and direct discharge to unlined lagoons northeast of wellfield.

**John J. Riley Company Tannery:** Tetrachloroethylene and related compounds associated with leather processing and finishing operations. Historical records document solvent waste disposal in unlined pits southwest of Wells G and H.

### Hydrogeological Transport Mechanisms

Groundwater flow patterns within the Aberjona Valley aquifer facilitate contaminant migration from both industrial sites toward municipal wellfields. Seasonal variations in groundwater elevation create preferential flow paths that concentrate contamination during high-demand periods.

## Regulatory Compliance Assessment

### Safe Drinking Water Act Violations

Wells G and H operations violated Safe Drinking Water Act provisions through:
- Exceedance of maximum contaminant levels for multiple regulated compounds
- Failure to implement required monitoring protocols
- Inadequate public notification of contamination events

### State Environmental Violations

Massachusetts environmental regulations were violated through:
- Unpermitted discharge of hazardous substances to groundwater
- Failure to report known contamination to state authorities
- Inadequate waste disposal practices at industrial facilities

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Permanent Well Closure:** Wells G and H must remain permanently closed to prevent further public exposure to contaminated groundwater.

2. **Alternative Water Supply:** Municipal authorities must establish permanent alternative water sources for affected neighborhoods, including connection to uncontaminated distribution systems.

3. **Public Health Surveillance:** Comprehensive health screening programs should be implemented for residents exposed to contaminated water supplies, with particular emphasis on pediatric populations.

### Long-term Remediation Strategy

1. **Source Control:** Industrial facilities must implement immediate source control measures to prevent
