# CHEMICAL WASTE HANDLING AND GROUND DISPOSAL SAFETY PROTOCOL

**CRYOVAC INCORPORATED**  
**WOBURN MANUFACTURING FACILITY**  
**15 OLYMPIA AVENUE, WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS 01801**

**Document Classification:** Internal Operations Manual  
**Revision:** 2.1  
**Effective Date:** February 22, 1969  
**Prepared by:** Robert M. Hennessey, Maintenance Supervisor  
**Approved by:** [Signature block - approval pending]

## 1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

This protocol establishes standardized procedures for the handling, storage, and disposal of chemical waste materials generated during manufacturing operations at the Cryovac Incorporated Woburn facility. All maintenance personnel, production supervisors, and facility management staff are required to follow these procedures to ensure compliance with company safety standards and applicable Massachusetts industrial regulations.

The Woburn facility produces polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film and packaging materials through processes that generate various chemical byproducts and waste solvents. Proper handling of these materials is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and protecting company assets.

## 2. SCOPE OF APPLICATION

This protocol applies to all chemical waste materials generated at the Woburn facility, including but not limited to:

- **Trichloroethylene (TCE)** - Primary degreasing solvent
- **Tetrachloroethylene (PCE)** - Secondary cleaning agent  
- **1,1,1-Trichloroethane** - Equipment maintenance solvent
- **Methylene chloride** - Paint stripping and cleaning operations
- **Vinyl chloride residues** - Production waste from PVC manufacturing
- **Contaminated cutting oils** - Machine shop operations
- **Spent acid solutions** - Equipment cleaning and maintenance

## 3. WASTE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

### 3.1 Category A Wastes (High Volume Solvents)
Trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene represent the highest volume waste streams from our degreasing operations. These solvents maintain excellent cleaning properties even when contaminated with oils and metal particles, making recovery and reuse economically advantageous where feasible.

### 3.2 Category B Wastes (Contaminated Solutions)
Mixed solvent solutions containing multiple chemical components that cannot be easily separated for reuse. These typically result from equipment cleaning operations and spill cleanup activities.

### 3.3 Category C Wastes (Solid Contaminated Materials)
Rags, absorbent materials, filters, and solid debris contaminated with chemical solvents. These materials require special handling due to their potential for vapor emission and fire hazard.

## 4. COLLECTION AND TEMPORARY STORAGE

### 4.1 Collection Procedures
All chemical waste must be collected in approved containers clearly marked with contents and collection date. Steel drums (55-gallon capacity) are preferred for liquid wastes, with smaller containers used only for temporary accumulation before transfer to primary storage drums.

Waste collection points are established at:
- **Building A**: East loading dock area (TCE/PCE wastes)
- **Building B**: Maintenance shop rear exit (mixed solvents)  
- **Building C**: Production floor north wall (solid contaminated materials)

### 4.2 Temporary Storage Requirements
Temporary storage areas must be:
- Located away from production areas and employee break rooms
- Equipped with adequate ventilation to prevent vapor accumulation
- Protected from weather exposure and temperature extremes
- Accessible to waste transport vehicles

Maximum temporary storage period is **30 days** from initial collection date.

## 5. GROUND DISPOSAL PROCEDURES

### 5.1 Site Selection and Preparation
Ground disposal operations shall be conducted at designated areas on company property located a minimum of 100 feet from any building structure. The primary disposal area is located in the rear (west) section of the facility property, approximately 200 yards southwest of Building C.

Prior to disposal activities:
1. Inspect disposal area for proper drainage characteristics
2. Ensure adequate soil absorption capacity
3. Verify minimum 50-foot distance from any known water wells or surface water features
4. Post appropriate warning signs during disposal operations

### 5.2 Liquid Waste Disposal Method
Liquid chemical wastes classified as Category A or Category B may be disposed of through controlled ground application using the following procedure:

1. **Site Preparation**: Clear disposal area of vegetation and debris. Create shallow depression approximately 2 feet deep and 6 feet in diameter.

2. **Application Rate**: Limit disposal to maximum 50 gallons per disposal event. Allow minimum 48-hour interval between disposal events at the same location.

3. **Application Technique**: Pour waste slowly to allow soil absorption. Do not exceed soil saturation point. If surface pooling occurs, cease application and allow absorption period of 24 hours minimum.

4. **Post-Disposal**: Cover disposal area with 6 inches of clean soil. Mark location with temporary stakes for tracking purposes.

### 5.3 Solid Waste Disposal
Contaminated solid materials (Category C wastes) shall be disposed of through burial method:

1. Excavate pit minimum 4 feet deep at designated solid waste disposal area
2. Place contaminated materials in pit, ensuring no more than 2 feet depth of waste materials
3. Cover immediately with minimum 2 feet of clean soil
4. Compact soil covering to prevent settling
5. Record disposal location and approximate volume in facility logbook

## 6. SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### 6.1 Personal Protective Equipment
All personnel involved in waste handling and disposal operations must wear:
- Chemical-resistant gloves (neoprene or nitrile)
- Safety glasses with side shields
- Long-sleeved work clothing
- Chemical-resistant footwear

### 6.2 Fire Prevention
Maintain fire extinguisher (Class B foam type) at all waste handling locations. Prohibit smoking within 100 feet of waste handling or disposal areas. Ground all metal containers during transfer operations to prevent static electricity buildup.

### 6.3 Vapor Exposure Limits
Limit individual exposure time to waste handling operations:
- Maximum 2 hours continuous exposure per work shift
- Mandatory 30-minute break period after each hour of waste handling
- Rotate personnel assignments to minimize cumulative exposure

## 7. RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS

### 7.1 Disposal Log Maintenance
Maintain detailed log of all disposal activities including:
- Date and time of disposal
- Type and estimated quantity of waste materials
- Disposal method used (ground application or burial)
- Location coordinates within disposal area
- Personnel responsible for disposal operations
- Weather conditions during disposal

### 7.2 Monthly Reporting
Submit monthly summary report to Plant Manager documenting:
- Total volume of waste materials generated by category
- Disposal methods utilized and frequencies
- Any unusual incidents or equipment malfunctions
- Recommendations for process improvements

## 8. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### 8.1 Spill Response
In event of accidental spill during handling or disposal:
1. Immediately evacuate non-essential personnel from area
2. Identify spill material and approximate volume
3. Contain spill using absorbent materials or soil berming
4. Ventilate area if indoors
5. Clean up spill materials and dispose as contaminated waste
6. Document incident in facility logbook

### 8.2 Personnel Exposure
If employee experiences symptoms of chemical exposure (dizziness, nausea, skin irritation):
1. Remove individual from exposure area immediately
2. Provide fresh air and rest period
3. Flush affected skin areas with clean water
4. Consult plant nurse or arrange medical evaluation if symptoms persist
5. Complete incident report within 24 hours

## 9. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

This protocol has been developed in accordance with:
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health industrial safety guidelines
- Company insurance requirements for chemical handling operations  
- Industry standard practices for solvent waste management
- Federal workplace safety recommendations

Regular review of applicable regulations will be conducted annually, with protocol updates implemented as necessary to maintain compliance with current requirements.
