# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Harold J. Peterson, City Manager  
**FROM:** Robert F. Mitchell, Water Department Operations Manager  
**DATE:** February 12, 1965  
**RE:** Weekly Water Production Status Update - Week Ending February 11, 1965

## Production Summary

This memorandum provides the weekly status update on municipal water production and distribution for the City of Woburn water system serving our 35,000 residents.

**Total Weekly Production:** 18.2 million gallons  
**Average Daily Production:** 2.6 million gallons  
**Peak Day Production:** 2.9 million gallons (February 9th)  

Our primary wells continue to operate within normal parameters. Well A produced 8.4 million gallons, Well B contributed 5.1 million gallons, and our newer facilities are performing as expected. Well G, which opened last year in the eastern section, contributed 4.7 million gallons this week, representing approximately 26% of total production. This supplemental source continues to prove valuable during peak demand periods, particularly serving the residential areas east of Main Street.

## Operational Notes

The recent cold snap has increased residential heating demands, which typically correlates with higher hot water usage. We observed peak consumption on Tuesday evening, likely due to the combination of industrial demand and increased residential usage. The distribution system maintained adequate pressure throughout all service areas, with no reported outages or service interruptions.

Well G's pumping equipment required minor maintenance on February 8th - a routine bearing lubrication that was completed within two hours. The well resumed normal operation immediately afterward. Our maintenance crew noted that the pump housing showed normal wear patterns consistent with approximately 14 months of operation since the well came online.

## Quality Control and Testing

Routine bacteriological samples were collected from all distribution points on February 8th and submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory in Boston. Results are pending but expected within the standard 5-7 day processing period. All previous monthly tests have met state standards for municipal water supplies.

Water temperature readings from Well G averaged 52°F this week, consistent with typical groundwater temperatures for this aquifer. The well continues to draw from the Aberjona River watershed aquifer at the designed depth of 88 feet. Flow rates remain stable at approximately 800 gallons per minute during standard operation cycles.

## Infrastructure and Maintenance

The distribution main replacement project on Olympia Avenue is progressing on schedule. The contractor expects to complete the 400-foot section by February 26th, weather permitting. This upgrade will improve service reliability to approximately 85 residential properties in that area.

We completed annual valve exercises on the eastern distribution network this week, including the connections serving the newer residential developments. All isolation valves operated properly, and we identified only two minor leaks that were immediately repaired. The system integrity remains excellent throughout our service area.

## Budget and Resource Allocation

Current monthly operating expenses are tracking within 3% of budgeted amounts. Chemical costs for water treatment remain stable, with our primary disinfection supplies adequate through the end of March. The recent equipment maintenance on Well G was completed using existing maintenance budget allocations.

Staffing levels remain adequate for current operations. Our three-person operations crew continues to provide 24-hour coverage through rotating shifts, with backup coverage available from the Public Works Department during emergencies.

## Recommendations and Forward Planning

I recommend we proceed with the planned expansion of our testing protocols as discussed in last month's budget review. While our current testing meets all state requirements, additional monitoring would provide enhanced quality assurance for our residents, particularly as we continue to integrate Well G more fully into our regular production schedule.

The eastern distribution network has shown excellent performance since Well G came online. Residents in the East Woburn area report good water pressure and quality. I suggest we consider this successful expansion as a model for future infrastructure development to meet our community's growing water needs.

Weather forecasts indicate continued cold temperatures through February, so we should anticipate sustained higher demand levels. All equipment is functioning properly and ready to meet expected consumption patterns.

Please contact me if you require any additional information regarding water system operations or if you have questions about any aspect of this report.
