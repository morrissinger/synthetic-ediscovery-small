# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Tannery Work Crew  
**FROM:** Plant Supervisor  
**DATE:** July 18, 1932  
**RE:** Authorization for Woodland Waste Disposal Area Expansion

Effective immediately, all crew members are authorized to expand waste disposal operations into the woodland area located approximately 200 yards southwest of the main tannery building. This expansion is necessary due to the increased volume of processing waste generated by our recent contract with the Boston leather goods manufacturers and the summer peak in hide processing operations.

The designated expansion area extends from the existing disposal site to the natural depression near the tree line, encompassing approximately one-half acre of additional land. All liquid waste from the chrome tanning process, including spent tanning solutions, degrasing compounds, and rinse water, may be discharged directly into this expanded area. Solid waste materials, including hair, flesh, and trimmed hide portions, should continue to be buried in the established pits within the original disposal zone. The natural drainage in this area will carry excess liquids toward the Aberjona River, ensuring proper dispersal away from our operational areas.

Crew foreman McCarthy will oversee the initial clearing of underbrush and the excavation of additional waste pits as needed. Standard disposal procedures remain in effect: all chrome-containing solutions are to be discharged during daylight hours when wind conditions favor dispersal away from residential areas to the east. Night disposal operations should be limited to solid waste burial only, as per Mr. Riley's standing instructions regarding neighborhood relations.

This expansion will accommodate our projected waste volumes through the remainder of 1932 and into the following year. The additional capacity should eliminate the need for temporary storage of processing waste in the yard area, which has drawn complaints from workers regarding odors and standing water conditions. All crew members are reminded that disposal operations are to be conducted efficiently and with attention to maintaining the productive capacity of our tanning operations.
