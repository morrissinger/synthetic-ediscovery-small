## CLINICAL HISTORY

This 12-year-old white male from East Woburn, Massachusetts presents with a two-month history of progressive fatigue, pallor, and intermittent fever. Physical examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy. Complete blood count demonstrated severe pancytopenia with circulating blast cells. Bone marrow biopsy was performed to establish definitive diagnosis.

Patient resides at 42 Pine Street, East Woburn, in an area served by municipal Wells G and H. Family history is negative for hematologic malignancies. No known exposure to ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents reported.

## SPECIMEN

Bilateral posterior iliac crest bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy obtained under local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine. Total specimen volume: 3.2 mL aspirate, two core biopsy specimens measuring 1.8 cm and 2.1 cm in length.

## GROSS DESCRIPTION

Bone marrow aspirate appears hypercellular with decreased fat content. Color is deep red-purple, consistent with increased cellular density. Core biopsy specimens show firm, red-brown tissue with intact cortical bone.

## MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION

### Bone Marrow Aspirate
The bone marrow aspirate demonstrates marked hypercellularity (estimated 95%) with predominance of immature lymphoid cells. These blast cells comprise approximately 85% of nucleated cells and exhibit the following morphologic characteristics:

- **Size:** Small to medium (12-18 micrometers)
- **Nuclear morphology:** Round to slightly irregular nuclei with fine, homogeneous chromatin
- **Nucleoli:** 1-2 small, indistinct nucleoli
- **Cytoplasm:** Scant, basophilic cytoplasm without granules
- **Mitotic activity:** Numerous mitotic figures present

Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased:
- **Erythroid precursors:** <5% (normal 20-30%)
- **Myeloid precursors:** <8% (normal 50-60%)
- **Megakaryocytes:** Rare, morphologically normal

### Core Biopsy
The bone marrow core biopsy confirms hypercellularity with complete effacement of normal architecture. Fat spaces are virtually absent. The predominant cell population consists of sheets of monotonous lymphoblasts with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. Reticulin stain demonstrates mild increase in fibrosis (Grade 1/3).

## CYTOCHEMISTRY

- **Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS):** Positive block pattern in blast cells
- **Sudan Black B:** Negative
- **Myeloperoxidase:** Negative
- **Non-specific esterase:** Negative

## IMMUNOPHENOTYPING

Cell surface marker analysis performed on fresh bone marrow aspirate:

- **Common ALL Antigen (CALLA):** Positive (78% of blasts)
- **Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT):** Positive (nuclear staining)
- **B-cell markers (surface immunoglobulin):** Negative
- **T-cell markers (E-rosette formation):** Negative

## CYTOGENETICS

Karyotype analysis pending. Preliminary examination suggests normal diploid chromosome number. Complete cytogenetic report to follow within 5-7 business days.

## DIAGNOSIS

**ACUTE LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, COMMON TYPE (FAB L1)**

The morphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with acute lymphocytic leukemia of the common immunologic subtype. The blast cell morphology corresponds to FAB classification L1, characterized by small, uniform lymphoblasts with homogeneous nuclear chromatin and scant cytoplasm.

## PROGNOSTIC FACTORS

**Favorable factors:**
- Age 12 years (within favorable range of 2-10 years, though at upper limit)
- Common immunologic subtype
- Absence of CNS involvement (lumbar puncture pending)

**Factors requiring monitoring:**
- High initial blast count
- Hepatosplenomegaly at presentation

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate chemotherapy initiation** per Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocol for standard-risk ALL
2. **CNS evaluation** with lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis
3. **Baseline organ function assessment** including cardiac, hepatic, and renal function studies
4. **Infectious disease precautions** given severe neutropenia
5. **Serial monitoring** of peripheral blood counts during induction therapy
6. **Genetic counseling** for family regarding hereditary cancer syndromes (though no clear familial pattern evident)

## ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

This case represents another instance of acute lymphocytic leukemia in a pediatric patient from the East Woburn area. While ALL is the most common childhood leukemia, the clustering of cases in this geographic region may warrant epidemiologic investigation. The patient's residence in an area served by Wells G and H should be noted for any future environmental health studies.

The blast cell morphology and immunophenotype are typical for common-type ALL, and the patient's age places him within a generally favorable prognostic group, though at the upper age limit. With appropriate intensive chemotherapy, the expected complete remission rate exceeds 85% for this subtype.
