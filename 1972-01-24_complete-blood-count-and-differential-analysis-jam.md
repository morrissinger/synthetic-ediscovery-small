## TEST REQUESTED: Complete Blood Count with Differential

### HEMATOLOGY RESULTS

**Complete Blood Count:**

| Parameter | Result | Reference Range | Units | Flag |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|-------|------|
| White Blood Cell Count | 2,100 | 5,000-15,000 | /μL | **L** |
| Red Blood Cell Count | 2.85 | 4.0-5.2 | million/μL | **L** |
| Hemoglobin | 6.8 | 11.5-15.5 | g/dL | **L** |
| Hematocrit | 20.1 | 34-46 | % | **L** |
| Mean Corpuscular Volume | 70.5 | 75-87 | fL | **L** |
| Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin | 23.9 | 25-33 | pg | **L** |
| Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration | 33.8 | 32-36 | g/dL |  |
| Platelet Count | 45,000 | 150,000-450,000 | /μL | **L** |

**Differential Count (Manual):**

| Cell Type | Percentage | Absolute Count | Reference Range (%) | Flag |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|------|
| Neutrophils | 15% | 315/μL | 54-62% | **L** |
| Lymphocytes | 78% | 1,638/μL | 25-33% | **H** |
| Monocytes | 4% | 84/μL | 3-7% |  |
| Eosinophils | 2% | 42/μL | 1-3% |  |
| Basophils | 1% | 21/μL | 0-0.75% | **H** |
| Blasts | 0% | 0/μL | 0% |  |

### PERIPHERAL BLOOD SMEAR EXAMINATION

**Morphology Review:**

**Red Blood Cells:** Marked hypochromia and microcytosis present. Moderate anisocytosis with occasional target cells observed. Polychromasia minimal. No nucleated red blood cells seen.

**White Blood Cells:** Severe leukopenia with relative lymphocytosis. Lymphocytes appear morphologically normal with occasional reactive forms. Neutrophils show normal morphology but are markedly decreased in number. No immature forms or blasts identified in this examination.

**Platelets:** Severe thrombocytopenia. Platelets appear normal in size and morphology. No platelet clumping observed.

**Additional Findings:** No parasites identified. No abnormal cells detected.

### METHODOLOGY

Blood cell counting performed using the Coulter Model S electronic particle counter with manual verification. Differential count performed by manual examination of Wright-stained peripheral blood smear under oil immersion microscopy (1000x magnification). A minimum of 200 white blood cells were counted for differential analysis.

### CLINICAL INTERPRETATION

The laboratory findings demonstrate severe pancytopenia characterized by:

1. **Severe Leukopenia** (WBC 2,100/μL) with absolute neutropenia
2. **Moderate Anemia** (Hemoglobin 6.8 g/dL, Hematocrit 20.1%) with microcytic, hypochromic features
3. **Severe Thrombocytopenia** (Platelet count 45,000/μL)

The constellation of findings suggests significant bone marrow dysfunction. The microcytic, hypochromic anemia may indicate iron deficiency, chronic disease, or primary bone marrow pathology. The absence of circulating blasts in this sample does not exclude hematologic malignancy, as blast cells may not always be present in peripheral circulation during early stages of disease.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate clinical correlation** with patient's presenting symptoms and physical examination findings
2. **Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy** recommended to evaluate for:
   - Acute leukemia
   - Aplastic anemia
   - Myelodysplastic syndrome
   - Other primary bone marrow disorders
3. **Additional laboratory studies** to consider:
   - Reticulocyte count
   - Serum iron studies (iron, TIBC, ferritin)
   - Vitamin B12 and folate levels
   - Direct Coombs test
4. **Infectious disease workup** if clinically indicated
5. **Serial monitoring** of complete blood count

### CRITICAL VALUES NOTIFICATION

**Critical values identified and reported to Dr. Margaret Chen at 16:35 on January 24, 1972:**
- White Blood Cell Count: 2,100/μL (Critical: <3,000/μL)
- Platelet Count: 45,000/μL (Critical: <50,000/μL)
