# INTERNAL MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Plant Safety Committee  
**FROM:** Robert M. Henshaw, Operations Manager  
**DATE:** March 30, 1961  
**RE:** Chemical Inventory and Storage Procedures - Quarterly Review

## Current Chemical Storage Assessment

Following our quarterly safety inspection conducted on March 28, 1961, I am writing to document our current chemical inventory management practices and recommend immediate procedural improvements for our East Woburn facility. As we continue to expand our plastic packaging operations to meet increasing demand from food processing companies, it has become evident that our chemical storage and handling procedures require systematic review and enhancement.

Our current inventory includes approximately 2,400 gallons of trichloroethylene (TCE) stored in steel drums within Building C, along with 1,800 gallons of perchloroethylene (PCE) maintained in similar containers in the adjacent storage area. These solvents are essential to our degreasing operations and vapor degreasing processes used in the preparation of metal components for our packaging machinery. Additionally, we maintain stocks of various cleaning agents, including carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane, which are utilized in our equipment maintenance protocols. The proximity of these storage areas to our production floor has proven efficient for daily operations, though I believe we should consider the long-term implications of this arrangement.

## Recommended Procedural Improvements

Based on my observations during the recent inspection, I recommend that we implement enhanced containment measures for all solvent storage areas. Currently, our chemical storage relies primarily on the structural integrity of the steel drums provided by our suppliers. However, I believe we should consider installing secondary containment systems, particularly for our larger volume storage areas. The concrete flooring in Building C shows some minor cracking near the drainage systems, and while this does not present an immediate operational concern, we should monitor these areas more closely to ensure continued integrity of our storage environment.

Furthermore, I suggest we establish more rigorous documentation procedures for chemical disposal activities. Our current practice involves coordination with approved waste haulers for the removal of spent solvents and contaminated materials, but our record-keeping could be enhanced to provide better tracking of disposal volumes and frequencies. This documentation would serve both our internal operational needs and any future regulatory requirements that may be established by state or federal authorities.

## Personnel Training and Safety Protocols

The safety of our workforce remains our paramount concern, and I recommend that we schedule additional training sessions for all personnel who handle chemical materials in their daily responsibilities. Our current safety protocols include the use of protective equipment and proper ventilation procedures, but we should ensure that all employees understand the importance of immediate reporting of any spills or unusual conditions in storage areas. The health and safety of our workers directly impacts our operational efficiency and our standing as a responsible corporate citizen in the East Woburn community.

I will coordinate with the Plant Safety Committee to schedule a comprehensive review meeting within the next two weeks to discuss these recommendations in greater detail. Please advise me of your availability for this important discussion regarding our chemical management procedures.
