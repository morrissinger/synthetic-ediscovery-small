# INTERNAL MEMORANDUM

**TO:** W.R. Grace Executive Management  
**FROM:** Real Estate Division, W.R. Grace Company  
**DATE:** May 22, 1960  
**RE:** Property Acquisition Completion - Washington Street Facility

## Acquisition Summary

The Real Estate Division is pleased to report the successful completion of property acquisition negotiations for the Washington Street industrial facility in East Woburn, Massachusetts. The transaction, finalized on May 18, 1960, represents a strategic expansion of our Massachusetts chemical manufacturing operations and positions W.R. Grace for increased production capacity in specialty chemical products.

The acquired property encompasses approximately 15.2 acres of industrial-zoned land located at 201-215 Washington Street, directly adjacent to existing transportation infrastructure including the Boston & Maine Railroad freight line. The facility includes three primary manufacturing buildings totaling 82,000 square feet of production space, administrative offices, and supporting warehouse facilities. Previous industrial use of the property by Dewey & Almy Chemical Company provides immediate operational advantages, as existing chemical processing equipment and waste management systems require minimal modification to accommodate our production requirements.

## Strategic Positioning and Operational Benefits

This acquisition significantly enhances our competitive position in the New England chemical manufacturing market. The Washington Street facility's proximity to the Aberjona River provides access to industrial water resources essential for our chemical processing operations, while the established rail connections ensure efficient transportation of raw materials and finished products. The property's location within East Woburn's established industrial corridor offers operational synergies with other chemical manufacturing facilities in the region.

Our engineering assessment indicates that existing infrastructure can accommodate immediate production of industrial solvents, including trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, which represent high-growth segments of our specialty chemicals division. The facility's waste management systems, including on-site disposal areas and drainage systems connecting to the regional groundwater system, meet current industrial standards and provide cost-effective solutions for manufacturing byproduct management.

## Financial and Regulatory Considerations

Total acquisition cost of $485,000 falls within approved capital expenditure parameters and represents excellent value given the facility's production capacity and strategic location. Local zoning compliance has been verified through Woburn municipal authorities, and all necessary industrial operating permits are currently in good standing. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has confirmed that our planned chemical manufacturing operations conform to existing industrial use classifications for the property.

Initial production operations are scheduled to commence June 15, 1960, with full operational capacity anticipated by August 1960. This timeline positions W.R. Grace to capture market opportunities in the expanding industrial solvent sector while leveraging our established distribution networks throughout New England.
