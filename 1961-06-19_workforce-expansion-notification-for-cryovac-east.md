# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** W.R. Grace Executive Management  
**FROM:** Robert H. Mitchell, Director of Human Resources  
**DATE:** June 19, 1961  
**RE:** Workforce Expansion Notification for Cryovac East Woburn Manufacturing Facility

## Purpose

This memorandum serves to notify executive management of the approved workforce expansion at our Cryovac division manufacturing facility located in East Woburn, Massachusetts. The expansion has been authorized to meet increasing demand for our specialized packaging materials and to optimize production capacity at this strategic location.

## Expansion Details

Effective July 1, 1961, the Cryovac East Woburn facility will increase its workforce by thirty-five (35) full-time production employees across two shifts. This expansion represents a 28% increase in manufacturing personnel at the facility and will bring total employment to approximately 160 workers. The new positions include twenty-two (22) machine operators, eight (8) quality control technicians, three (3) maintenance specialists, and two (2) shift supervisors.

The facility's current operations focus on the production of heat-shrinkable plastic films and specialized chemical packaging materials. With this workforce expansion, we anticipate a 40% increase in monthly production output, positioning the East Woburn facility as our primary Northeast manufacturing center for these product lines. The location's proximity to major transportation corridors and industrial infrastructure makes it ideally suited for this expanded role.

## Operational Considerations

The increased production capacity will require enhanced chemical storage and waste management protocols. Our facilities management team has confirmed adequate space for expanded raw material storage, including the various solvents and chemical compounds essential to our manufacturing processes. The existing waste disposal arrangements with local contractors remain sufficient for projected waste volumes, though we will monitor this closely as production ramps up.

Personnel recruitment for these positions has been highly successful, drawing from the skilled industrial workforce available in the greater Woburn area. Many of our new hires bring experience from other chemical manufacturing operations in the region, which should minimize training time and ensure rapid integration into our production systems.

## Financial Impact

The workforce expansion represents an investment of approximately $180,000 annually in additional wages and benefits. However, projected revenue increases from enhanced production capacity are estimated at $750,000 annually, providing a favorable return on this human resources investment. These figures align with our broader corporate objectives for growth in the specialty chemicals and packaging sectors.

We anticipate this expansion will strengthen W.R. Grace's competitive position in the Northeast market while maintaining our commitment to efficient, cost-effective manufacturing operations. The East Woburn facility continues to demonstrate its value as a key component of our manufacturing network.

Please contact my office if you require additional details regarding this workforce expansion or its implementation timeline.
