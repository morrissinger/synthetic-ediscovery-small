## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21, Section 43A and regulatory directive MEQ-71-0892 dated March 15, 1971, Cryovac Inc. hereby submits this comprehensive chemical usage report covering industrial operations at our Woburn manufacturing facility for the reporting period January 1, 1972 through October 31, 1972.

This report documents the types, quantities, and disposal methods of industrial chemicals utilized in our manufacturing processes, consistent with our commitment to environmental stewardship and regulatory compliance. All chemical handling and disposal activities have been conducted in accordance with prevailing industry standards and applicable state regulations.

## FACILITY OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

**Primary Manufacturing Activities:**
Cryovac Inc. operates a specialized packaging materials manufacturing facility focused on the production of flexible plastic packaging films and containers for food preservation applications. Our manufacturing processes involve the extrusion, lamination, and chemical treatment of polymer films to achieve desired barrier properties and heat-sealing characteristics.

**Production Capacity:**
During the reporting period, our facility maintained an average monthly production capacity of approximately 2.4 million linear feet of packaging film materials, with peak production months of June through September exceeding 2.8 million linear feet monthly.

**Employment:**
The facility maintains a workforce of 187 full-time employees across three production shifts, with additional seasonal employment during peak production periods.

## WASTE DISPOSAL METHODS

### Liquid Waste Streams

**Spent Solvents:**
Spent industrial solvents are collected in designated waste containers and transported for disposal by certified waste management contractors. During the reporting period, approximately 4,200 gallons of spent solvents were removed from the facility for off-site disposal.

Primary waste management contractor: Industrial Waste Management Services, Inc., located at 145 Industrial Boulevard, Woburn, Massachusetts. All waste shipments are documented with proper manifests and disposal certificates retained in facility records.

**Process Wastewater:**
Manufacturing process wastewater, including cooling water and equipment cleaning effluent, is directed to on-site clarification and treatment systems before discharge to the municipal sewer system. Average daily discharge volume approximates 8,500 gallons, with all discharges meeting applicable municipal pretreatment standards.

**Contaminated Rinse Water:**
Equipment cleaning and parts washing operations generate contaminated rinse water containing trace amounts of industrial solvents. This waste stream is collected in holding tanks and periodically removed for off-site treatment and disposal. Total volume for the reporting period: 2,800 gallons.

### Solid Waste Streams

**Contaminated Materials:**
Cleaning rags, absorbent materials, and other items contaminated with industrial chemicals are collected in sealed containers and disposed of through certified hazardous waste contractors. Total volume for reporting period: 12.4 cubic yards.

**Metal Scrap:**
Metal components and scrap materials potentially contaminated with cleaning solvents are segregated and disposed of through specialized metal recovery services that can properly handle contaminated materials.

## ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

**Air Quality Monitoring:**
Facility maintains continuous monitoring of workplace air quality in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. Monthly sampling results consistently demonstrate compliance with established exposure limits for all monitored chemical compounds.

**Groundwater Monitoring:**
In accordance with industry best practices, Cryovac Inc. has installed monitoring wells at strategic locations around the facility perimeter to assess potential impacts to groundwater quality. Quarterly sampling is conducted by certified environmental consultants, with results submitted to appropriate regulatory authorities.

Monitoring well locations:
- MW-1: Northeast facility boundary, 35 feet depth
- MW-2: Southeast facility boundary, 42 feet depth  
- MW-3: Southwest facility boundary, 38 feet depth

**Surface Water Assessment:**
Periodic sampling of nearby surface water bodies, including the Aberjona River, is conducted to ensure facility operations do not adversely impact local water resources.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Cryovac Inc. maintains comprehensive compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental regulations. During the reporting period, no violations or enforcement actions were issued by regulatory authorities.

**Permits and Authorizations:**
- Massachusetts Air Pollution Control Permit: APC-71-0445
- Municipal Sewer Discharge Permit: WOB-IND-68-012
- Hazardous Waste Generator Identification: MAD000567890

**Training and Certification:**
All employees involved in chemical handling operations receive comprehensive training in proper handling, storage, and disposal procedures. Training records are maintained in accordance with regulatory requirements.

## FUTURE PLANNING

Cryovac Inc. continues to evaluate opportunities for reducing chemical usage and implementing more environmentally sustainable manufacturing processes. Current initiatives include:

- Investigation of alternative cleaning solvents with reduced environmental impact
- Implementation of closed-loop solvent recovery systems to minimize waste generation
- Enhanced containment and monitoring systems for chemical storage areas
- Expansion of employee training programs focused on environmental protection
