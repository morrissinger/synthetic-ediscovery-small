## COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT WITH DIFFERENTIAL

**Specimen:** Venous blood collected in EDTA tube  
**Collection Time:** 7:30 AM, fasting specimen  

| Parameter | Result | Reference Range | Units |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| **White Blood Cell Count** | 2,100 | 4,500-15,500 | cells/μL |
| **Red Blood Cell Count** | 2.8 | 3.8-5.2 | million/μL |
| **Hemoglobin** | 7.2 | 11.5-15.5 | g/dL |
| **Hematocrit** | 21.5 | 35-45 | % |
| **Mean Corpuscular Volume** | 78 | 80-100 | fL |
| **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin** | 26 | 27-33 | pg |
| **Platelet Count** | 45,000 | 150,000-400,000 | cells/μL |

### Differential Count:
- **Neutrophils:** 35% (severely decreased)
- **Lymphocytes:** 58% (elevated)
- **Monocytes:** 4%
- **Eosinophils:** 2%
- **Basophils:** 1%
- **Blast Cells:** 15% (abnormal presence)

**Blood Smear Review:** Numerous immature lymphoid cells observed. Blast cells demonstrate high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio with prominent nucleoli. Red blood cells show mild anisocytosis and hypochromia. Thrombocytopenia confirmed.

## BONE MARROW BIOPSY EXAMINATION

**Specimen:** Bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy from posterior iliac crest  
**Procedure Date:** October 11, 1976  
**Pathologist:** Dr. Robert Chen, MD  

### Microscopic Examination:

**Cellularity:** Hypercellular marrow (85% cellular)

**Blast Cell Count:** 78% of nucleated cells

**Morphologic Findings:**  
The bone marrow demonstrates marked hypercellularity with predominance of lymphoblasts. These cells are medium-sized with scant basophilic cytoplasm, fine chromatin pattern, and prominent nucleoli. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining shows coarse granular positivity in blast cells. Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly reduced.

**Megakaryocytes:** Severely decreased in number

**Iron Stores:** Adequate

### Cytochemical Studies:
- **Myeloperoxidase:** Negative
- **Sudan Black B:** Negative  
- **PAS:** Positive (coarse granular pattern)
- **Acid Phosphatase:** Focally positive

## CLINICAL CORRELATION AND INTERPRETATION

### Primary Findings:
The laboratory results demonstrate severe pancytopenia with the presence of circulating blast cells. The bone marrow examination reveals hypercellular marrow with 78% lymphoblasts, consistent with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).

### Specific Observations:
1. **Severe Anemia:** Hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL indicates significant oxygen-carrying capacity compromise
2. **Profound Neutropenia:** White cell count of 2,100 with only 35% neutrophils places patient at extreme infection risk
3. **Thrombocytopenia:** Platelet count of 45,000 indicates high bleeding risk
4. **Blast Cell Infiltration:** 78% bone marrow replacement by malignant cells

### Disease Classification:
**Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, L1 subtype** (French-American-British classification)

The morphologic and cytochemical features are characteristic of childhood ALL. The patient's age (8 years) and presentation are typical for this malignancy, though the degree of bone marrow involvement at diagnosis suggests aggressive disease progression.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Clinical Actions:
1. **Urgent Hematology-Oncology consultation** for treatment protocol initiation
2. **Infection precautions** due to severe neutropenia
3. **Bleeding precautions** due to thrombocytopenia
4. **Blood product support** as clinically indicated

### Monitoring Requirements:
- Daily complete blood counts during induction therapy
- Frequent bone marrow examinations to assess treatment response
- Supportive care measures including antimicrobial prophylaxis

### Prognosis:
While acute lymphocytic leukemia in children has shown improved outcomes with current treatment protocols, the extensive bone marrow involvement and degree of cytopenias at presentation indicate a challenging clinical course requiring intensive chemotherapy and supportive care.
