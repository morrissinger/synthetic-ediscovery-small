# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Municipal Laboratory Staff  
**FROM:** Robert F. McKenzie, Water Department Supervisor  
**DATE:** August 25, 1965  
**RE:** Routine Water Quality Testing Schedule and Procedures

This memorandum establishes the updated water quality testing schedule and procedures for all municipal water sources, effective September 1, 1965. With the addition of Well G to our water supply system last year and the anticipated opening of Well H in the coming months, it is essential that we maintain rigorous testing protocols to ensure the continued safety and quality of water delivered to our 35,000 residents.

**Testing Schedule:**

All active wells (Wells A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) shall be tested according to the following schedule:
- **Bacteriological testing:** Weekly samples from each well
- **Chemical analysis:** Monthly comprehensive testing including pH, chloride content, iron, manganese, and hardness levels
- **Turbidity and color assessment:** Bi-weekly visual and instrumental evaluation
- **Special testing:** Quarterly analysis for any unusual taste, odor, or appearance complaints from residents

For Wells G and the forthcoming Well H, given their location in the eastern section of the city near industrial facilities, additional precautionary measures are warranted:
- **Enhanced chemical screening:** Include testing for petroleum-based compounds and industrial solvents on a monthly basis
- **Increased sampling frequency:** Bi-weekly bacteriological testing during the first six months of operation
- **Coordination with state authorities:** Submit quarterly reports to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health as requested

**Sample Collection Procedures:**

Laboratory staff must ensure proper sample collection techniques to maintain accuracy and prevent contamination. All samples should be collected in sterile containers provided by the State Laboratory, with proper chain of custody documentation. Samples from Wells G and H should be collected from the wellhead prior to any treatment or chlorination processes. Any unusual readings or concerning results must be reported immediately to this office and to the City Health Department.

**Documentation and Reporting:**

Maintain detailed records of all test results in the departmental logbooks, with copies forwarded to the Mayor's office monthly. Any results that exceed state guidelines or show unusual variations from baseline readings require immediate notification to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and this office. Given the industrial activity in the vicinity of our eastern wells, particular attention should be paid to any chemical signatures that might indicate groundwater contamination from upgradient sources.

The safety of our municipal water supply is our primary responsibility to the citizens of Woburn. These testing protocols, while comprehensive, represent the minimum standards necessary to fulfill our obligations to public health and safety.
