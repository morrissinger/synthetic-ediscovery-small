## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the final construction specifications and operational parameters for Municipal Well G, located in the eastern section of Woburn, Massachusetts. The well has been successfully drilled and tested in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations and American Water Works Association standards. Well G represents a significant addition to our municipal water supply infrastructure, providing supplemental capacity to serve our growing community of 35,000 residents.

## WELL LOCATION AND SITE DESCRIPTION

**Coordinates:** 42°30'15"N, 71°08'42"W  
**Street Address:** Adjacent to Aberjona River, approximately 400 feet east of Salem Street  
**Lot Description:** City-owned parcel, Assessor's Map 15, Lot 3A  
**Elevation:** 45 feet above mean sea level  
**Zoning:** Industrial/Residential Mixed Use

The well site is positioned within the Aberjona River watershed, situated in a deep north-south trending bedrock trench that serves as a natural groundwater collection system for the eastern portion of Woburn. The location provides optimal access to the regional aquifer while maintaining adequate distance from existing municipal and private wells to prevent interference.

- **Motor:** 15 horsepower, 1800 RPM, 3-phase, 440 volt
- **Pump Setting:** 75 feet below ground surface

### Wellhead Construction
- **Casing Extension:** 18 inches above grade
- **Wellhead Seal:** Mechanical packer at 60 feet depth
- **Access Port:** 4-inch diameter sampling port with locking cap
- **Electrical Service:** 440V, 3-phase service from existing distribution line
- **Control Panel:** NEMA 4 enclosure with motor starter and controls

## AQUIFER CHARACTERISTICS AND YIELD DATA

### Geological Formation
The well penetrates through approximately 25 feet of glacial till and sand before entering the primary water-bearing formation consisting of medium to coarse glacial outwash deposits. The aquifer extends to bedrock at approximately 95 feet depth, though the well terminates at 88 feet to optimize yield and water quality.

### Pump Test Results
A 72-hour constant rate pump test was conducted from December 10-13, 1963, under the supervision of Whitman & Howard, Inc., consulting engineers. Test results are summarized below:

**Pumping Rate:** 150 gallons per minute (constant)  
**Static Water Level:** 28 feet below ground surface  
**Pumping Water Level:** 52 feet below ground surface (after 72 hours)  
**Drawdown:** 24 feet  
**Specific Capacity:** 6.25 gallons per minute per foot of drawdown  
**Transmissivity:** 2,100 gallons per day per foot  
**Storage Coefficient:** 0.0015 (confined aquifer characteristics)

Recovery testing indicated full static level restoration within 8 hours of pump shutdown, confirming sustainable yield capacity.

## WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS

Initial water quality sampling was conducted on January 8, 1964, by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Laboratory, Boston. Results indicate compliance with all applicable drinking water standards:

### Physical Parameters
- **Temperature:** 52°F
- **pH:** 6.8
- **Turbidity:** 0.5 NTU
- **Color:** 5 units
- **Odor:** None detected

### Chemical Analysis
- **Total Dissolved Solids:** 245 mg/L
- **Hardness (as CaCO₃):** 125 mg/L
- **Chloride:** 18 mg/L
- **Sulfate:** 35 mg/L
- **Iron:** 0.15 mg/L
- **Manganese:** 0.08 mg/L
- **Nitrate (as N):** 2.1 mg/L

### Bacteriological Analysis
- **Total Coliform:** Absent in 100 mL sample
- **E. coli:** Absent in 100 mL sample

All parameters meet or exceed Massachusetts drinking water standards and USPHS drinking water guidelines.

## DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### Connection Points
Well G connects to the municipal distribution system via a 10-inch ductile iron main extending 1,200 feet westward to the existing transmission main on Salem Street. The connection includes:

- **Master Valve:** 10-inch gate valve with indicator post
- **Flow Meter:** 10-inch turbine meter with totalizing register
- **Pressure Gauge:** 0-200 PSI range with maximum reading pointer
- **Sampling Station:** Dedicated sampling tap with sterile connection

### Service Area
Well G is designed to serve as a supplemental source for the East Woburn distribution zone, particularly residential areas east of Main Street (Route 38). The well can operate independently or in conjunction with existing sources depending on system demand.

### Operational Capacity
Under normal operating conditions, Well G can provide:
- **Continuous Operation:** 150 GPM (216,000 gallons per day)
- **Peak Demand Support:** Up to 200 GPM for periods not exceeding 4 hours
- **Emergency Backup:** Available as standby source with manual activation

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

This installation has been approved by:
- **Massachusetts Department of Public Health** - Water Supply Permit #WS-642-1963
- **City of Woburn Board of Health** - Construction Permit dated November 15, 1963
- **Massachusetts Department of Public Works** - Groundwater Withdrawal Permit #GW-1963-0847

All construction has been performed in accordance with:
- Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, Chapter IV
- American Water Works Association Standard A100-63
- National Sanitation Foundation Standard 14

## MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS

### Water Quality Monitoring
- **Bacteriological Testing:** Monthly samples to State Laboratory
- **Chemical Analysis:** Annual comprehensive analysis
- **Physical Parameters:** Quarterly measurement of temperature, pH, turbidity

### Equipment Maintenance
- **Pump Service:** Semi-annual inspection and lubrication
- **Motor Maintenance:** Annual electrical testing and bearing service
- **Well Development:** Annual assessment for potential rehabilitation needs

### Record Keeping
- **Daily Operation Log:** Pumping hours, flow rates, pressure readings
- **Monthly Reports:** Total production, water quality results, maintenance activities
- **Annual Assessment:** Comprehensive evaluation of well performance and condition

## OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Initial Operation:** Begin with intermittent operation during peak demand periods to allow gradual integration with existing system hydraulics

2. **Quality Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring schedule for first six months of operation to establish baseline performance data

3. **System Optimization:** Coordinate Well G operation with existing sources to maximize system efficiency an
