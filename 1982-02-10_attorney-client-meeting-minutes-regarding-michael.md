Mr. and Mrs. Zona presented for initial consultation regarding potential wrongful death claims arising from the death of their son, Michael Zona, age 4, who died on July 2, 1981, following a battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The family resided at 52 Salem Street, Woburn, Massachusetts, for the entirety of Michael's life.

**Key Factual Elements Established:**

- **Treatment:** Received treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital under Dr. Patricia Giardina's care
- **Death:** Occurred July 2, 1981, at Massachusetts General Hospital due to complications from leukemia

Mrs. Zona confirmed that she consumed municipal water throughout her pregnancy with Michael and that all household water for drinking, cooking, and bathing came from the municipal wells. The family was unaware of any water quality issues until recent community discussions following other childhood leukemia cases in the area.
