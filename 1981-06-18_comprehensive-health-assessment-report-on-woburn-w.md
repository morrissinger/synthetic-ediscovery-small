# COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH ASSESSMENT REPORT ON WOBURN WATER CONTAMINATION IMPACT

**Prepared for:** Massachusetts Legislature  
**Prepared by:** Dr. Margaret Whitmore, Director of Environmental Health Assessment  
**Date:** June 18, 1981  
**Report Classification:** Urgent Public Health Assessment

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This comprehensive health assessment examines the documented correlation between municipal water contamination in Woburn, Massachusetts, and an unprecedented cluster of childhood leukemia cases in the East Woburn area. Our investigation reveals a statistically significant elevation in acute lymphocytic leukemia incidence among children served by municipal Wells G and H, which have been contaminated with industrial solvents including trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) at concentrations far exceeding safe exposure limits.

The death of James Anderson on January 18, 1981, at age twelve, represents the most recent fatality in what appears to be an ongoing public health emergency. Our preliminary findings indicate that the contamination of Wells G and H, which began operations in 1964 and 1966 respectively, has exposed approximately 5,000 residents to carcinogenic chemicals through their municipal water supply for nearly two decades.

## METHODOLOGY

### Data Collection Period
January 1970 - May 1981

### Study Population
- Primary focus: Children aged 0-19 residing in East Woburn
- Geographic boundary: Areas served by municipal Wells G and H
- Control population: Children in West Woburn served by alternate water sources
- Total households surveyed: 847
- Total individuals assessed: 2,341

### Water Quality Analysis
Water samples were collected from Wells G and H on the following dates:
- May 22, 1979: Initial detection of volatile organic compounds
- September 15, 1980: Comprehensive chemical analysis
- March 10, 1981: Follow-up contamination assessment
- May 28, 1981: Pre-closure testing

Laboratory analysis was conducted by the Massachusetts State Laboratory Institute using EPA-approved methodologies for volatile organic compound detection.

## FINDINGS

### Water Contamination Levels

**Well G (Opened 1964):**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 267 parts per billion (ppb)
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 21 ppb
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 12 ppb
- Chloroform: 8 ppb

**Well H (Opened 1966):**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 183 ppb
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 43 ppb
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 7 ppb

**Reference Standards:**
- EPA proposed MCL for TCE: 2.7 ppb (based on 1 in 1,000,000 cancer risk)
- Current detection represents 60-148 times proposed safe levels

### Health Impact Assessment

#### Childhood Leukemia Cluster Analysis

Our epidemiological investigation has identified twelve confirmed cases of childhood leukemia among residents served by Wells G and H between 1969 and 1981. This represents an incidence rate of 9.7 cases per 10,000 children, compared to the expected rate of 0.4 cases per 10,000 children for this age group.

**Confirmed Cases:**
1. **James Anderson** (DOB: 07/16/1968, DOD: 01/18/1981)
   - Address: 11 Orange Street
   - Diagnosis: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (January 1972, age 3)
   - Water exposure: Prenatal through death (Wells G & H)

2. **Kevin Kane Jr.** (DOB: 03/22/1963)
   - Address: 14 Maple Street
   - Diagnosis: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (August 1970, age 7)
   - Current status: In remission

3. **Michael Zona** (DOB: 11/08/1965)
   - Address: 52 Pine Street
   - Diagnosis: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (September 1973, age 8)
   - Current status: Deceased (April 1974)

4. **Patrick Toomey** (DOB: 05/14/1967)
   - Address: 18 Salem Street
   - Diagnosis: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (June 1975, age 8)
   - Current status: In treatment

5. **Carl Robbins III** (DOB: 02/28/1969)
   - Address: 6 Forest Street
   - Diagnosis: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (November 1976, age 7)
   - Current status: In remission

6. **Roland Gamache** (DOB: 09/12/1964)
   - Address: 23 Oak Street
   - Diagnosis: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (March 1971, age 6)
   - Current status: Deceased (January 1973)

[Additional cases documented with similar exposure patterns]

#### Statistical Analysis

The observed-to-expected ratio for childhood leukemia in the study area is 24.25, with a 95% confidence interval of 15.8-37.2. The probability of this cluster occurring by chance alone is less than 0.001 (p < 0.001), indicating statistical significance far exceeding conventional thresholds.

#### Temporal Correlation

Analysis reveals a clear temporal relationship between well operation and leukemia diagnoses:
- Pre-1964 (before Well G operation): 0 cases
- 1964-1966 (Well G only): 1 case
- 1966-1981 (both wells operating): 11 cases

The latency period between initial exposure and diagnosis ranges from 18 months to 8 years, consistent with known carcinogenic effects of chlorinated solvents.

### Additional Health Effects

Beyond the leukemia cluster, our assessment has identified elevated rates of:
- Birth defects: 3.2% vs. expected 1.8%
- Childhood kidney disorders: 12 documented cases
- Nervous system disorders: 8 documented cases
- Reproductive health impacts: 6 documented pregnancy complications

## CONTAMINATION SOURCES

### Industrial Facilities Investigation

Our investigation has identified four primary industrial facilities as potential contamination sources:

1. **W.R. Grace Company (Cryovac Division)**
   - Location: 300 Washington Street
   - Operations: Food packaging materials manufacturing
   - Chemicals used: TCE, PCE, various chlorinated solvents
   - Disposal practices: On-site lagoons, direct discharge (1954-1980)

2. **Beatrice Foods Company**
   - Location: 2 Olympia Avenue
   - Operations: Food processing and packaging
   - Chemicals used: TCE for degreasing operations
   - Disposal practices: Underground storage, surface discharge

3. **John J. Riley Company**
   - Location: 400 Washington Street
   - Operations: Tannery and leather processing
   - Chemicals used: Various organic solvents
   - Disposal practices: Direct discharge to wetlands area

### Hydrogeological Assessment

Groundwater flow analysis indicates contamination migration from industrial sites toward municipal well locations. The permeable glacial outwash deposits underlying East Woburn facilitate rapid contaminant transport, with estimated travel times of 3-7 years from source areas to well heads.

## REGULATORY RESPONSE

### Well Closure Actions

On May 22, 1979, following initial detection of contamination, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health issued an advisory regarding Wells G and H. However, the wells remained operational with periodic monitoring until May 29, 1981, when both wells were permanently closed following our preliminary health assessment findings.

### EPA Involvement

The Environmental Protection Agency has been notified of our findings and has initiated preliminary discussions regarding potential Superfun
