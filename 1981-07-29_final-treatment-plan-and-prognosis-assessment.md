## CLINICAL HISTORY

Carl Robbins III, a 14-year-old male from Woburn, Massachusetts, was initially diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in September 1979 at age 12. The patient has been under continuous treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital for the past 22 months. His residential address at 42 Maple Street, Woburn, places him within the geographic cluster of pediatric leukemia cases that have emerged in the East Woburn area over the past decade.

The patient's mother, Donna Robbins, has been his primary caregiver throughout his illness. Family history reveals no known genetic predisposition to hematologic malignancies. Environmental history indicates the family has resided at the same address since 1965, receiving municipal water from Wells G and H throughout the patient's lifetime, including the prenatal period.

## CURRENT CLINICAL STATUS

### Physical Examination Findings (July 29, 1981)
- **General Appearance:** Pale, thin 14-year-old male appearing chronically ill
- **Weight:** 78 lbs (significant weight loss from baseline of 95 lbs at diagnosis)
- **Height:** 5'2" (growth retardation noted)
- **Vital Signs:** Temperature 99.8°F, Pulse 110 bpm, Respirations 22/min, Blood Pressure 95/60
- **HEENT:** Pallor of conjunctiva and oral mucosa, no lymphadenopathy
- **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardia, no murmurs

  - Hemoglobin: 6.8 g/dL (severely anemic)
  - Hematocrit: 20.1%
  - Platelet Count: 15,000/μL (critically low)
  - Blast Cells: 85% (indicating active leukemia)

- **Chemistry Panel:**
  - Blood Urea Nitrogen: 45 mg/dL (elevated)
  - Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL (elevated, indicating kidney involvement)
  - Liver Function Tests: Elevated transaminases consistent with hepatic involvement

- **Bone Marrow Biopsy (July 25, 1981):** 90% blast cells, consistent with relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia, resistant to current therapeutic regimen

## TREATMENT HISTORY AND RESPONSE

Carl has undergone multiple treatment protocols since his initial diagnosis:

### Phase I (September 1979 - March 1980): Initial Induction Therapy
- **Protocol:** Standard ALL induction with vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase
- **Response:** Achieved complete remission by December 1979
- **Complications:** Severe mucositis, peripheral neuropathy from vincristine

### Phase II (April 1980 - January 1981): Consolidation and Maintenance
- **Protocol:** Methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine maintenance therapy
- **Response:** Maintained remission for 10 months
- **Complications:** Chronic nausea, intermittent infections due to immunosuppression

### Phase III (February 1981 - Present): Relapse and Salvage Therapy
- **First Relapse:** February 15, 1981 - CNS involvement detected
- **Salvage Protocol:** High-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin
- **Response:** Partial response only, disease progression noted by May 1981
- **Second Salvage:** Experimental protocol with high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue
- **Current Status:** Refractory disease with rapid progression

## PAIN AND SUFFERING ASSESSMENT

Throughout his 22-month treatment course, Carl has experienced significant conscious pain and suffering:

### Physical Suffering
- **Chronic Pain:** Bone pain rated 7-8/10 on pediatric pain scale, requiring continuous narcotic analgesia
- **Treatment-Related Pain:** Multiple painful procedures including 15 bone marrow biopsies, 8 lumbar punctures, and countless venipunctures
- **Neuropathic Pain:** Peripheral neuropathy from vincristine causing burning sensations in hands and feet
- **Mucositis:** Severe oral and gastrointestinal mucositis causing difficulty eating and speaking
- **Infections:** Recurrent infections due to immunosuppression, including pneumonia requiring hospitalization

### Psychological and Emotional Suffering
- **Anxiety and Fear:** Documented anxiety regarding procedures and prognosis
- **Depression:** Clinical depression noted, requiring psychiatric consultation in March 1981
- **Social Isolation:** Unable to attend school regularly or participate in normal adolescent activities
- **Body Image Issues:** Significant weight loss and physical changes affecting self-esteem
- **Anticipatory Grief:** Patient demonstrates awareness of poor prognosis, expressing fears about death

### Impact on Quality of Life
- **Functional Decline:** Karnofsky Performance Status decreased from 90% at diagnosis to current 30%
- **Educational Disruption:** Missed approximately 60% of school days over past two years
- **Family Impact:** Significant emotional and financial burden on family unit

## CURRENT PROGNOSIS

Based on current clinical status, laboratory findings, and response to therapy, Carl's prognosis is grave:

### Medical Assessment
- **Disease Status:** Refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia with multi-organ involvement
- **Treatment Options:** Limited salvage options remain; experimental protocols may be considered
- **Expected Survival:** Without miraculous response to treatment, survival is estimated at 2-4 months
- **Quality vs. Quantity:** Further aggressive treatment likely to increase suffering without meaningful benefit

### Recommendations for Care
1. **Transition to Comfort Care:** Recommend discussing goals of care with family
2. **Pain Management:** Maximize comfort with appropriate analgesic regimen
3. **Palliative Consultation:** Referral to palliative care team for comprehensive comfort planning
4. **Family Support:** Continued social work and chaplain services for family coping
5. **Home Care Coordination:** Arrange for hospice services if family desires home care

## DISCUSSION WITH FAMILY

Mrs. Donna Robbins was present for today's consultation. The gravity of Carl's condition was discussed in detail, including:

- Current disease status and lack of response to treatment
- Limited remaining treatment options and their associated risks
- Estimated prognosis and timeline
- Transition to comfort-focused care
- Available support services for patient and family

Mrs. Robbins expressed understanding of the situation and requested time to discuss options with her family. She has been an exemplary advocate for her son throughout his illness, demonstrating remarkable strength in the face of this devastating diagnosis.
