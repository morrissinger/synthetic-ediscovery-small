# Phone Call Log

**March 26, 1981**
**10:00 AM**

Dear Anne,

I wanted to write down what we talked about this morning while it's still fresh in my mind. I know we've both been struggling since we lost our boys, and I think it helps to have these conversations documented, especially with everything that's been happening around town.

When you called this morning, you sounded so tired, and I can understand why. It's been over two months since we lost James on January 18th, and I know the pain hasn't gotten any easier. Patrick has been gone since September 22nd last year, and there are still days when I wake up expecting to hear him asking for breakfast or see him getting ready for school. The house feels so empty without his voice echoing through the halls.

What struck me most about our conversation was when you mentioned how James suffered those final weeks. You described how he would wake up crying from the pain, how the treatments made him so sick he couldn't keep anything down, and how he kept asking you when he was going to feel better. Anne, when you told me about holding his hand in that hospital room and watching him struggle to breathe, it brought back all those memories of Patrick's final days. The way these children suffered - it wasn't just the leukemia, it was everything that came with it. The constant fear in their eyes, the way they tried to be brave for us even when they were in so much pain.

I've been thinking a lot about what you said regarding the water situation. You mentioned that James drank the tap water his entire life, from the time you were pregnant with him right up until he got sick. Same with Patrick - he was born in 1971, and we've lived on Marshall Street since 1969, getting our water from those same municipal wells. It makes me wonder if there's some connection we're not seeing. You said James was diagnosed when he was only three years old, back in January 1972. Patrick was diagnosed in 1978 when he was seven. Both of our boys, drinking the same water, playing in the same neighborhoods, and both developing the same terrible disease.

The more I think about it, the more troubled I become. During our conversation, you mentioned that you'd heard rumors about other children in the area getting sick. We talked about the Zona boy - little Michael - and how his family has been going through the same nightmare we have. Then there's the Kane family and the Robbins family. It's starting to feel like more than just a terrible coincidence. When you mentioned that you've been keeping track of these cases, it made me realize that maybe we should be doing something more than just grieving separately.

Anne, I want you to know that when you described James's final moments, how he looked at you with those big eyes and tried to smile even though he was in so much pain, it reminded me of Patrick's last day. He kept apologizing to me, as if somehow this was his fault. These children carried such a burden, trying to protect us from their suffering even as they were dying. The conscious awareness they had of their own pain, the way they fought so hard to stay with us - it's something that will haunt me forever.

I think about all the times I gave Patrick water from the tap, made his bottles with it when he was a baby, cooked his meals with it. Like you said about James, I never questioned whether the water was safe. Why would we? It came from the city, it was supposed to be clean. But now I keep wondering if every glass of water I gave him was somehow contributing to his illness. The guilt is overwhelming some days.

What you said about wanting to find out more information resonates with me. If there really is something wrong with the water supply, if there's some contamination that's making our children sick, then other families need to know. Other mothers shouldn't have to go through what we've been through. The thought that James and Patrick might have died from something preventable, something that could have been avoided if we'd known the truth about our water supply, makes their loss even more unbearable.

I agreed when you suggested we should start talking to other families in the area. Maybe if we pool our information, we can figure out if there's a pattern here. You mentioned wanting to contact someone who might be able to help us understand what's happening. I think that's a good idea. These children deserved better than what they got, and if their deaths can somehow prevent other families from going through this nightmare, then maybe we can find some meaning in our loss.

Anne, I know we're both still deep in our grief, but I feel like we owe it to James and Patrick and all the other children to keep asking questions. Their suffering was real, their pain was conscious and prolonged, and if there's any chance that someone is responsible for what happened to them, we need to find out the truth.

Please keep me informed of anything else you learn. I'll do the same. We can't bring our boys back, but maybe we can make sure their deaths weren't in vain.

With love and shared sorrow,

Mary Toomey
47 Marshall Street
Woburn, Massachusetts

P.S. - I found Patrick's medical records from Children's Hospital if you think they might be helpful for whatever investigation you're considering. The documentation of his pain and suffering during those final months is all there in the doctors' notes.
