## CHIEF COMPLAINT

Eight-year-old male presenting for routine follow-up appointment regarding acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosis established February 14, 1979. Patient continues on maintenance chemotherapy protocol.

---

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Kevin Kane Jr. is an 8-year-old male who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in February 1979 following a three-week history of fatigue, pallor, and recurrent infections. Initial presentation included fever, petechiae, and lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed diagnosis of B-cell precursor ALL with initial white blood cell count of 47,000/μL.

Patient has been receiving treatment according to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 79-01, initiated March 1979. Induction phase completed successfully with achievement of complete remission by day 28. Currently in consolidation phase of treatment.

Since last visit (June 12, 1979), parents report patient has experienced moderate fatigue and decreased appetite. No fever, bleeding, or signs of infection noted. Patient has maintained reasonable energy levels for age-appropriate activities but requires more rest than prior to illness onset.

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

**Primary Diagnosis:** Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-cell precursor), currently in complete remission on maintenance therapy.

**Assessment:** Kevin continues to demonstrate excellent response to treatment with maintenance of complete remission. Laboratory values show expected mild myelosuppression consistent with current chemotherapy regimen. Weight loss of 3 pounds since last visit is concerning and will require close monitoring. Overall clinical status remains stable.

**Plan:**

1. **Continue Current Chemotherapy Protocol:** Maintain Dana-Farber ALL Consortium Protocol 79-01 consolidation phase:
   - Methotrexate 20 mg/m² PO weekly (Mondays)
   - 6-Mercaptopurine 75 mg/m² PO daily
   - Vincristine 1.5 mg/m² IV monthly
   - Prednisone 40 mg/m² PO daily x 5 days monthly

2. **Monitoring:** Weekly CBC with differential for next 4 weeks. Hold chemotherapy if ANC <1,000 or platelets <75,000.

3. **Nutritional Support:** Dietitian consultation scheduled for July 17, 1979. Encourage high-calorie, high-protein diet. Consider nutritional supplements if weight loss continues.

4. **Infection Precautions:** Continue standard precautions. Avoid live vaccines. Notify immediately if fever >100.4°F.

5. **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 4 weeks (August 7, 1979) for routine monitoring. Earlier return if concerns arise.

6. **Family Education:** Discussed signs and symptoms requiring immediate medical attention. Emphasized importance of medication compliance and infection prevention measures.

## PROGNOSIS

Prognosis remains favorable given excellent initial response to induction therapy and maintenance of complete remission. Expected 5-year event-free survival rate for pediatric B-cell precursor ALL with current treatment protocols is approximately 70-75%.

---

## NOTES

Patient's family has expressed concerns about potential environmental factors contributing to diagnosis, particularly regarding municipal water supply in East Woburn area. Family reports awareness of other pediatric leukemia cases in their neighborhood. Discussed current understanding of leukemia etiology and recommended continued focus on optimal treatment adherence.

Social worker referral provided for family support services and connection with other families managing pediatric leukemia.
