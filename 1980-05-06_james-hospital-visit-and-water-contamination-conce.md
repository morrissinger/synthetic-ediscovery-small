# May 6, 1980

I'm sitting here at the kitchen table trying to make sense of what Dr. Truman told us today about Jimmy. My hands are still shaking as I write this. The appointment was at 9:30 this morning at Mass General, and Charles took time off from work to come with us. Jimmy has been so tired lately, more tired than any eight-year-old should be, and those bruises on his legs just won't heal properly.

Dr. Truman was very gentle with Jimmy during the examination, but I could see the concern in his eyes when he felt the lymph nodes in Jimmy's neck. He asked us to step outside while he drew more blood for additional tests. Jimmy was so brave - he didn't even cry this time, though I know those needles hurt. When we came back in, Dr. Truman sat us down and used words I'd never heard before. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He said they need to run more tests to be absolutely certain, but the preliminary blood work is very concerning. My beautiful boy, my Jimmy, might have cancer.

The drive home was the longest twenty minutes of my life. Jimmy fell asleep in the backseat, exhausted from the morning's ordeal, and Charles and I didn't say a word to each other until we pulled into our driveway on East Street. Then Charles just put his head in his hands and said, "How can this be happening?" I don't have an answer for him. How can an eight-year-old get leukemia? Dr. Truman said they don't always know what causes it, but that's not good enough for me. Something has to cause it.

I keep thinking about the conversation I had with Donna Robbins last month at the grocery store. Her boy Carl has been sick too - different symptoms, but sick nonetheless. And there was something she said about the water tasting funny sometimes, especially in the summer months. I never paid much attention to it before, but now I'm wondering. Could there be something wrong with our water? The wells that serve our neighborhood are relatively new - they opened when Jimmy was just a baby. Before that, we got our water from the older wells on the other side of town.

Tonight after Jimmy went to bed, I called my sister Mary in Medford and told her about the diagnosis. She was quiet for a long time, then said something that chilled me to the bone. She said there have been rumors about problems with some of the industrial companies in East Woburn - something about chemicals and improper disposal. Mary works for the state environmental office, and she hears things. She promised to look into it quietly and let me know what she finds out.

I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see Jimmy's pale face on that examination table. He's been complaining about feeling sick to his stomach for weeks now, and I just thought it was a stomach bug that wouldn't go away. The doctor said the nausea and fatigue are consistent with what he suspects Jimmy has. Consistent with leukemia. I can barely write those words.

Charles is already talking about getting a second opinion, maybe taking Jimmy to Children's Hospital in Boston. The medical bills are going to be enormous, but we'll figure it out somehow. We have to. Jimmy is everything to us. He's our only child, our miracle baby after years of trying. The thought of losing him is unbearable.

I keep going back to what Mary said about the industrial companies. W.R. Grace has that big facility not far from here, and there's the Beatrice Foods tannery operation too. I drive past both of them sometimes when I'm running errands. Could they be putting something in our water? It sounds crazy when I write it down, but what if it's not crazy? What if there's a connection?

Tomorrow I'm going to start keeping track of everything - Jimmy's symptoms, when they started, what we've noticed about the water, anything that might be important later. I have a feeling we're going to need all the information we can gather. If someone has made my child sick through negligence or carelessness, they're going to answer for it. No mother should have to watch her child suffer like this, especially if it could have been prevented.

Dr. Truman wants to see Jimmy again on Thursday for the test results. Three more days of not knowing for certain, three more days of watching my little boy struggle with fatigue and nausea while trying to pretend everything is normal. But I know in my heart what those tests are going to show. A mother knows these things.

I pray I'm wrong, but I don't think I am. And if I'm right about the leukemia, then I'm going to find out if I'm right about the water too. Someone needs to be held accountable for what's happening to the children in this neighborhood. Jimmy deserves that much. All our children deserve that much.

The house is so quiet now. Charles finally fell asleep an hour ago, but I can hear him tossing and turning. We're both scared, though we're trying to be strong for Jimmy. Tomorrow I'll call Mary again and ask her to be more specific about what she's heard regarding the industrial facilities. I'll also start making a list of other families in the neighborhood who might have noticed health problems with their children.

If there's a connection between our water supply and what's happening to Jimmy, I'm going to find it. No matter how long it takes or how hard the fight becomes, I'm going to find the truth.
