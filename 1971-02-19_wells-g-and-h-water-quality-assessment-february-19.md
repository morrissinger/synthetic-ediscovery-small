## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the findings of routine water quality testing conducted on Wells G and H during February 1971. Both wells continue to meet Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards for municipal water supply. Minor variations in chemical composition have been noted compared to previous testing periods, but all parameters remain within acceptable limits for public consumption.

## INTRODUCTION

Wells G and H serve as supplemental water sources for the Woburn municipal water system, primarily serving residential areas east of Main Street (Route 38). Well G was commissioned in 1964 at a depth of 88 feet, while Well H became operational in 1966 at a depth of 90 feet. Both wells draw from the Aberjona River watershed aquifer system.

Regular water quality monitoring is conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations (105 CMR 460.000) and federal Safe Drinking Water Act guidelines. This assessment covers the period from February 1-15, 1971.

## METHODOLOGY

### Sampling Protocol
Water samples were collected from both wells using standard sterile collection procedures. Samples were drawn directly from well heads after a minimum 10-minute purge cycle to ensure representative groundwater samples. Collection occurred during normal operational periods when wells were actively pumping.

### Testing Parameters
The following parameters were analyzed at the Woburn Water Department laboratory facility:

- **Physical Properties:** Color, odor, turbidity, temperature
- **Chemical Analysis:** pH, total dissolved solids, chloride, sulfate, iron, manganese
- **Bacteriological Testing:** Total coliform count, E. coli presence
- **Hardness:** Calcium and magnesium content

### Laboratory Methods
All testing was performed using standard methods approved by the American Water Works Association and Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Bacteriological samples were processed within 6 hours of collection using membrane filtration techniques.

## FINDINGS

### Well G Results (February 1971)

| Parameter | Result | Units | Standard Limit | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------------|--------|
| pH | 6.8 | pH units | 6.5-8.5 | Acceptable |
| Total Dissolved Solids | 245 | mg/L | 500 | Acceptable |
| Chloride | 28 | mg/L | 250 | Acceptable |
| Sulfate | 15 | mg/L | 250 | Acceptable |
| Iron | 0.12 | mg/L | 0.30 | Acceptable |
| Manganese | 0.03 | mg/L | 0.05 | Acceptable |
| Total Coliform | 0 | colonies/100mL | 0 | Acceptable |
| Turbidity | 1.2 | NTU | 4.0 | Acceptable |
| Color | 5 | color units | 15 | Acceptable |
| Odor | None | - | None | Acceptable |

### Well H Results (February 1971)

| Parameter | Result | Units | Standard Limit | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------------|--------|
| pH | 6.9 | pH units | 6.5-8.5 | Acceptable |
| Total Dissolved Solids | 268 | mg/L | 500 | Acceptable |
| Chloride | 32 | mg/L | 250 | Acceptable |
| Sulfate | 18 | mg/L | 250 | Acceptable |
| Iron | 0.15 | mg/L | 0.30 | Acceptable |
| Manganese | 0.04 | mg/L | 0.05 | Acceptable |
| Total Coliform | 0 | colonies/100mL | 0 | Acceptable |
| Turbidity | 1.5 | NTU | 4.0 | Acceptable |
| Color | 8 | color units | 15 | Acceptable |
| Odor | None | - | None | Acceptable |

### Comparative Analysis

Comparison with December 1970 results shows minor increases in total dissolved solids and chloride content in both wells. These variations fall within normal seasonal fluctuation ranges and do not indicate any significant changes in aquifer conditions.

**Well G Changes (Dec 1970 to Feb 1971):**
- Total Dissolved Solids: 232 mg/L to 245 mg/L (+13 mg/L)
- Chloride: 24 mg/L to 28 mg/L (+4 mg/L)

**Well H Changes (Dec 1970 to Feb 1971):**
- Total Dissolved Solids: 251 mg/L to 268 mg/L (+17 mg/L)
- Chloride: 27 mg/L to 32 mg/L (+5 mg/L)

## OPERATIONAL STATUS

Both wells operated normally during the testing period. Well G pumped approximately 1,850 gallons per minute during active periods, while Well H maintained output of 1,920 gallons per minute. Combined output when both wells operate simultaneously provides approximately 5.4 million gallons per day capacity.

During February 1971, Wells G and H were in operation for 18 days of the month, providing supplemental water supply during peak demand periods. The wells were offline for routine maintenance on February 4-6 and February 20-22.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Continued Monitoring:** Maintain current monthly testing schedule for all standard parameters.

2. **Chloride Trend Monitoring:** Given the slight upward trend in chloride levels in both wells, recommend bi-weekly chloride testing for the next quarter to establish whether this represents normal seasonal variation or requires further investigation.

3. **Pump Efficiency Review:** Schedule routine pump efficiency testing for both wells during the April maintenance period to ensure optimal performance.

4. **Distribution System Flushing:** Recommend quarterly flushing of distribution lines serving East Woburn residential areas to maintain water quality throughout the delivery system.

5. **Record Keeping:** Continue maintaining detailed operational logs for both wells, including pumping hours, flow rates, and any observed anomalies.

## CONCLUSIONS

Water quality from Wells G and H continues to meet all applicable state and federal standards for municipal water supply. The minor increases in dissolved solids and chloride content observed in February 1971 fall within acceptable ranges and likely represent normal aquifer variations.

Both wells remain suitable for continued operation as supplemental water sources for the Woburn municipal system. No immediate corrective actions are required, though continued monitoring is recommended to track any developing trends.

The bacteriological quality of water from both wells remains excellent, with no detection of coliform bacteria or other harmful microorganisms. Physical characteristics including color, odor, and turbidity are well within acceptable limits.
