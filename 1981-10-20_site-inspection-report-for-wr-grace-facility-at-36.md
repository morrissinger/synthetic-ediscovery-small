**369 Washington Street, Woburn, Massachusetts**

**Prepared by:** Schlichtmann Conway & Crowley

**Time:** 10:00 AM - 3:30 PM  
**Weather Conditions:** Clear, 52°F, light wind from northwest

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents the findings of a comprehensive site inspection conducted at the W.R. Grace & Co. manufacturing facility located at 369 Washington Street in Woburn, Massachusetts. The inspection was undertaken as part of our investigation into potential sources of groundwater contamination affecting municipal Wells G and H, which have been linked to elevated cancer rates in the East Woburn community. Our investigation reveals significant evidence of improper chemical waste disposal practices that may constitute negligence and breach of the defendant's duty of care to the surrounding community.

## INSPECTION TEAM

**Lead Inspector:** Charles Nesson, Esq.  
**Environmental Consultant:** Dr. George Pinder, Princeton University  
**Hydrogeologist:** Dr. Jan van der Kamp  
**Photographer:** Kevin Conway  
**Legal Assistant:** Margaret Crowley

## FACILITY DESCRIPTION

The W.R. Grace facility at 369 Washington Street occupies approximately 52 acres in an industrial zone adjacent to residential neighborhoods. The facility has operated continuously since 1953, manufacturing chemical products including specialty chemicals, sealants, and industrial solvents. The property is bounded by the Aberjona River to the east, residential properties to the south and west, and additional industrial facilities to the north.

The facility contains multiple buildings including:
- Main manufacturing building (approximately 180,000 sq ft)
- Chemical storage warehouses (3 buildings)
- Administrative offices
- Maintenance shop
- Waste treatment building (constructed 1967)

## WASTE DISPOSAL AREAS IDENTIFIED

### Area A: Former Drum Storage Area

**Location:** Northeast corner of property, approximately 300 feet from Aberjona River

**Observations:** Visual inspection revealed a 2.5-acre area with disturbed soil, sparse vegetation, and visible staining. Soil samples collected show dark discoloration and chemical odor consistent with organic solvents. Multiple depressions in the ground suggest former burial of waste containers. Local residents report that drums were routinely buried in this area during the 1960s and early 1970s.

**Photographic Evidence:** Photos 001-015 document soil staining, vegetation damage, and surface depressions.

### Area B: Process Waste Lagoon

**Location:** Central portion of property, 150 yards southeast of main manufacturing building

**Observations:** An unlined lagoon approximately 100 feet by 200 feet, currently filled with dark liquid exhibiting an oily sheen. Strong chemical odor detected at 50-foot perimeter. No visible containment systems or monitoring wells present. Overflow channel leads toward storm drain system connecting to Aberjona River.

**Water Sample:** Sample B-001 collected from lagoon surface for laboratory analysis.

### Area C: Solvent Recovery Building Discharge Point

**Location:** West side of solvent recovery building, 75 feet from building foundation

**Observations:** Direct discharge pipe from building leads to uncovered concrete settling basin. Basin shows evidence of overflow during high-volume operations. Soil around basin heavily stained with dark, oily residue. Groundwater monitoring well MW-3 (installed 1979) located 25 feet downgradient shows consistent detection of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene.

## GROUNDWATER FLOW ANALYSIS

Based on topographic maps and our hydrogeological assessment, groundwater at the site flows in a generally southeasterly direction toward the Aberjona River at an estimated rate of 0.5 feet per day. This flow pattern places the identified waste disposal areas hydraulically upgradient from municipal Wells G and H, located approximately 1,800 feet southeast of the facility.

**Well G Distance:** 1,847 feet southeast of Area A  
**Well H Distance:** 1,923 feet southeast of Area A  
**Estimated Groundwater Travel Time:** 8-12 years from disposal areas to municipal wells

## CHEMICAL USAGE DOCUMENTATION

Review of available facility records and interviews with former employees indicate extensive use of:

- **Trichloroethylene (TCE):** Primary degreasing solvent, estimated 50,000-75,000 gallons annually
- **Tetrachloroethylene (PCE):** Secondary cleaning solvent, estimated 15,000-25,000 gallons annually  
- **1,1,1-Trichloroethane:** Parts cleaning, estimated 10,000 gallons annually
- **Methylene Chloride:** Paint stripping operations, estimated 5,000 gallons annually

Former employee testimony indicates that waste solvents were routinely disposed of by:
1. Burial in drums in Area A (1953-1974)
2. Direct discharge to Process Waste Lagoon (1953-present)
3. Discharge to storm drain system (1953-1967)

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### Federal Regulations

**Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA):** Facility operations predate RCRA implementation (1976), but current practices appear non-compliant with hazardous waste management requirements.

**Safe Drinking Water Act:** Municipal wells contamination levels exceed Maximum Contaminant Levels established in 1979.

### State Regulations

**Massachusetts Hazardous Waste Regulations (310 CMR 30.000):** Current disposal practices violate state hazardous waste management requirements implemented in 1980.

## EVIDENCE OF NEGLIGENCE

Based on our inspection findings, the following evidence supports claims of negligence and breach of duty of care:

### 1. Failure to Exercise Reasonable Care

The defendant's disposal practices demonstrate a clear failure to exercise the reasonable care expected of a chemical manufacturer:
- **Unlined disposal areas:** No containment systems to prevent groundwater contamination
- **Direct discharge practices:** Allowing untreated chemical waste to enter surface water and groundwater
- **Inadequate monitoring:** No groundwater monitoring until 1979, despite 26 years of operations

### 2. Breach of Industry Standards

Contemporary industry practices, even in the 1950s and 1960s, included basic containment measures that W.R. Grace failed to implement:
- **American Chemical Society guidelines (1955)** recommended lined disposal areas for organic solvents
- **Manufacturing Chemists' Association standards (1962)** called for groundwater monitoring near disposal sites
- **Company's own corporate environmental policies (1968)** required environmental impact assessments for new disposal methods

### 3. Knowledge of Harm

Evidence suggests the defendant knew or should have known of potential environmental and health impacts:
- **Internal memoranda (1967)** reference concerns about "waste disposal methods" and "potential groundwater issues"
- **Consultant report (1971)** recommended "immediate cessation of direct discharge practices"
- **Employee complaints (1965-1975)** documented health concerns related to chemical exposure

## CAUSATION ANALYSIS

The spatial and temporal relationship between the defendant's waste disposal practices and municipal well contamination establishes a clear causal pathway:

**Temporal Correlation:**
- Facility operations began: 1953
- Peak disposal activities: 1960-1974
- Wells G and H opened: 1964 and 1966
- First contamination detected: 1979
- Groundwater travel time consistent with contamination timeline

**Spatial Correlation:**
- Waste disposal areas located hydraulically upgradient from municipal wells
- Groundwater flow direction confirmed by multiple studies
- Contaminant plume modeling consistent with facility as source

**Chemical Fingerprinting:**
- TCE and PCE detected in wells match chemicals used at facility
- Concentration ratios consistent with facility waste streams
- No other significant sources identified in groundwater flow path

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Cease all direct discharge to unlined disposal areas
   - Install groundwater monitoring wells downgradient from all waste areas
   - Conduct comprehensive soil and groundwater sampling

2. **Remedial Measures:**
   - Excavate and properly dispose of contaminated soil in Areas A and C
   - Install
