### AGENDA ITEM 1: QUARTERLY CHEMICAL PROCUREMENT REVIEW

Mr. Riley opened the meeting by reviewing the third quarter expenditures for tanning chemicals and solvents. Mr. McCarthy presented the financial summary indicating a 23% increase in chemical costs compared to the same period in 1937.

**Key Financial Points Discussed:**
- Total chemical procurement costs for July-September 1938: $2,847.50
- Primary expense categories: chromium compounds ($987.25), sulfuric acid ($654.80), sodium chloride ($445.60), tanning extracts ($759.85)
- Solvent purchases including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene: $312.40

Mr. Sullivan reported that the increased chemical usage reflects expanded production capacity following the installation of additional vats in the main processing building during June 1938. The plant is now operating at 85% capacity, processing approximately 2,200 hides per month.

**DECISION:** Approved continuation of current chemical supplier relationships with Merrimack Chemical Supply Company of Lawrence, Massachusetts, and Boston Industrial Solvents Company.

### AGENDA ITEM 2: WASTE DISPOSAL COST ANALYSIS

Mr. McCarthy presented analysis of waste disposal expenses, noting significant cost savings achieved through on-site disposal methods implemented over the past eighteen months.

**Current Disposal Practices:**
- Solid waste materials: Burial in designated areas on company property west of main building
- Chemical waste solutions: Discharge to settling ponds constructed in 1937 on southwestern portion of property
- Spent solvents: Disposal in excavated area near railroad tracks, covered with lime and soil

Mr. Sullivan reported that the settling pond system has proven effective in managing liquid wastes from the tanning process. The three-pond configuration allows for sequential treatment, with final discharge occurring through natural seepage into surrounding soil.

**Cost Comparison:**
- Previous off-site disposal costs (1936): $156.00 per month
- Current on-site disposal costs: $34.50 per month (materials and labor only)
- Annual savings projected: $1,458.00

**DECISION:** Continue current waste disposal practices. Mr. Sullivan to monitor pond capacity and recommend expansion if necessary by December 1938.

### AGENDA ITEM 3: PROCUREMENT EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS

Discussion focused on optimizing chemical purchasing to reduce costs while maintaining production quality.

Mr. Riley proposed establishing bulk purchasing agreements with primary suppliers to secure volume discounts. Mr. McCarthy presented calculations showing potential savings of 8-12% on major chemical categories through quarterly bulk orders.

**Specific Recommendations:**
- Chromium sulfate: Increase order quantities to 50-drum minimum for 10% discount
- Trichloroethylene: Establish standing order for monthly delivery of 200-gallon quantities
- Sulfuric acid: Negotiate annual contract with guaranteed pricing

Mr. Sullivan expressed concern about storage capacity for increased chemical inventory. Current storage building can accommodate approximately 60% increase in chemical stocks with minor reorganization.

**DECISION:** Mr. McCarthy authorized to negotiate bulk purchasing agreements with primary suppliers. Target implementation by November 1, 1938.

### AGENDA ITEM 4: REGULATORY COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

Brief discussion of recent correspondence from Massachusetts Department of Public Health regarding industrial waste management practices.

Mr. Riley noted that the company received informational materials about proposed guidelines for industrial waste disposal but emphasized that current regulations do not mandate changes to existing practices. The tannery's operations remain fully compliant with all applicable state and local requirements.

**Current Compliance Status:**
- Business license: Valid through December 31, 1939
- Fire safety inspection: Completed August 15, 1938, no violations
- Local health department: No outstanding issues or requirements

**DECISION:** Continue monitoring regulatory developments. No immediate action required.

### ACTION ITEMS

1. **Mr. McCarthy:** Initiate negotiations with chemical suppliers for bulk purchasing agreements by September 20, 1938
2. **Mr. Sullivan:** Prepare storage capacity assessment and reorganization plan by September 25, 1938
3. **Mr. Sullivan:** Monitor settling pond capacity and submit expansion recommendations by December 1, 1938
4. **Ms. O'Brien:** File copies of all supplier agreements and maintain procurement records for quarterly review

### NEXT MEETING

Scheduled for December 15, 1938, at 10:30 AM to review fourth quarter results and plan for 1939 operations.
