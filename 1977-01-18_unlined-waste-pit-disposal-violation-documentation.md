## INSPECTION FINDINGS

### Primary Violation: Unlined Waste Disposal Pit

During the course of this unannounced inspection, conducted pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21, Section 27, this inspector documented the existence of an **unlined waste disposal pit** located approximately 200 feet southeast of the main processing facility. The pit, measuring approximately 30 feet in length, 20 feet in width, and 8 feet in depth, contains visible liquid waste materials and exhibits clear evidence of prolonged use for the disposal of industrial process waste.

**Specific Observations:**

1. **Pit Construction:** The disposal pit lacks any form of synthetic or clay liner, allowing direct contact between waste materials and native soil. Soil samples collected at the pit perimeter show visible staining and chemical odors consistent with organic solvent contamination.

2. **Waste Characteristics:** Visual inspection and field testing indicate the presence of:
   - Trichloroethylene (TCE) - confirmed by field test kit
   - Perchloroethylene (PCE) - suspected based on odor characteristics
   - Various food processing solvents and cleaning agents
   - Oily substances with petroleum-based characteristics

3. **Groundwater Proximity:** Site survey indicates the pit bottom extends to within approximately 12 feet of the estimated seasonal high groundwater table. Given the permeable nature of the glacial outwash soils characteristic of this area, direct groundwater contamination is virtually certain.

4. **Documentation Deficiency:** Facility records provided by Mr. Henderson show no documentation of waste disposal activities, waste characterization, or any environmental monitoring related to this disposal site.

### Secondary Violations

**Improper Chemical Storage:** Multiple containers of cleaning solvents and degreasers observed stored without secondary containment in the maintenance building. Several containers showed evidence of minor leakage onto concrete flooring with visible staining extending toward floor drains.

**Inadequate Record Keeping:** Facility failed to maintain required waste disposal logs as mandated under current permit conditions. Mr. Henderson acknowledged that disposal activities have been "informal" and not systematically documented.

## ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

The documented violations present **immediate and substantial risk** to public health and environmental resources. The unlined waste pit represents a direct pathway for hazardous chemical migration into the underlying groundwater system, which serves as the source for municipal water supply wells located within the probable zone of hydrogeological influence.

**Specific Concerns:**

- **Groundwater Contamination:** The permeable soil conditions and shallow groundwater depth create optimal conditions for rapid contaminant migration. Municipal Wells G and H, located approximately 1,200 and 1,500 feet downgradient respectively, may be at risk for contamination.

- **Soil Contamination:** Extended use of the unlined pit has resulted in significant soil contamination extending beyond the pit boundaries. Preliminary field observations suggest contamination may extend to depths of 10-15 feet.

- **Public Health Risk:** The documented presence of chlorinated solvents, particularly TCE and suspected PCE, represents a significant public health concern given their classification as probable human carcinogens and their persistence in groundwater systems.

## REGULATORY VIOLATIONS

### Primary Violation: MGL Chapter 21, Section 27
**Improper Hazardous Waste Disposal**

The operation of an unlined waste disposal pit for the disposal of hazardous industrial waste constitutes a direct violation of Massachusetts environmental protection statutes. The facility's disposal practices demonstrate:

- **Negligent Disregard** for established environmental protection standards
- **Breach of Duty** to operate in accordance with permit conditions and applicable regulations
- **Failure to Exercise Reasonable Care** in the handling and disposal of hazardous materials

### Secondary Violations: 310 CMR 19.000
**Hazardous Waste Management Requirements**

1. **Failure to Characterize Waste:** No documentation of waste analysis or characterization
2. **Improper Storage:** Lack of secondary containment for hazardous materials
3. **Inadequate Record Keeping:** Failure to maintain required disposal documentation
4. **Permit Violations:** Operation outside the scope of approved activities

---

## IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS REQUIRED

**WITHIN 48 HOURS:**

1. **Cease All Disposal Activities:** Immediate discontinuation of waste disposal in the unlined pit
2. **Site Security:** Installation of fencing and warning signs around the contaminated area
3. **Spill Prevention:** Implementation of secondary containment for all stored chemicals

**WITHIN 30 DAYS:**

1. **Professional Site Assessment:** Retention of qualified environmental consultant to conduct comprehensive site characterization including:
   - Soil sampling at minimum 25-foot intervals to 15-foot depth
   - Groundwater monitoring well installation and sampling
   - Waste characterization of pit contents

2. **Remediation Plan:** Development of comprehensive remediation plan including:
   - Waste removal and proper disposal procedures
   - Contaminated soil excavation protocols
   - Groundwater remediation methodology where required

3. **Regulatory Compliance:** Full compliance with hazardous waste management regulations including proper manifesting, storage, and disposal procedures

## ENFORCEMENT ACTION

Based on the severity of documented violations and the immediate threat to public health and environmental resources, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection hereby initiates formal enforcement proceedings against Beatrice Foods Company. 

**Administrative Order:** A formal Administrative Order will be issued within ten (10) business days requiring immediate compliance with corrective actions outlined above and establishing a schedule for comprehensive site remediation.

**Civil Penalties:** The facility is subject to civil penalties under MGL Chapter 21, Section 42A, with fines of up to $25,000 per day for each violation. Initial penalty assessment will be calculated based on violation severity, duration, and environmental impact.

**Criminal Referral:** Due to the willful nature of the violations and the substantial environmental threat posed, this matter is being referred to the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office for consideration of criminal prosecution under applicable environmental protection statutes.
