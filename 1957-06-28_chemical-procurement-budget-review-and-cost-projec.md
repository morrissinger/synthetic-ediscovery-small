# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** John J. Riley, President  
**FROM:** Financial Analysis Department  
**DATE:** June 28, 1957  
**RE:** Chemical Procurement Budget Review and Cost Projections - Fiscal Year 1958

## Executive Summary

This memorandum presents our comprehensive analysis of chemical procurement costs for the Riley Tannery operations at 228 Salem Street for the upcoming fiscal year. Based on current production volumes and anticipated market conditions, we project total chemical procurement expenses of $47,850 for FY 1958, representing a 12% increase over the current year's expenditures of $42,725.

## Current Chemical Inventory and Usage Patterns

Our analysis of the past eighteen months reveals consistent usage patterns across our primary chemical categories. **Tanning agents** continue to represent our largest expense category, with chromium sulfate purchases averaging 2,400 pounds monthly at $0.32 per pound. The recent price stabilization in the chromium market has provided welcome relief from the volatility experienced in 1955-1956, though we anticipate modest increases of 3-4% annually.

**Solvent requirements** have increased substantially due to expanded degreasing operations in Building C. Our monthly consumption of trichloroethylene has risen to 850 gallons, purchased at $0.28 per gallon from Consolidated Chemical Supply of Boston. Tetrachloroethylene usage has similarly increased to 650 gallons monthly at $0.31 per gallon. These solvents have proven essential for achieving the quality standards demanded by our automotive and furniture industry customers, particularly for the premium leather grades that command our highest margins.

**Acids and alkalis** represent our third major expense category, with sulfuric acid consumption averaging 1,200 gallons monthly and sodium hydroxide requirements at 800 pounds monthly. The recent construction of improved storage facilities has allowed us to take advantage of bulk purchasing discounts, reducing per-unit costs by approximately 8% compared to smaller quantity purchases.

## Projected Requirements and Cost Analysis

For FY 1958, we anticipate a 15% increase in overall production volume based on confirmed contracts with Middlesex Leather Goods and New England Automotive Trim. This expansion necessitates proportional increases in chemical procurement across all categories.

**Tanning Chemicals:** We project annual requirements of 31,200 pounds of chromium sulfate at an estimated cost of $10,608, assuming current pricing remains stable. Additional tanning agents including aluminum sulfate and vegetable extracts will require an estimated $3,200 annually.

**Industrial Solvents:** Expanded degreasing operations will require approximately 11,400 gallons of trichloroethylene annually at a projected cost of $3,420. Tetrachloroethylene requirements of 8,600 gallons will cost an estimated $2,838. We recommend maintaining a 60-day inventory of these critical solvents to protect against supply disruptions.

**Processing Chemicals:** Sulfuric acid requirements of 15,600 gallons will cost approximately $2,184, while sodium hydroxide needs of 10,400 pounds are projected at $1,248. Various specialty chemicals including dyes, oils, and finishing compounds will require an additional $4,800 annually.

## Waste Disposal Considerations

Current disposal practices for spent chemicals and process residues continue through our established arrangements with the municipal system and approved industrial waste contractors. The recent expansion of our settling pond capacity has improved our ability to handle increased volumes of process wastewater, though we recommend monitoring developments in state environmental regulations that may affect future disposal requirements.

Spent solvent disposal costs have increased to $0.08 per gallon due to new handling requirements implemented by our waste contractor, Suburban Disposal Services. This represents an annual expense of approximately $1,600 for solvent waste disposal, which has been incorporated into our overall cost projections.

## Supplier Analysis and Recommendations

**Consolidated Chemical Supply** remains our primary vendor for industrial solvents, offering competitive pricing and reliable delivery schedules. Their recent expansion of warehouse facilities in Medford should improve service to our East Woburn location.

**Massachusetts Chemical Corporation** continues to provide excellent service for our acid and alkali requirements, with their bulk delivery capabilities proving particularly valuable for our increased production volumes.

**New England Tanning Supply** has proposed a comprehensive supply agreement for all tanning chemicals that would provide a 6% discount on current pricing in exchange for a twelve-month commitment. This arrangement would generate annual savings of approximately $840 while ensuring supply security for our expanded operations.

## Budget Recommendations

We recommend approval of the $47,850 chemical procurement budget for FY 1958, with quarterly reviews to monitor actual consumption against projections. The proposed budget includes a 5% contingency reserve of $2,279 to address potential price increases or unexpected supply requirements.

Priority should be given to securing the proposed supply agreement with New England Tanning Supply, as the guaranteed pricing protection would provide significant budget stability in an increasingly volatile chemical market. Additionally, we recommend expanding our bulk storage capacity for trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene to take advantage of volume pricing discounts that could reduce per-gallon costs by $0.03-$0.04.

The financial position of the Riley Company remains strong enough to support these increased chemical procurement requirements while maintaining adequate working capital reserves. The projected increase in chemical costs represents a sound investment in maintaining our competitive position in the premium leather market.
