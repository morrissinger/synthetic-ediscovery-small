# WORK ORDER - MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT

**W.R. GRACE COMPANY**  
**WOBURN MANUFACTURING FACILITY**  
**62 Montvale Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801**

---

**WORK ORDER NO:** MWO-77-0330-004  
**DATE:** March 30, 1977  
**TIME:** 3:30 PM  
**PRIORITY:** ROUTINE  
**DEPARTMENT:** Plant Maintenance  

**FROM:** Robert F. Mitchell, Maintenance Supervisor  
**TO:** Plant Maintenance Crew - Second Shift  
**SUBJECT:** Disposal of Contaminated Materials - Building 7 Chemical Storage Area

---

## WORK DESCRIPTION

The maintenance crew is directed to complete the following disposal activities during the evening shift of March 30, 1977:

### Primary Task - Chemical Waste Removal

Remove all contaminated materials from Building 7 chemical storage area, including but not limited to:

- **Seventeen (17) steel drums** containing various chemical residues and solvents used in manufacturing operations
- **Multiple cardboard containers** with absorbed chemical materials and contaminated rags
- **Miscellaneous equipment** including pumps, hoses, and mixing apparatus showing chemical staining
- **Floor sweepings** and debris from recent spill cleanup activities

### Disposal Instructions

All materials are to be transported to the **rear disposal area** located beyond the facility's eastern perimeter fence. Materials should be deposited in the designated low-lying area approximately 200 yards southeast of Building 12, adjacent to the natural drainage channel that runs toward the Aberjona River system.

**Note:** Some drums may contain residual amounts of trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (perc), and other industrial solvents used in our Cryovac manufacturing processes. Exercise normal industrial handling precautions during transport.

### Equipment Requirements

- **Two (2) flatbed trucks** for drum transport
- **Standard loading equipment** (dollies, ramps, chains)
- **Basic protective equipment** (work gloves, coveralls)
- **Shovels and rakes** for spreading loose materials

### Timeline and Staffing

This work is scheduled for completion during the **evening shift (4:00 PM - 12:00 AM)** to minimize disruption to normal manufacturing operations. Assign a **minimum of four (4) crew members** to ensure efficient completion.

**Crew assignments should include:**
- Two experienced operators for truck loading and transport
- One crew member for area cleanup and final inspection
- One crew member for equipment return and documentation

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Access and Security

The eastern perimeter gate will remain unlocked during disposal operations. Ensure gate is properly secured upon completion of work. The disposal area is not visible from public roadways, which allows for efficient operations without external interference.

### Weather Conditions

Current weather forecast indicates partly cloudy conditions with temperatures in the mid-40s. Ground conditions in the disposal area are reported as firm, suitable for truck access. Recent rainfall has created favorable conditions for material absorption into the soil.

### Documentation Requirements

**Minimal documentation required** for this routine disposal activity. Crew supervisor should note completion time and any equipment issues in the standard maintenance log. No special reporting to regulatory agencies is necessary for these materials, as they fall within normal industrial waste parameters.

### Safety Protocols

Standard industrial safety protocols apply. While these materials contain various chemical compounds, they pose no unusual hazards when handled using normal industrial practices. The disposal area's natural drainage and soil conditions provide adequate containment for the materials being deposited.

**Important:** Ensure all materials are distributed evenly across the disposal area to promote natural decomposition and prevent accumulation of materials in any single location.

## COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS

### Final Steps

Upon completion of disposal activities, crew members should:

1. **Return all equipment** to designated storage areas
2. **Conduct final inspection** of Building 7 storage area to ensure complete removal
3. **Secure disposal area** and eastern perimeter gate
4. **Report completion** to shift supervisor

### Follow-up Actions

No immediate follow-up actions are required. The disposal area will be monitored through normal facility security rounds. Natural weather conditions and soil absorption will handle the integration of these materials into the local environment over time.

This disposal method represents the most cost-effective approach for handling these routine manufacturing waste products while maintaining our facility's operational efficiency.
