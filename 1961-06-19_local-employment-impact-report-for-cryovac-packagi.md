## FACILITY OPERATIONS AND EXPANSION PLANS

### Current Production Capacity

Our Woburn facility operates at approximately 85% capacity, producing packaging machinery for food processing companies throughout New England and the Mid-Atlantic region. The facility encompasses 127,000 square feet of manufacturing space, with additional administrative offices and research laboratories.

### Planned Expansion

Based on projected demand for our packaging technologies, Cryovac anticipates expanding operations during fiscal year 1962. Preliminary plans include construction of an additional 35,000 square feet of manufacturing space and the installation of new precision machining equipment.

This expansion would create approximately 75-90 additional manufacturing positions and 15-20 technical and administrative roles. We estimate that 80% of these new positions would be filled through local hiring, consistent with our community employment practices.

## WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES

### Training Programs

Cryovac has invested significantly in employee training and development programs designed to enhance both individual career advancement and overall operational efficiency. Our comprehensive training initiatives include:

**Technical Skills Development:** 40-hour certification programs for machine operators and quality control personnel  
**Safety Training:** Monthly safety meetings and annual certification requirements for all manufacturing staff  
**Leadership Development:** Supervisory training program for high-potential employees  
**Continuing Education Support:** Tuition reimbursement for job-related coursework at local technical colleges

### Safety and Working Conditions

Our facility maintains exemplary safety standards, with only three reportable workplace incidents during the past fiscal year—well below industry averages. We have implemented comprehensive safety protocols for all manufacturing operations, including proper ventilation systems, protective equipment requirements, and regular safety inspections.

**Lost Time Accidents:** 3 incidents (0.86 per 100 employees)  
**Safety Training Hours:** 2,847 total hours  
**Workers' Compensation Claims:** 2 minor claims totaling $340

## COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK

### Local Government Cooperation

Cryovac maintains excellent relationships with Woburn city officials and has worked cooperatively on various municipal initiatives, including industrial zoning improvements and infrastructure development projects. Our facility complies with all local regulations and building codes.

### Long-term Commitment

As a subsidiary of W.R. Grace Company, Cryovac is positioned for continued growth and expansion in the Woburn market. Our commitment to the local community extends beyond immediate employment considerations to encompass long-term economic partnership and mutual prosperity.

The packaging machinery industry continues to experience robust growth, driven by increasing demand for food preservation technologies and expanding consumer markets. Cryovac's innovative products and manufacturing capabilities position us to capitalize on these market opportunities while maintaining our role as a significant local employer.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on this analysis, I recommend that W.R. Grace Corporate Office approve the proposed facility expansion and authorize increased local hiring initiatives. The Woburn operation has demonstrated consistent profitability, strong community integration, and excellent growth potential.

Furthermore, I suggest expanding our partnership with local educational institutions to develop specialized training programs aligned with our technical requirements. This initiative would strengthen our recruitment pipeline while contributing to regional workforce development.
