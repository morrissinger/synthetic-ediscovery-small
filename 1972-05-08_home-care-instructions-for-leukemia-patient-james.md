## HOME CARE INSTRUCTIONS

### DIAGNOSIS
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), diagnosed April 3, 1972

### CURRENT TREATMENT PROTOCOL
Patient is currently receiving combination chemotherapy including:
- Vincristine (Oncovin) - weekly intravenous administration
- Prednisone - daily oral administration per dosing schedule
- Methotrexate - intrathecal administration as scheduled

### DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS

**Prednisone 5mg tablets**
- Dosage: 40mg daily (8 tablets) taken with food in morning
- Duration: Continue until next appointment unless otherwise instructed
- **Important:** Do not stop suddenly - must be tapered gradually

**Allopurinol 100mg tablets**
- Dosage: 1 tablet twice daily
- Purpose: Prevent uric acid buildup from cell destruction
- Take with plenty of fluids

**Multivitamin supplement**
- One tablet daily with breakfast

### INFECTION PREVENTION - CRITICAL

James's white blood cell count is severely compromised. **Strict precautions must be observed:**

1. **Isolation from sick contacts** - Keep James away from anyone with cold, fever, or illness
2. **Hand washing** - All family members must wash hands frequently with soap and warm water
3. **Avoid crowds** - No shopping centers, movie theaters, or large gatherings
4. **School restriction** - James is not to attend school until cleared by medical team
5. **Temperature monitoring** - Take rectal temperature twice daily and record

### IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION REQUIRED FOR:
- **Fever above 101°F (38.3°C)**
- Persistent vomiting or inability to keep medications down
- Signs of infection: unusual fatigue, chills, sore throat
- Unusual bleeding or bruising
- Severe headache or neck stiffness
- Difficulty breathing or chest pain
- Any sign of distress or significant change in condition

### NUTRITION AND HYDRATION

- Encourage high-calorie, high-protein foods when appetite permits
- Offer small, frequent meals rather than large portions
- Maintain adequate fluid intake - at least 6-8 glasses of water daily
- Avoid raw fruits and vegetables, unpasteurized dairy products
- All meat must be thoroughly cooked

### ACTIVITY RESTRICTIONS

- **No contact sports or rough play** - risk of injury and bleeding
- Gentle indoor activities are acceptable if James feels well
- **Avoid public swimming pools** - infection risk too high
- Short walks in fresh air are beneficial when weather permits

### MEDICATION SCHEDULE COMPLIANCE

**Critical importance:** Missing doses or stopping medications can result in disease progression. If James vomits within 30 minutes of oral medication, contact hospital immediately for guidance.

### SIDE EFFECTS TO MONITOR

**Expected side effects may include:**
- Nausea and loss of appetite
- Increased susceptibility to infection
- Easy bruising or bleeding
- Fatigue and weakness
- Mood changes from prednisone
- Hair thinning or loss

**Report immediately if severe or worsening**

### FOLLOW-UP CARE

- Blood work will be drawn
- Physical examination
- Treatment plan review

**Weekly blood counts** required - laboratory slips provided

### EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION

**Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Service:** 617-735-6385  
**After hours/weekends:** Ask for Pediatric Oncology resident on call

### SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MRS. ANDERSON

Given the serious nature of James's condition and the intensive treatment required, I want to emphasize several critical points:

1. **Pain management:** James may experience bone pain, headaches, or discomfort from treatments. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be given as directed - **never aspirin** due to bleeding risk.

2. **Emotional support:** This is an extremely difficult time for your family. James may experience mood changes, fear, and discomfort. Maintaining as normal a routine as possible while following medical restrictions will help him cope.

3. **Treatment compliance:** The chemotherapy protocol we are using represents the most current and effective treatment available for childhood leukemia. Strict adherence to the schedule and precautions is essential for the best possible outcome.

4. **Communication:** Please do not hesitate to call with any questions or concerns, no matter how minor they may seem. Early intervention for complications can prevent serious problems.

### PROGNOSIS DISCUSSION

As we discussed, James's condition is serious, and treatment will be intensive over the coming months. We are cautiously optimistic about his response to therapy thus far. The next several months will be critical in determining his long-term prognosis. We will continue to monitor his progress closely and adjust treatment as needed.

### PATIENT/FAMILY EDUCATION ACKNOWLEDGMENT
