# Letter from Margaret Riley to Thomas Riley

May 17, 1945

Dear Thomas,

I hope this letter finds you and Eleanor well, and that your service overseas has not been too difficult these past months. We have all been praying for your safe return, and Father speaks of you often when we gather for Sunday dinner. The war news seems more hopeful each day, and we are counting the weeks until you can come home to Massachusetts.

I am writing to you about some concerns regarding the tannery operation that Father has been discussing with Mother and me. As you know, the business has continued to operate throughout the war years, though we have faced considerable challenges with materials shortages and labor difficulties. Many of our regular workers have been called to service or have taken positions in the defense plants, leaving Father to manage much of the daily operations himself despite his advancing age. He turned sixty-eight last month, and I can see that the physical demands of running the tannery are becoming more burdensome for him.

The primary concern that prompted me to write involves some observations Father has made about the waste materials from our leather processing operations. You will recall that since 1909, when Grandfather John established the tannery on Salem Street, we have followed the standard practices for disposing of the chemical solutions used in hide treatment and leather finishing. The chromium compounds, acids, and various solvents have always been discharged into the settling ponds Father constructed behind the main building, with the understanding that this represented accepted industrial practice throughout the region. However, Father has recently noticed some changes in the groundwater conditions near our property that have given him cause for concern.

Last month, when Father was inspecting the area around the disposal ponds, he observed that the soil in several locations has taken on an unusual discoloration—a greenish tinge that was not present in previous years. More troubling, he discovered that one of the shallow wells on the neighboring property, which the Kowalski family has used for their vegetable garden, now produces water with a distinctly metallic taste and a slight chemical odor. Mrs. Kowalski mentioned this to Mother when they met at church, expressing worry about whether the water remains safe for irrigating their tomatoes and beans. Father has been reluctant to discuss this matter directly with the Kowalskis, as he is uncertain about the connection between our operations and the changes they have observed.

Additionally, Father has been corresponding with other tannery operators in the Massachusetts Leather Association, and several have reported similar observations at their facilities. Henry Brennan, who operates the tannery in Peabody, mentioned that the state health department has begun asking questions about industrial waste disposal practices, though no formal regulations have yet been established. There appears to be growing awareness among government officials that the traditional methods of handling manufacturing waste may require modification, particularly as residential development continues to expand into areas that were previously considered purely industrial.

Father is particularly concerned about the long-term implications for our family business. The Riley tannery has operated continuously for thirty-six years, providing employment for dozens of local families and contributing to the economic vitality of East Woburn. The techniques we employ for leather processing represent generations of accumulated knowledge and experience, and any significant changes to our operations would require substantial investment in new equipment and procedures. Father worries that if new regulations are imposed on industrial waste disposal, smaller family-owned operations like ours may find it difficult to comply while remaining economically viable.

At the same time, Father recognizes that we have a responsibility to our neighbors and to the broader community. The Aberjona River, which flows along the eastern edge of our property, eventually supplies water to communities downstream, and Father has always taken pride in being a responsible member of the East Woburn business community. He has spoken with Mother about the possibility of consulting with an engineering firm to evaluate our current disposal methods and to explore alternatives that might address any environmental concerns while preserving the viability of our operations.

I wanted to share these developments with you because Father values your judgment and because you will ultimately inherit responsibility for the tannery's future direction. Your engineering education and your experience with industrial processes during your military service may provide valuable perspective on these challenges. Father hopes that when you return from overseas, you might be willing to spend time at the facility, reviewing our current operations and helping to develop a plan for addressing any necessary modifications.

Mother has suggested that we might also benefit from consulting with other family members who have experience in manufacturing operations. Cousin Robert, who manages the textile mill in Lawrence, has mentioned that his facility has implemented some changes to their dye waste disposal procedures following inquiries from state officials. He might be able to provide guidance on working with regulatory authorities while maintaining business operations.

The immediate question facing us is whether to make any changes to our current practices before your return, or to continue with our established procedures while gathering more information about potential requirements. Father is inclined toward caution, preferring to avoid any modifications that might disrupt production unnecessarily. However, he is also concerned about the possibility that delay might lead to more serious problems if the changes we have observed represent the beginning of more significant environmental impacts.

I should mention that the financial position of the tannery remains stable, despite the wartime challenges. We have maintained our contracts with several leather goods manufacturers who supply military equipment, and these relationships have provided steady revenue throughout the conflict. Father has been careful to set aside funds for equipment maintenance and facility improvements, recognizing that the post-war period may bring both opportunities and challenges for small manufacturing businesses.

Please write when you have an opportunity to consider these matters. Father would welcome your thoughts on how we should proceed, and Mother joins me in sending our love and prayers for your continued safety. We look forward to having you home again and to working together on securing the future of our family's business.

Your loving sister,

Margaret

P.S. - Mrs. Anderson from Maple Street stopped by last week to ask whether we might have any employment opportunities for her husband when he returns from the Pacific. I told her that Father would certainly consider any qualified applicants, as we will need to rebuild our workforce once the war ends. The Anderson family has always been good neighbors, and I know Father would be pleased to help them if possible.
