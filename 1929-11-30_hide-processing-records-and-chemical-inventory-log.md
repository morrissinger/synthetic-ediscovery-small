## PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Vat Maintenance:** Schedule comprehensive inspection and resealing of all eight vats during December shutdown period.

2. **Chemical Handling:** Implement improved drum handling procedures to reduce spillage incidents.

3. **Inventory Management:** Increase TCE and PCE inventory to 15 drums each to ensure adequate supply during peak production periods.

4. **Waste Management:** Consider expansion of settling pond capacity to accommodate increased production volumes planned for 1930.
