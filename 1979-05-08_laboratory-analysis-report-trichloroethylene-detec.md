## QUALITY ASSURANCE

**Duplicate Sample Analysis:**
- Primary sample TCE: 267 ppb
- Duplicate sample TCE: 271 ppb
- Relative Percent Difference: 1.5% (Acceptable: <20%)

**Blank Analysis:** No target compounds detected above method detection limits in laboratory blank or field blank samples.

**Calibration Verification:** All calibration standards within ±10% of expected values. Continuing calibration verification performed every 12 hours during analysis period.

## DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

The analysis of Well G water sample reveals significant contamination with trichloroethylene at a concentration of 267 parts per billion, which exceeds the EPA maximum contaminant level of 50 ppb by more than five times. This level of contamination poses potential health risks to consumers and requires immediate attention.

Trichloroethylene is a chlorinated solvent commonly used in industrial degreasing operations, metal cleaning, and manufacturing processes. The presence of this compound in groundwater typically indicates contamination from industrial sources, as TCE is not naturally occurring and has limited domestic or municipal uses.

The detection of multiple chlorinated solvents (TCE, PCE, 1,1,1-TCA) suggests a pattern consistent with industrial solvent contamination rather than isolated incidents. The concentration levels and compound profile indicate potential ongoing or historical discharge of industrial waste materials into the groundwater system serving Well G.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Action Required:** Well G should be removed from service immediately until contamination source is identified and remediated.

2. **Source Investigation:** Conduct comprehensive survey of potential contamination sources within the Well G capture zone, with particular attention to industrial facilities using chlorinated solvents.

3. **Additional Sampling:** Implement expanded sampling program to include:
   - Monthly monitoring of Wells G and H
   - Sampling of private wells in affected area
   - Background sampling of upgradient wells

4. **Public Health Notification:** Coordinate with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regarding potential health implications and public notification requirements.

5. **Alternative Water Supply:** Activate contingency water supply plans to maintain service to affected areas.
