## SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

Samples were collected following Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering guidelines for volatile organic compound analysis. Wells were purged for minimum 15 minutes prior to sample collection to ensure representative groundwater samples. Sample containers (40ml amber glass vials with Teflon-lined septa) were provided by Municipal Laboratory and maintained at 4°C during transport.

**Sample Preservation:** Hydrochloric acid to pH <2  
**Chain of Custody:** Maintained per standard protocol  
**Transport Time:** 2 hours 45 minutes to laboratory

## FIELD OBSERVATIONS

### Well G Observations
- **Pump Operation:** Normal, 350 GPM flow rate
- **Water Appearance:** Clear, no visible discoloration
- **Odor:** Slight chemical odor noted during pumping
- **Temperature:** 54°F
- **pH (field measurement):** 6.8
- **Conductivity:** 485 μS/cm

### Well H Observations
- **Pump Operation:** Normal, 425 GPM flow rate
- **Water Appearance:** Clear, no visible discoloration
- **Odor:** Distinct chemical odor, stronger than Well G
- **Temperature:** 53°F
- **pH (field measurement):** 6.9
- **Conductivity:** 520 μS/cm

---

## QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES

1. **Equipment Decontamination:** All sampling equipment cleaned with methanol and deionized water between wells
2. **Field Blanks:** One field blank collected using laboratory-supplied deionized water
3. **Duplicate Samples:** Duplicate samples collected from each well for precision assessment
4. **Chain of Custody:** Proper documentation maintained throughout collection and transport

---

## ANALYTICAL REQUEST

Samples submitted for analysis of the following volatile organic compounds using EPA Method 502.1:

- Trichloroethylene (TCE)
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) 
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane
- Carbon Tetrachloride
- Chloroform
- Methylene Chloride
- Benzene
- Toluene
- Xylenes (total)
- Vinyl Chloride

**Detection Limit Required:** 0.5 μg/L for all compounds  
**Turnaround Time Requested:** 7 working days

---

## SITE CONDITIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

The sampling area around both wells showed no obvious signs of contamination or unusual conditions. Well G is located approximately 1,200 feet southeast of the W.R. Grace/Cryovac facility on Washington Street. Well H is positioned approximately 800 feet east of the same facility. Both wells draw from the same aquifer system within the Aberjona River Valley.

Recent rainfall (0.3 inches on April 30) may have affected groundwater flow patterns. Wind direction during sampling was from the southwest, which could influence any surface volatile emissions in the area.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Analysis:** Priority processing recommended due to observed chemical odors
2. **Follow-up Sampling:** Recommend monthly VOC monitoring if initial results show contamination
3. **Expanded Testing:** Consider analysis for additional industrial solvents if primary screen shows positive results
4. **Well Inspection:** Schedule routine mechanical inspection of both wells within 30 days

---

## CERTIFICATION

I certify that the above water samples were collected in accordance with standard operating procedures and Massachusetts DEQ guidelines. All sampling equipment was properly decontaminated, and chain of custody protocols were strictly followed.
