# ZONA FAMILY RESIDENTIAL HISTORY AND EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT

**MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH**  
**DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT**

**TO:** DPH Epidemiology Division  
**FROM:** Environmental Health Investigator, Field Assessment Unit  
**DATE:** July 29, 1980  
**RE:** Zona Family Exposure Assessment - East Woburn Water Contamination Investigation  
**CASE FILE:** EW-1980-047  

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents findings from a comprehensive residential history and exposure assessment conducted for the Zona family of East Woburn, Massachusetts, as part of the ongoing investigation into childhood leukemia cases potentially linked to municipal water supply contamination from Wells G and H. The assessment documents a clear temporal relationship between the family's residence in the affected service area and their utilization of contaminated municipal water during the critical exposure period from 1964 to 1979.

## FAMILY DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

**Primary Subject:** Michael Zona (Deceased)  
**Date of Birth:** March 15, 1966  
**Date of Diagnosis:** Acute lymphocytic leukemia, September 1972  
**Date of Death:** January 8, 1973  
**Age at Diagnosis:** 6 years, 6 months  
**Age at Death:** 6 years, 10 months  

**Parents:** Anthony and Mary Zona  
**Residential Address:** 47 Maple Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts  
**Water Service Connection:** Municipal supply via Wells G and H distribution system  

## RESIDENTIAL HISTORY AND WATER EXPOSURE TIMELINE

### Pre-1964 Period
The Zona family established residence at 47 Maple Street in East Woburn in September 1962. Prior to May 1964, the household received municipal water exclusively from the city's original well system, which drew from uncontaminated sources in the central Woburn area. During this period, no exposure to industrial contaminants through the municipal water supply occurred.

### 1964-1966 Transition Period
Municipal Wells G and H became operational in May 1964 and September 1966, respectively. The Zona residence fell within the eastern distribution zone that received supplemental water from these new sources. Engineering records indicate that approximately 30-40% of the household's water supply originated from Wells G and H during this transitional period, with the remainder continuing to come from the original well system.

### 1966-1979 Maximum Exposure Period
Following the full integration of Wells G and H into the distribution system by late 1966, the Zona household received an estimated 70-85% of its municipal water from these contaminated sources. This period encompasses Michael Zona's birth (March 1966), early childhood development, leukemia diagnosis (September 1972), and death (January 1973).

## WATER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS AND EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT

### Household Water Usage
Based on interviews with Mary Zona conducted on July 15, 1980, the family maintained typical domestic water consumption patterns during the exposure period:

- **Drinking Water:** Primary source for all family members, including preparation of infant formula for Michael beginning March 1966
- **Food Preparation:** All cooking, including boiling water for infant cereal and food preparation
- **Bathing and Hygiene:** Daily bathing for children, with particular attention to infant bathing frequency
- **Domestic Uses:** Laundry, dishwashing, and general household cleaning

### Critical Exposure Windows
The assessment identifies several periods of heightened exposure risk:

1. **In Utero Exposure (1965-1966):** Mary Zona's pregnancy with Michael occurred during the initial operational period of Well G, with documented trichloroethylene contamination levels averaging 267 parts per billion.

2. **Infancy and Early Childhood (1966-1972):** Michael's formative years coincided with peak contamination periods, including the highest recorded trichloroethylene levels of 1,800 parts per billion in samples from Well H collected in 1979.

3. **Pre-Diagnosis Period (1970-1972):** The two-year period preceding Michael's leukemia diagnosis represents the critical window for potential carcinogenic exposure effects.

## INDUSTRIAL SOURCE PROXIMITY ANALYSIS

### W.R. Grace/Cryovac Facility
The Grace facility at 369 Washington Street lies approximately 0.8 miles northeast of the Zona residence. Groundwater flow patterns and geological surveys conducted by the EPA indicate direct hydraulic connection between the Grace property and the aquifer serving Wells G and H. Industrial waste disposal practices at this facility included:

- Surface disposal of trichloroethylene and other organic solvents
- Discharge of process wastewater containing industrial chemicals
- Storage of chemical materials in areas with potential groundwater infiltration

### Beatrice Foods/Riley Tannery Complex
Located approximately 1.2 miles southwest of the Zona residence, the Riley tannery operations under Beatrice Foods ownership involved extensive use of organic solvents and chemical processing agents. Waste disposal practices included discharge of tannery effluent and storage of chemical materials on the 14.73-acre property adjacent to the facility.

## HEALTH IMPACT CORRELATION

### Timeline Correlation Analysis
The temporal relationship between water system operations and Michael Zona's illness presents significant epidemiological indicators:

- **Well G Operation Start:** May 1964
- **Well H Operation Start:** September 1966  
- **Michael's Birth:** March 1966 (during initial contamination period)
- **Leukemia Diagnosis:** September 1972 (6 years after maximum exposure began)
- **Death:** January 1973

### Exposure Duration Assessment
Michael Zona experienced continuous exposure to contaminated municipal water from birth until diagnosis, representing a 6.5-year exposure period during critical developmental stages. The concentration levels documented in 1979 testing (267-1,800 ppb trichloroethylene) suggest sustained exposure to carcinogenic compounds throughout this period.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT

### Municipal Water System Oversight
Investigation of regulatory compliance reveals significant gaps in monitoring and reporting:

1. **Absence of Volatile Organic Compound Testing:** No routine testing for industrial solvents occurred during the 1964-1979 operational period of Wells G and H.

2. **Inadequate Source Water Protection:** No assessment of potential industrial contamination sources was conducted prior to well installation.

3. **Delayed Response to Contamination Discovery:** Wells remained operational for several months after initial contamination indicators were identified.

### Industrial Facility Compliance
Review of available records indicates potential violations of waste disposal regulations by both W.R. Grace Company and Beatrice Foods operations:

- Discharge of industrial waste without proper treatment or containment
- Failure to implement adequate groundwater protection measures
- Inadequate monitoring of chemical storage and disposal areas

## CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Exposure Assessment Findings
The evidence establishes a clear pattern of exposure for the Zona family to industrial contaminants through the municipal water supply during the critical period from 1964 to 1979. The temporal relationship between well operations, contamination levels, and Michael Zona's illness supports further epidemiological investigation.

### Causation Analysis
While definitive causal relationships require additional epidemiological study, the documented exposure pathway, contaminant concentrations, and timing of illness onset provide substantial evidence for potential environmental causation of Michael Zona's leukemia.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Expanded Health Surveillance:** Continue monitoring of other families in the affected service area with similar exposure patterns.

2. **Comprehensive Contamination Assessment:** Conduct detailed geological and hydrogeological studies to fully characterize the extent of groundwater contamination.

3. **Industrial Source Investigation:** Pursue detailed investigation of waste disposal practices at identified industrial facilities.

4. **Legal Coordination:** Provide technical support for potential legal proceedings related to environmental contamination and public health impacts.

## INVESTIGATOR CERTIFICATION
