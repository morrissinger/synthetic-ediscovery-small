## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This hydrogeological assessment summarizes findings from our ongoing investigation into groundwater contamination affecting municipal Wells G and H in East Woburn, Massachusetts. The investigation, initiated following well closure in May 1979, has identified significant volatile organic compound (VOC) contamination sourced from multiple industrial facilities within the Aberjona River Valley watershed. Primary contaminants detected include trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and chloroform at concentrations substantially exceeding proposed federal drinking water standards.

Four industrial facilities have been identified as potential contamination sources: W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc., Beatrice Foods Inc./John J. Riley Company, UniFirst Corporation, and New England Plating Company. Hydrogeological analysis indicates groundwater flow patterns consistent with contaminant migration from these sources toward the municipal well field. The contamination represents a significant public health concern given the wells' operational history from 1964-1979, during which time they supplied drinking water to approximately 5,000 residents in eastern Woburn neighborhoods.

## INTRODUCTION

Municipal Wells G and H commenced operations in 1964 and 1966 respectively as supplemental water sources for the City of Woburn. Located in the Aberjona River Valley, these wells accessed a previously unused aquifer system consisting of glacial outwash deposits overlying bedrock. The wells operated continuously for fifteen years before routine volatile organic compound testing in May 1979 revealed contamination requiring immediate closure.

This assessment presents hydrogeological findings supporting EPA's investigation into contamination sources and migration pathways. The work was conducted in cooperation with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering between September 1979 and May 1980.

## SITE HYDROGEOLOGY

### Geological Setting

The East Woburn area is situated within the Aberjona River Valley, a north-south trending glacial valley filled with unconsolidated sediments. The local stratigraphy consists of:

- **Surface Layer:** Fill material and organic soils (0-5 feet)
- **Upper Aquifer:** Fine to medium sand with gravel lenses (5-40 feet)
- **Confining Layer:** Silty clay and organic deposits (40-55 feet)
- **Lower Aquifer:** Coarse sand and gravel (55-80 feet)
- **Bedrock:** Fractured metamorphic rock (80+ feet)

Wells G and H were screened in both upper and lower aquifer units, with primary production from the lower aquifer system.

### Groundwater Flow Patterns

Hydrogeological investigation included installation of 24 monitoring wells and quarterly water level measurements from September 1979 through March 1980. Key findings include:

1. **Regional Flow Direction:** Southwest to northeast, generally following the Aberjona River Valley trend
2. **Hydraulic Gradient:** Approximately 0.003 ft/ft in the vicinity of Wells G and H
3. **Flow Velocity:** Estimated at 0.5-1.5 feet per day based on aquifer testing
4. **Recharge Sources:** Local precipitation and upgradient industrial areas

Potentiometric surface mapping indicates groundwater flow from identified industrial sources converges in the area of Wells G and H, consistent with observed contamination patterns.

## CONTAMINATION SOURCES

### W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc.

**Location:** 369 Washington Street, East Woburn  
**Operations:** Packaging machinery manufacturing, chemical processing  
**Contaminants of Concern:** Trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene

Site investigation revealed:
- Historical use and storage of chlorinated solvents for degreasing operations
- Multiple waste disposal areas on the 52-acre property
- Documented spills and improper waste handling practices
- Soil contamination exceeding 1,000 ppm TCE in disposal areas
- Groundwater contamination plume extending southwestward toward municipal wells

### Beatrice Foods Inc./John J. Riley Company

**Location:** 228 Salem Street, East Woburn  
**Operations:** Leather tanning, hide processing  
**Contaminants of Concern:** Tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, chromium

Investigation findings include:
- Historical use of chlorinated solvents for hide degreasing
- Waste lagoons and disposal pits on 14.73-acre property
- Soil contamination up to 500 ppm PCE in waste areas
- Groundwater impact extending toward Wells G and H area

### Additional Sources

Two additional facilities show evidence of contributing to regional contamination:

**UniFirst Corporation:** Dry cleaning operations with documented TCE and PCE use
**New England Plating Company:** Metal finishing operations with multiple organic solvents

## WATER QUALITY DATA

### Municipal Wells G and H

Sampling conducted between May 1979 and April 1980 documented the following contamination levels:

**Well G:**
- Trichloroethylene: 267-330 μg/L
- Tetrachloroethylene: 21-28 μg/L
- Chloroform: 12-18 μg/L
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 5-8 μg/L

**Well H:**
- Trichloroethylene: 183-267 μg/L
- Tetrachloroethylene: 15-21 μg/L
- Chloroform: 8-14 μg/L
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 3-6 μg/L

These concentrations substantially exceed proposed federal maximum contaminant levels of 5 μg/L for TCE and PCE.

### Monitoring Well Network

The 24-well monitoring network established around potential source areas and along groundwater flow paths confirms:
- Contaminant plumes extending from each identified source
- Highest concentrations at source areas (up to 15,000 μg/L TCE)
- Decreasing concentrations with distance from sources
- Convergence of contamination toward Wells G and H location

## CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT ANALYSIS

### Migration Pathways

Hydrogeological modeling indicates contaminant transport occurs primarily through:
1. **Advective Transport:** Bulk groundwater movement carrying dissolved contaminants
2. **Hydrodynamic Dispersion:** Mixing processes spreading contamination plumes
3. **Density Effects:** Dense chlorinated solvents potentially creating downward migration

### Travel Times

Based on measured hydraulic parameters:
- **W.R. Grace to Wells G/H:** 8-12 years transport time
- **Beatrice/Riley to Wells G/H:** 6-10 years transport time
- **Other sources:** 10-15 years transport time

These estimates align with operational histories of both contamination sources and municipal wells, supporting causal relationships between industrial activities and well contamination.

## PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS

The contamination of Wells G and H represents a significant public health concern. During their 15-year operational period, these wells supplied drinking water to approximately 5,000 residents in eastern Woburn neighborhoods, including:

- Pine Street area
- East Woburn residential district
- Salem Street corridor
- Adjacent residential developments

Exposure assessment indicates residents consumed contaminated water containing carcinogenic compounds at levels substantially exceeding current health-based standards. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has documented elevated rates of childhood leukemia in areas served by Wells G and H, though definitive causal relationships require additional epidemiological investigation.
