# Letter to Extended Family Regarding Michael's Passing

108 Montvale Road  
Woburn, Massachusetts 01801  
February 24, 1974

Dear Family,

It is with the heaviest of hearts that I write to tell you that our beloved Michael passed away yesterday evening, February 23rd, at home surrounded by his family. He was eight years old. I know this news will come as a shock to many of you, even though we have been fighting this terrible disease for eight months now.

As you know, Michael was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia last June when he was just six years old. What started as tiredness and pale skin that we thought was just normal childhood growing pains turned into something no parent should ever have to face. The doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital did everything they could, and Michael fought so bravely through all the treatments, the chemotherapy, the hospital stays, and the countless trips to Boston. He never complained, not once, even when he was in such pain that it broke our hearts to watch.

These past eight months have been the longest of our lives. Pat has been working extra hours to help with the medical bills, and I've barely left Michael's side except when absolutely necessary. The other children - Patricia, Donna, Robert, and little Susan - have been so understanding, even though this has turned all our lives upside down. They loved their baby brother so much, and he loved them back with everything he had in his small body.

Michael's last weeks were particularly difficult. The treatments that had given us hope in the beginning stopped working, and we could see him getting weaker despite everything the doctors tried. But even in those final days, he would still smile when his brothers and sisters came to sit with him, and he never lost that spark in his eyes that made him our special little boy. The doctors said he didn't suffer at the end, that he simply went to sleep peacefully with Pat and me holding his hands.

I want you all to know how much your letters, phone calls, and visits have meant to us during this terrible time. When Michael was feeling up to it, he loved hearing about his cousins and what everyone was doing. He especially enjoyed the pictures Uncle Frank sent from California, and he kept asking when he would be well enough to visit and see the ocean. Your prayers and support have been the only things that have kept us going through the darkest days.

The wake will be held at the Sullivan Funeral Home on Main Street in Woburn on Tuesday and Wednesday, February 26th and 27th, from 2 to 4 and 7 to 9 both days. The funeral mass will be Thursday morning, February 28th, at 10 o'clock at St. Charles Church on Woburn Street. Father Murphy, who has been so kind to our family throughout Michael's illness, will be celebrating the mass. Michael loved going to church when he was feeling well enough, and I know he would want to have his funeral there.

I keep thinking about how unfair this all is. Michael was such a healthy baby, and he lived such a normal life here in our neighborhood. He played outside with the other children, rode his bicycle, went to school at the Hurld-Wyman Elementary just like his older brothers and sisters did. There was nothing different about him, nothing that should have made him sick like this. The doctors couldn't give us any real answers about why this happened to our little boy. They just said sometimes these things occur, that there's no way to know why some children get leukemia and others don't.

But I've been talking to other mothers in the neighborhood, and it seems like there have been more children getting sick lately than there used to be. Mrs. Anderson's boy Jimmy has been having health problems too, and I've heard whispers about other families dealing with similar troubles. I don't know what it means, if it means anything at all, but it makes a mother wonder if there's something in our water or our air that we don't know about. The city opened those new wells a few years back to give us better water service, and I pray that's not connected to any of this, but these are the thoughts that go through your mind when you're trying to make sense of losing a child.

Pat is taking this very hard, though he's trying to be strong for the rest of us. He keeps saying he should have been able to protect Michael somehow, should have seen the signs earlier, should have demanded more from the doctors. But there was nothing any of us could have done differently. We gave Michael all the love and care we possibly could, and we made sure he knew every single day how much he meant to us.

The medical bills have been overwhelming, even with Pat's insurance from work. The treatments, the hospital stays, the medications - it all adds up to more money than we ever imagined. We're going to be paying for this for years to come, but that doesn't matter now. What matters is that we did everything we could for our son, and I have to believe that counts for something.

I want Michael to be remembered as the happy, loving little boy he was, not just as a child who was sick. He loved baseball and wanted to play Little League when he got older. He was learning to read and was so proud when he could sound out the words in his picture books. He had the sweetest laugh and the biggest heart, always sharing his toys with his brothers and sisters even when they weren't particularly nice to him. He was going to be something special in this world, I know he was.

Please keep our family in your prayers in the days and weeks ahead. I know the pain of losing Michael will never completely go away, but I'm hoping that with time and with the love of family like all of you, we'll find a way to go on. The other children need us to be strong, and I know that's what Michael would want too.

If any of you are planning to come for the services, please don't feel obligated to bring anything or make a fuss. Just having you there to remember Michael with us will be more than enough. He would be so happy to know that his whole family came together to say goodbye to him.

Thank you again for all your love and support during this impossible time. I'll write again soon when I'm feeling more myself. Please give our love to everyone, and know that we are grateful beyond words to have family like you.

With all our love and deepest sorrow,

Joan

P.S. - If anyone wants to make a donation in Michael's memory, we've asked that contributions be made to the Children's Cancer Research Foundation in Boston. Maybe someday they'll find a way to keep other families from going through what we've been through.
