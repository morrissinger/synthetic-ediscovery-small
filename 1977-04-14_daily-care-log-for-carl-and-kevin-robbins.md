# Daily Care Log for Carl and Kevin Robbins

**Thursday, April 14, 1977**

Another difficult night with both boys. Carl III woke up three times complaining of stomach pains, and Kevin had another nosebleed around 2:30 AM. I'm keeping this log like Dr. Morrison suggested, to track their symptoms and see if there are any patterns. Maybe it will help the doctors figure out what's wrong with them.

**Morning (6:00 AM - 12:00 PM):**

Carl woke up pale again, no appetite for breakfast. I offered him his favorite - scrambled eggs and toast - but he only picked at it. His temperature was 99.2°F, not quite a fever but higher than normal. The bruises on his legs seem to be getting darker, especially the ones on his shins that appeared last week. I don't remember him falling or bumping into anything hard enough to cause marks like that.

Kevin was more alert this morning, thank goodness. He ate half a bowl of Cheerios and drank some orange juice. But when he brushed his teeth, I noticed his gums were bleeding again. That's the third time this week. I called Dr. Morrison's office and left a message with the nurse about the bleeding gums. She said to bring him in if it gets worse.

Both boys seem so tired all the time now. Carl used to run around the backyard for hours, playing with his toy trucks and digging in the dirt. Now he just wants to lie on the couch and watch television. Kevin tries to keep up with his older brother, but I can see he's struggling too.

**Afternoon (12:00 PM - 6:00 PM):**

Made the boys grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch. Carl ate about half of his, Kevin finished most of his. I've been giving them extra vitamins like the doctor recommended, but I don't see much improvement. If anything, they both seem to be getting weaker.

Mrs. Anderson from down the street stopped by around 2:00 PM. She wanted to check on the boys since she heard they've been sick. Her Jimmy has been having similar problems - the fatigue, the bruising, the nosebleeds. She mentioned that the Zona family lost their little Michael last month, and now she's worried sick about Jimmy. We talked about how strange it is that so many children in the neighborhood have been getting sick with similar symptoms.

She asked if I've noticed anything different about our water lately. Now that she mentions it, it has had an odd taste for the past few months - kind of chemical-like. I always thought it was just my imagination, but maybe not. Mrs. Anderson said she's been buying bottled water for Jimmy to drink, just in case. I might start doing the same.

Carl took a long nap from 3:00 to 5:00 PM. When he woke up, he complained that his joints hurt, especially his knees and elbows. I gave him some children's Tylenol, but it doesn't seem to help much anymore. Kevin played quietly with his Lincoln Logs while his brother slept, but I noticed he was rubbing his eyes a lot. They've been looking red and watery lately.

**Evening (6:00 PM - Bedtime):**

Dinner was a struggle again. I made their favorite - spaghetti with meat sauce - but neither boy showed much interest. Carl managed a few bites before saying his stomach hurt. Kevin did a little better, but even he left most of his food on the plate. I'm getting worried about their weight. Carl's clothes are starting to hang loose on him, and Kevin looks so thin.

After dinner, I gave both boys their baths. I noticed more of those strange bruises on Carl's back and arms. They're not like regular bruises from playing - they're darker, almost purple, and they seem to appear overnight. I made a note to ask Dr. Morrison about them at our appointment next week.

Kevin's gums bled again when he brushed his teeth. I'm definitely calling the doctor's office first thing tomorrow morning. This can't be normal for a five-year-old.

**Bedtime and Night:**

Got the boys ready for bed around 8:00 PM. Read them a story from their favorite book about trucks and construction equipment. Carl used to love acting out the parts, making engine noises and pretending to drive the big machines. Tonight he just lay there listening, too tired to participate.

Both boys were asleep by 8:30 PM, which is much earlier than usual. I'm grateful they're getting rest, but it worries me that they're so exhausted all the time. Healthy children their age should have energy to burn, not be falling asleep before the sun goes down.

I keep thinking about what Mrs. Anderson said about the water. Could that really be making the children sick? It seems impossible, but then again, so many kids in the neighborhood have been having problems. The Toomey boy, the Gamache child, now Jimmy Anderson, and my two boys. That's a lot of sick children for such a small area.

I've decided to start giving Carl and Kevin bottled water to drink, at least until we can figure out what's causing their symptoms. It might not help, but it can't hurt. I just want my boys to get better. They're so young, and they've been suffering for months now. Dr. Morrison keeps running tests, but nothing seems to give us any answers.

Tomorrow I'm going to call the school and see if other parents have noticed their children getting sick. Maybe if we work together, we can figure out what's happening to our kids. I refuse to just sit here and watch Carl and Kevin waste away without fighting for answers.
