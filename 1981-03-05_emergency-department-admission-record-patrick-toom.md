## PRESENTING HISTORY

Patrick Toomey, a 10-year-old male with a known diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), was brought to the Emergency Department by his parents with a three-day history of worsening abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, and fever reaching 102.4°F. The patient was initially diagnosed with ALL in August 1979 at age 8 years, 11 months, and has been undergoing treatment at Children's Hospital Boston under the care of Dr. Robert Weinstein in the Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology.

According to the mother, Donna Toomey, Patrick began experiencing mild abdominal discomfort on March 2nd, which she initially attributed to a stomach virus. However, the pain progressively worsened, becoming severe and localized to the right lower quadrant. The patient has been unable to keep food or liquids down for the past 24 hours and appears increasingly lethargic and dehydrated.

**Past Medical History:**
- Acute lymphocytic leukemia, diagnosed August 1979
- Currently on maintenance chemotherapy protocol
- No known drug allergies
- Immunizations up to date prior to leukemia diagnosis

**Family History:**
- No family history of cancer or genetic disorders
- Parents and two siblings (ages 12 and 6) in good health
- Family has resided at current Woburn address since 1968

**Social History:**
- Lives with both parents and two siblings

## CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

**Primary Diagnosis:** Acute abdomen with suspected appendicitis in patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia and severe immunocompromise

**Secondary Diagnoses:**
- Acute lymphocytic leukemia, in treatment
- Severe neutropenia (chemotherapy-induced)
- Thrombocytopenia
- Dehydration
- Febrile neutropenia

**Immediate Management:**
1. **Fluid Resuscitation:** IV access established with 22-gauge catheter. Normal saline bolus 500mL administered with improvement in blood pressure and heart rate.

2. **Pain Management:** Morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV administered for pain control. Patient reports improvement from 8/10 to 5/10 on pediatric pain scale.

3. **Antibiotic Therapy:** Given severe neutropenia and clinical presentation concerning for intra-abdominal infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics initiated:
   - Ceftazidime 50 mg/kg IV every 8 hours
   - Metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours

4. **Surgical Consultation:** Dr. Patricia Reynolds from Pediatric Surgery consulted emergently. Surgical evaluation pending, but given patient's immunocompromised state and clinical presentation, operative intervention may be necessary despite increased surgical risks.

5. **Oncology Consultation:** Dr. Weinstein at Children's Hospital Boston contacted. Patient's current chemotherapy regimen to be held pending resolution of acute illness.

**Disposition:**
Patient admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring given:
- Severe immunocompromise with neutropenia
- Possible surgical abdomen requiring intervention
- Need for intensive supportive care and monitoring

**Prognosis:**
Guarded. The combination of acute lymphocytic leukemia, severe treatment-related immunosuppression, and acute abdominal crisis presents significant challenges. The patient's young age and previous response to leukemia treatment are favorable factors, but the current acute illness poses serious risks including sepsis, surgical complications, and potential treatment delays for his underlying malignancy.

**Follow-up:**
- Serial abdominal examinations every 4 hours
- Complete blood count every 12 hours
- Blood culture results pending
- Surgical re-evaluation in 6 hours or sooner if clinical deterioration
- Oncology follow-up once acute crisis resolved
