# ENGINEERING COST ESTIMATE FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTAINMENT SYSTEMS

**Prepared for:** W.R. Grace Company - Woburn Facility  
**Prepared by:** Environmental Engineering Consultants  
**Date:** September 10, 1975  
**Project Reference:** EEC-WRG-75-0910

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Environmental Engineering Consultants has conducted a preliminary assessment of containment system requirements for the W.R. Grace manufacturing facility located at 201 Mishawum Road, Woburn, Massachusetts. This cost estimate addresses the implementation of hazardous waste containment systems to prevent migration of industrial solvents and chemical byproducts from current disposal areas into surrounding groundwater systems.

The proposed containment systems are designed to address potential environmental liabilities associated with trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and other chlorinated organic compounds currently disposed of through on-site methods. Implementation of these systems would demonstrate corporate responsibility and adherence to emerging environmental regulations while protecting local water resources, including municipal Wells G and H located approximately 1,500 feet northeast of the facility.

**Total Project Cost Estimate:** $485,000 - $675,000

## PROJECT SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY

### Site Assessment Overview

The W.R. Grace Woburn facility encompasses approximately 15 acres of industrial property with active manufacturing operations producing Cryovac packaging materials and related chemical products. Current waste disposal practices include:

- On-site lagoons for liquid waste storage (3 active lagoons)
- Drum storage areas for concentrated solvents
- Direct discharge of treated wastewater to municipal system
- Land application of certain industrial byproducts

### Hydrogeological Considerations

The facility sits within the Aberjona River watershed, with groundwater flow patterns indicating northeastern migration toward municipal water supply wells. Soil composition consists primarily of glacial till overlying bedrock at depths of 35-50 feet, with seasonal water table fluctuations between 8-15 feet below surface grade.

### Regulatory Framework

This assessment considers current Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering guidelines and anticipates federal regulations under development by the newly established Environmental Protection Agency. Containment systems are designed to exceed current standards and provide adequate protection against future regulatory requirements.

## RISK ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Environmental Risk Mitigation

Implementation of the proposed containment systems would significantly reduce the risk of groundwater contamination from facility operations. The proximity of municipal Wells G and H necessitates immediate action to prevent potential liability exposure and protect public health. Current disposal practices, while compliant with existing regulations, may not provide adequate protection against future environmental claims.

### Financial Considerations

The investment in containment systems represents approximately 2.3% of annual facility revenue and should be considered essential infrastructure rather than optional environmental enhancement. Failure to implement adequate containment measures could result in:

- Regulatory enforcement actions and associated penalties
- Groundwater remediation costs potentially exceeding $2-3 million
- Legal liability for health impacts on surrounding communities
- Facility closure orders affecting production capacity

### Implementation Priority

Environmental Engineering Consultants recommends immediate implementation of System A (lagoon containment) as the highest priority, given the volume of liquid waste currently stored in unlined lagoons. Systems B and C should follow within 12 months to provide comprehensive environmental protection.

---

## CONCLUSION

The proposed containment systems represent a prudent investment in environmental protection and regulatory compliance for the W.R. Grace Woburn facility. Implementation will demonstrate corporate commitment to environmental stewardship while protecting against potential future liabilities associated with groundwater contamination.

We recommend proceeding with detailed engineering design and permit applications within 30 days to ensure project completion before the 1976 construction season. Our firm is prepared to provide full engineering services throughout the implementation process, including regulatory liaison and construction oversight.
