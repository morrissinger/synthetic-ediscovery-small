# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Legal Team  
**FROM:** Jan Schlichtmann  
**DATE:** January 8, 1982  
**RE:** Legal Team Review of EPA TCE Contamination Findings - Anderson Case Strategy

## Executive Summary

Following our initial consultation with Anne Anderson and the preliminary EPA findings regarding Wells G and H contamination, I am directing the legal team to conduct an immediate comprehensive review of all available evidence linking trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) contamination to the childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn. The death of James Anderson on January 18, 1981, combined with the confirmed presence of industrial solvents in the municipal water supply at concentrations far exceeding safe levels, presents compelling grounds for negligence claims against multiple corporate defendants.

## Key Evidentiary Findings

The EPA's preliminary analysis of Wells G and H has confirmed our worst suspicions regarding the scope of contamination. TCE levels have been documented at 400 parts per billion—a concentration that is 148 times higher than the level associated with one additional cancer case per million people exposed. Additionally, PCE concentrations of 43 parts per billion have been detected in the same water sources that served the Anderson household at 11 Orange Street for seventeen years.

These findings are particularly significant given the timeline of James Anderson's exposure. Born July 16, 1968, James consumed contaminated water throughout his entire prenatal development and childhood. His diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia in January 1972 at age three corresponds directly with the operational period of Wells G and H, which began service in 1964 and 1966 respectively. This temporal relationship strengthens our causation argument considerably.

## Negligence Theory Development

Our negligence claims must focus on the corporate defendants' duty of care regarding hazardous waste disposal practices. The evidence suggests systematic and prolonged contamination patterns that could not have occurred without knowledge or willful disregard for proper disposal protocols. W.R. Grace Company and its subsidiary Cryovac Inc., along with Beatrice Foods and John J. Riley Company, all operated facilities in proximity to the wellhead protection areas during the critical contamination period.

The legal team should prioritize document discovery requests focusing on: (1) internal corporate communications regarding solvent disposal practices from 1964-1980; (2) environmental monitoring data from defendant facilities; (3) waste disposal contracts and vendor relationships; and (4) any correspondence with regulatory agencies regarding groundwater protection measures. These materials will be essential to establishing both actual and constructive knowledge of contamination risks.

## Causation Strategy

While establishing specific causation between TCE/PCE exposure and childhood leukemia presents challenges, the concentration levels documented by EPA, combined with the geographic clustering of cases, provide strong circumstantial evidence. The legal team should immediately begin coordinating with medical experts who can testify regarding the carcinogenic properties of chlorinated solvents and their particular impact on developing children's immune systems.

Anne Anderson's seventeen-year residence at 11 Orange Street, with continuous water service from the contaminated wells throughout James's life, creates an ideal plaintiff profile for demonstrating sustained exposure. The fact that her other children, Christine and Charles, also consumed the same water source but developed different health outcomes may actually strengthen rather than weaken our case by demonstrating the variable susceptibility factors that make childhood leukemia particularly tragic and unpredictable.

I want all team members to understand that this case represents more than a personal injury claim—it is fundamentally about corporate accountability for environmental contamination that has violated the basic trust between industry and community. The Anderson family's tragedy demands that we pursue every available legal remedy with the utmost diligence and preparation.
