### Call to Order:
Meeting called to order at 1:05 PM by President Sullivan. Moment of silence observed for James Anderson, who passed away on January 18, 1981.

### Opening Remarks - Margaret Sullivan:
"We gather today in the shadow of tragedy. The loss of young James Anderson has shaken our entire community, but it has also awakened us to a pattern that can no longer be ignored. Over the past several years, we have witnessed an alarming number of childhood illnesses in our neighborhood, particularly leukemia cases that seem to cluster around certain streets. Today we must confront the possibility that something in our environment may be endangering our children."

### Agenda Item 1: Documentation of Childhood Illness Cases

**Anne Anderson** provided a heartbreaking account of her son James's nine-year battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia, diagnosed when he was only three years old. She emphasized that James had lived his entire life at 11 Orange Street, drinking municipal water from Wells G and H.

**Patricia Toomey** reported that her son Patrick, age 7, was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in September 1980. The family resides at 22 Maple Street and has used municipal water exclusively since moving to the neighborhood in 1975.

**Janet Kane** informed the group that her son Kevin Jr., age 2, was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in November 1980. The Kane family lives at 15 Water Street and has been connected to the municipal water system since 1978.

**Robert Zona** stated that his son Michael, age 5, was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in March 1980. The family has resided at 58 Pine Street since 1977, using municipal water throughout their residence.

**Carl Robbins Sr.** reported that his son Carl III, age 4, was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in August 1980. The Robbins family lives at 12 East Street and has used municipal water since 1976.

**Roland Gamache Sr.** confirmed that his son Roland Jr., age 6, was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in June 1980. The family resides at 67 Trinity Avenue and has been on the municipal water system since 1974.

### Agenda Item 2: Geographic Pattern Analysis

**Dorothy Keefe** presented a hand-drawn map showing the locations of affected families. The clustering pattern revealed that all affected households are located within a roughly half-mile radius and all receive water from municipal Wells G and H, which began operation in 1964 and 1966 respectively.

**Dr. Patricia Murphy** addressed the medical aspects: "The normal incidence of childhood leukemia is approximately 3-4 cases per 100,000 children annually. What we're seeing in East Woburn represents a rate that is statistically impossible by random chance alone. Six cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia in children under age 12 within a concentrated geographic area over such a short timeframe demands immediate investigation."

### Agenda Item 3: Municipal Water Concerns

**Margaret Sullivan** reported on her recent conversations with city officials regarding water quality. She noted that Wells G and H supply water to the eastern portion of Woburn, including all the affected neighborhoods.

**Anne Anderson** raised concerns about the taste and odor of municipal water, stating: "For years, we've noticed that the water sometimes has a chemical smell, especially in the summer months. We complained to the city, but were told it was safe to drink."

**Multiple residents** confirmed similar observations about water quality, including:
- Periodic chemical odors
- Unusual taste, particularly metallic
- Discoloration during certain periods
- Skin irritation after bathing

### Agenda Item 4: Industrial Activity in the Area

**Carl Robbins Sr.** noted the proximity of several industrial facilities to the municipal wells, including operations along the Aberjona River. He expressed concern about potential contamination from industrial waste disposal.

**Robert Zona** mentioned observing trucks dumping materials in wooded areas near Wells G and H during the 1970s, though he could not identify the specific companies involved.

### Agenda Item 5: Proposed Actions

The following actions were unanimously approved by voice vote:

1. **Immediate Water Testing**: Demand comprehensive testing of Wells G and H by independent laboratories, not just routine municipal testing.

2. **Health Department Investigation**: Formally request the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to investigate the childhood leukemia cluster.

3. **Legal Consultation**: Explore legal options for compelling disclosure of industrial activities that may have affected groundwater quality.

4. **Documentation Committee**: Establish a committee to systematically document all health issues in the neighborhood, not limited to leukemia cases.

5. **Media Outreach**: Contact local newspapers and television stations to raise public awareness of the situation.

6. **City Council Pressure**: Organize residents to attend the next Woburn City Council meeting to demand action on water quality concerns.

### Committee Assignments:

- **Documentation Committee**: Anne Anderson (Chair), Patricia Toomey, Janet Kane
- **Media Outreach**: Margaret Sullivan, Dorothy Keefe
- **Legal Research**: Carl Robbins Sr., Roland Gamache Sr.
- **Technical/Scientific Liaison**: Dr. Patricia Murphy (advisor)

### Next Steps:

1. Emergency meeting with Woburn Mayor and City Council scheduled for February 2, 1981
2. Formal letter to Massachusetts Department of Public Health to be sent by January 30, 1981
3. Independent water testing to be arranged through Dr. Murphy's medical contacts
4. Follow-up community meeting scheduled for February 15, 1981

### Closing Remarks:

**Father O'Brien** offered a prayer for the affected families and for guidance in seeking truth and justice. He pledged the support of St. Charles Church in whatever actions the community deems necessary.

**Anne Anderson** concluded: "James fought his battle with courage for nine years. Now it's our turn to fight—not just for our children who are sick, but for all the children in this neighborhood. We owe it to James's memory to find out what happened and make sure it never happens again."

### Adjournment:
Meeting adjourned at 3:45 PM.

**Next Meeting:** February 15, 1981, 1:00 PM, East Woburn Community Center

**Secretary's Note:** This meeting represents the first organized community response to what appears to be an environmental health crisis. The courage of the affected families in sharing their stories and the community's commitment to seeking answers provides hope that we can protect our children and hold responsible parties accountable.
