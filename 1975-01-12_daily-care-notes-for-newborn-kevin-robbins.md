# Daily Care Notes for Newborn Kevin Robbins

**January 12, 1975**  
**7:30 AM**

Kevin had another restless night. Born just three weeks ago on December 20th, and already I'm worried sick about him. He's not like Carl III was as a baby - Carl was such a good sleeper, hardly any fuss at all. But Kevin cries so much, especially at night. The doctor says some babies are just fussier than others, but something feels different about this.

His feeding schedule is all over the place. I've been trying to nurse him every two hours like Dr. Morrison recommended, but he seems to have trouble latching properly. When he does nurse, he often spits up afterward - not just the normal baby spit-up, but what seems like most of what he's taken in. I've started keeping detailed notes because I want to show the doctor exactly what's happening:

- **6:00 AM**: Attempted nursing - took only 5 minutes before pulling away and crying
- **6:15 AM**: Gave 2 oz formula instead - kept down about half
- **6:45 AM**: Large spit-up, seemed uncomfortable
- **7:00 AM**: Changed diaper - loose stool again, third time since midnight

I keep thinking about what happened to little Michael Zona last February. Joan Zona and I used to chat at the grocery store on Main Street, and she mentioned how Michael had been such a sickly baby too - always fussy, trouble keeping food down, frequent infections. Of course, Michael's problems got much worse as he got older, but Joan said the early signs were there from the beginning. The doctors never connected any of it until he got so sick with the leukemia.

Carl keeps telling me I'm worrying too much, that all new mothers go through this anxiety. He reminds me that Carl III turned out fine, even though he had his share of ear infections and colds those first few years. But Carl III was born in 1968, before they opened those new wells. Kevin is different - he was born after we'd been drinking that water for over eight years now.

I've been using the tap water to mix his formula when nursing isn't working, same as I did with Carl III. The water tastes fine - maybe a little metallic sometimes, but the city says it's safe. Still, I can't shake this feeling that something's not right. Kevin's skin has this pale, almost grayish tint that wasn't there the first week. His little fingernails look different too - kind of brittle and discolored.

Mrs. Anderson from Pine Street stopped by yesterday with a casserole. Her Jimmy is about Carl III's age, and she mentioned that he's been having some health problems lately - fatigue, bruising easily, losing weight. She looked so worried when she talked about it. I wanted to ask more questions, but she seemed like she didn't want to discuss it in detail. There's something in the air in this neighborhood, some kind of worry that nobody wants to name out loud.

I called my mother in Medford this morning, and she thinks I should get a second opinion about Kevin's feeding problems. She raised four children and says she's never seen a baby quite like this. Mom suggested I start giving Kevin bottled water for his formula, just to see if it makes a difference. It seems silly - why would our city water be a problem? - but I'm willing to try anything at this point.

The strange thing is, I've been feeling run down myself lately. More tired than I should be, even accounting for the sleepless nights with a newborn. Sometimes I get these headaches that seem to come from nowhere, and my stomach has been upset more often than usual. Carl says it's just the stress of having a new baby, and he's probably right, but I keep wondering if there's something else going on.

I've decided to start keeping more detailed records of everything - Kevin's feeding times, how much he keeps down, his sleep patterns, any changes in his appearance or behavior. If something is wrong, I want to have documentation. I remember Joan Zona saying she wished she had kept better records of Michael's early symptoms, that it might have helped the doctors figure things out sooner.

**Evening Update - 9:45 PM**

Kevin had a slightly better day. He managed to keep down most of his 2 PM feeding, and he slept for almost three hours this afternoon. I started using the bottled water Mom suggested for his formula, and he seemed to tolerate it better. Could just be coincidence, but I'll keep trying it for a few more days.

Carl III helped me give Kevin his bath tonight. He's such a good big brother, always wanting to help. While we were bathing Kevin, Carl III asked why the baby's skin looks "funny" - he said Kevin looks "gray like the sky before it rains." Out of the mouths of babes. Even a six-year-old can see that something's not quite right.

I'm going to call Dr. Morrison's office tomorrow and schedule another appointment. I know he thinks I'm an anxious first-time mother - well, anxious second-time mother - but I need someone to take these symptoms seriously. Kevin deserves better than "some babies are just fussier."

Before bed, I walked around the neighborhood a bit with Kevin in the stroller. The January air was crisp and clean, and it seemed to settle him down. As I walked past the other houses on our street, I found myself wondering about the other families, the other children. How many mothers are lying awake tonight, worried about symptoms they can't quite explain? How many are keeping their own private notes, their own careful observations, hoping someone will eventually listen?

Tomorrow I'll start a new page. Day by day, symptom by symptom, I'll document everything. If Kevin is sick - really sick - I want to be ready with evidence. I want to be the mother who spoke up, who kept records, who fought for answers. Not the mother who wished she had done more.

*God, please let him be okay. Please let this just be normal new baby problems that will resolve on their own. But if it's something more, please give me the strength to fight for him.*
