## WASTE STREAM IDENTIFICATION

**Primary Waste Category:** Chromium-bearing tannery sludge  
**EPA Hazard Classification:** Corrosive/Toxic (pending federal classification)  
**Approximate Volume:** 2,840 gallons liquid waste, 1,200 cubic feet solid sludge  
**Container Type:** Steel drums (55-gallon capacity), concrete settling tanks  

### Chemical Analysis Summary

**Chromium Concentration (Total):** 1,240 ppm  
**Chromium VI (Hexavalent):** 890 ppm  
**pH Level:** 2.8 (highly acidic)  
**Additional Constituents:**
- Sulfuric acid residue: 340 ppm
- Organic tanning agents: 780 ppm
- Suspended solids: 12,400 ppm
- Heavy metals (lead, cadmium): <50 ppm combined

**Testing Laboratory:** Commonwealth Environmental Services, Boston  
**Analysis Date:** February 18, 1975  
**Chain of Custody:** Maintained per company protocol

## DISPOSAL METHODOLOGY

### Primary Disposal Site
**Location:** Company-owned land parcel, rear of main facility  
**Coordinates:** Approximately 200 yards northeast of main tannery building  
**Disposal Method:** Direct discharge to unlined settling ponds  
**Pond Capacity:** 15,000 gallons total across three connected basins  

The chromium-bearing waste generated from this month's hide processing operations has been transferred to our standard disposal ponds following established company procedures. The settling pond system, constructed in 1962, continues to provide adequate containment for our manufacturing byproducts while allowing natural evaporation and soil filtration processes to reduce waste volume over time.

### Secondary Containment Measures
**Overflow Protection:** Earthen berms surrounding pond perimeter  
**Monitoring Wells:** None currently installed  
**Groundwater Depth:** Estimated 8-12 feet below surface  
**Soil Composition:** Sandy loam with clay sublayer at 15-foot depth  

### Weather Conditions During Disposal
**Temperature:** 28°F  
**Precipitation:** Light snow, 0.2 inches accumulated  
**Wind:** Northwest at 8-12 mph  
**Ground Conditions:** Frozen surface, partial ice formation on pond surfaces

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT

### Federal Requirements
Currently no specific federal regulations govern chromium waste disposal from tannery operations. The Environmental Protection Agency has indicated potential future rulemaking regarding heavy metal discharge standards, but no implementation timeline has been established. Company legal counsel has advised continued monitoring of federal developments while maintaining current disposal practices.

### State of Massachusetts Requirements
**Chapter 21E:** Not yet enacted (anticipated 1983)  
**Water Quality Standards:** Under review by state environmental authorities  
**Industrial Discharge Permits:** Not required for on-site disposal  
**Notification Requirements:** None specified for current waste volumes  

The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering has not issued specific guidance regarding chromium disposal standards for leather manufacturing facilities. Our current practices align with industry standards throughout New England and comply with all applicable state regulations as currently written.

## OPERATIONAL NOTES

### Equipment Performance
The centrifuge separation system operated at 87% efficiency during this disposal cycle, representing improved performance compared to January operations (82% efficiency). The primary settling tank required cleaning on February 20th due to accumulated chromium sludge buildup, resulting in temporary storage of approximately 400 gallons in auxiliary containers.

### Personnel Safety Measures
All disposal operations conducted with appropriate personal protective equipment including rubber gloves, safety goggles, and protective clothing. No personnel exposure incidents occurred during this disposal cycle. Monthly safety training conducted February 12th with all environmental crew members present.

### Maintenance Requirements
The pond liner system shows continued deterioration along the eastern perimeter, with visible cracking in the clay base layer. Engineering assessment scheduled for March 15th to evaluate repair options and cost estimates. Current containment remains adequate for normal operations.

## ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

### Visual Inspection Results
**Pond Surface Conditions:** Clear liquid with brown sediment layer  
**Surrounding Vegetation:** Dormant winter condition, no visible stress indicators  
**Wildlife Activity:** Minimal due to seasonal conditions  
**Odor Assessment:** Slight chemical odor within 50-foot radius of disposal site  

### Soil Sampling
No soil sampling conducted this month due to frozen ground conditions. Quarterly sampling program will resume in April 1975 following spring thaw. Previous sampling (November 1974) indicated chromium levels of 45 ppm in soil adjacent to disposal ponds, within acceptable ranges for industrial property.

## WASTE VOLUME PROJECTIONS

### March 1975 Estimates
Based on current production schedules and hide processing requirements, anticipated waste generation for March operations:
- **Liquid chromium waste:** 3,200 gallons
- **Solid sludge:** 1,400 cubic feet
- **Peak daily generation:** 180 gallons (projected March 15-20)

### Annual Disposal Summary (1974)
- **Total chromium waste disposed:** 34,600 gallons liquid, 14,200 cubic feet solid
- **Average monthly volume:** 2,883 gallons liquid, 1,183 cubic feet solid
- **Seasonal variations:** 23% higher volume during fall processing season

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTION ITEMS

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Schedule engineering assessment of pond liner integrity by March 15, 1975
2. Obtain cost estimates for auxiliary containment systems
3. Review federal regulatory developments regarding chromium disposal standards
4. Update personnel training materials to reflect current safety protocols

### Long-term Considerations
The company should evaluate alternative disposal methods as federal environmental regulations continue to develop. Potential options include contracted hazardous waste disposal services or on-site treatment systems to reduce chromium concentrations prior to disposal. Cost-benefit analysis recommended by fourth quarter 1975.

### Documentation Requirements
This manifest will be retained in company environmental files for minimum seven years per company policy. Copies distributed to facility management, corporate environmental office, and legal department for review and filing.
