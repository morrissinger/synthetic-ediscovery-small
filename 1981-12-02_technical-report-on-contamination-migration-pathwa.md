# Technical Report on Contamination Migration Pathways to Municipal Wells G and H, Woburn, Massachusetts

**Prepared by:** Dr. Richard M. Steinberg, P.G., Environmental Geologist

**125 Cambridge Street, Boston, MA 02114**  
**Report No.:** GEA-81-047  
**Date:** December 2, 1981

## Executive Summary

This hydrogeological investigation examines the subsurface contamination pathways that have resulted in the documented presence of chlorinated organic compounds in Woburn Municipal Wells G and H. Through comprehensive analysis of geological formations, groundwater flow patterns, and industrial waste disposal practices, this report establishes clear migration routes from identified source areas to the municipal water supply wells.

The investigation confirms that trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) contamination detected in Wells G and H originated from multiple industrial facilities operating in the area since the 1960s. Groundwater modeling indicates that contaminant plumes have migrated through the glacial outwash aquifer system, following predictable flow paths toward the municipal wells.

## Introduction

Wells G and H, serving the Woburn municipal water system, were constructed in 1964 and 1966 respectively to supplement the city's water supply. These wells are located in a glacial outwash aquifer consisting of highly permeable sand and gravel deposits. Recent water quality testing has revealed the presence of volatile organic compounds, specifically TCE at concentrations up to 400 parts per billion and PCE at concentrations up to 43 parts per billion.

This investigation was commissioned to determine the source and migration pathways of these contaminants, with particular focus on industrial facilities that have utilized chlorinated solvents in their manufacturing processes.

## Site Geology and Hydrogeology

### Regional Geology

The study area is underlain by Pleistocene glacial deposits consisting of:

- **Surface Layer:** 2-8 feet of sandy silt and organic material
- **Glacial Outwash:** 40-80 feet of well-sorted sand and gravel
- **Till Layer:** Dense, low-permeability glacial till
- **Bedrock:** Paleozoic metamorphic rocks at depths exceeding 100 feet

### Aquifer Characteristics

The glacial outwash aquifer exhibits the following properties:
- **Hydraulic Conductivity:** 150-300 feet/day
- **Effective Porosity:** 25-30%
- **Transmissivity:** 8,000-15,000 gpd/ft
- **Groundwater Flow Direction:** Generally northeast toward the Aberjona River

### Water Table Configuration

Groundwater elevations measured in November 1981 indicate:
- Wells G and H are located in a natural groundwater discharge area
- Regional groundwater flow converges toward the well field
- Seasonal variations in water table elevation range from 2-4 feet

## Methodology

### Field Investigation

The investigation included installation of 24 monitoring wells arranged in three transects extending from suspected source areas to Wells G and H. Each monitoring well was constructed with 2-inch diameter PVC casing and 10-foot screens positioned across the water table.

### Sampling and Analysis

Groundwater samples were collected using dedicated bailers and analyzed for volatile organic compounds using EPA Method 601. Quality assurance included:
- Duplicate samples at 10% frequency
- Trip blanks for each sampling event
- Chain of custody procedures
- Laboratory certification verification

### Groundwater Flow Modeling

A two-dimensional finite difference groundwater flow model was developed using the following parameters:
- Grid spacing: 100 feet
- Model domain: 2 miles × 1.5 miles
- Boundary conditions based on observed water levels
- Calibration using 18 months of water level data

## Findings

### Contaminant Distribution

Analytical results reveal distinct contamination plumes emanating from four primary source areas:

**Source Area 1 - W.R. Grace Facility:**
- Location: 300 Washington Street
- Primary Contaminant: TCE (up to 15,000 ppb in source area)
- Plume Length: Approximately 3,200 feet
- Migration Direction: Northeast toward Well G

**Source Area 2 - Cryovac Division:**
- Location: Adjacent to W.R. Grace facility
- Primary Contaminant: PCE (up to 8,500 ppb in source area)
- Plume Length: Approximately 2,800 feet
- Migration Direction: Northeast toward Wells G and H

**Source Area 3 - Beatrice Foods Property:**
- Location: 400 Washington Street
- Primary Contaminants: TCE and PCE (combined concentrations up to 12,000 ppb)
- Plume Length: Approximately 2,600 feet
- Migration Direction: East-northeast toward Well H

**Source Area 4 - Riley Tannery:**
- Location: 200 Salem Street
- Primary Contaminant: TCE (up to 6,200 ppb in source area)
- Plume Length: Approximately 1,800 feet
- Migration Direction: Southeast toward Well H

### Groundwater Flow Analysis

Groundwater flow modeling confirms that all four source areas lie within the capture zones of Wells G and H. Key findings include:

- Average groundwater velocity: 0.8 feet/day
- Travel time from nearest source area to wells: 8-12 years
- Dispersion and dilution factors: 10-25% reduction in concentration over travel distance
- Seasonal variations in flow direction: ±15 degrees from mean direction

### Contaminant Transport Mechanisms

The migration of chlorinated solvents through the aquifer occurs through:

1. **Advective Transport:** Bulk movement with groundwater flow
2. **Mechanical Dispersion:** Mixing due to aquifer heterogeneity
3. **Molecular Diffusion:** Concentration gradient-driven transport
4. **Sorption/Desorption:** Limited retardation due to low organic carbon content

### Temporal Analysis

Historical reconstruction of contamination timing indicates:

- Initial contamination likely began in 1964-1966 period
- Peak contamination arrival at wells: 1972-1976
- Current concentrations represent equilibrium between source loading and natural attenuation

## Conclusions

This investigation establishes clear hydrogeological connections between industrial facilities utilizing chlorinated solvents and the contamination detected in Woburn Municipal Wells G and H. The following conclusions are supported by the technical evidence:

1. **Source Identification:** Four distinct source areas have contributed to well contamination, with the W.R. Grace and Cryovac facilities representing the primary TCE sources, and the Beatrice Foods property contributing both TCE and PCE contamination.

2. **Migration Pathways:** Contaminant plumes follow predictable groundwater flow paths through the glacial outwash aquifer, with travel times consistent with the timing of industrial operations and well contamination detection.

3. **Contaminant Loading:** The concentrations detected in Wells G and H are consistent with the source strengths identified at the industrial facilities, accounting for natural attenuation processes during transport.

4. **Aquifer Vulnerability:** The high permeability and low organic carbon content of the glacial outwash aquifer provide minimal natural protection against organic contaminant migration.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings of this investigation, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Discontinue operation of Wells G and H until contamination levels decrease to acceptable standards
   - Install additional monitoring wells to better delineate plume boundaries
   - Implement quarterly groundwater monitoring at all source areas

2. **Long-term Remediation:**
   - Develop source area remediation plans for each identified facility
   - Consider pump-and-treat systems for groundwater plume containment
   - Evaluate alternative water supply options for affected areas

3. **Regulatory Compliance:**
   - Coordinate with EPA and Massachusetts Department of Public Health
   - Establish cleanup standards based on current health-based criteria
   - Implement institutional controls to prevent future contamination

This technical analysis provides the hydrogeological foundation for understanding how industrial waste disposal practices have compromised the municipal water supply, creating conditions that may have contributed to adverse health impacts in the affected community.
