# INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Harold J. Brennan, Plant Manager  
**FROM:** Robert P. Mitchell, Production Supervisor  
**DATE:** April 28, 1965  
**RE:** Waste Disposal Cost Reduction Measures - Q2 1965 Budget Review

Harold,

Following up on our discussion during yesterday's production meeting, I've completed my review of our current waste disposal procedures and associated costs for the second quarter. As you requested, I'm providing recommendations for immediate cost reduction measures that can be implemented without disrupting our manufacturing schedule or compromising our delivery commitments to Grace headquarters.

Our current waste disposal expenses are running approximately $2,400 per month, primarily for the removal of spent solvents, cleaning agents, and production residues from our film manufacturing operations. The bulk of these costs stem from our contract with Industrial Waste Services of Boston, who transport our containerized waste to their approved disposal facility in Framingham. While this arrangement has served us adequately, the escalating costs are becoming a significant burden on our quarterly operating budget, particularly given the pressure from corporate to maintain profit margins in line with other Grace subsidiaries.

I've identified several opportunities for immediate cost savings that would reduce our disposal expenses by an estimated 60-70% monthly. First, we can eliminate the majority of our spent solvent disposal costs by implementing on-site disposal of these materials in the marshy area behind our facility, adjacent to the Aberjona River. This area is currently unused and would provide adequate capacity for our liquid waste disposal needs. The sandy soil composition in this location appears well-suited for absorption of our waste materials, and the natural drainage would eliminate any concerns about accumulation. Second, we can reduce our solid waste disposal costs by utilizing the vacant lot on our eastern property boundary for burial of contaminated production materials, filters, and other solid residues. This approach has been successfully employed by other manufacturing facilities in the region and would eliminate our reliance on costly commercial disposal services.

These measures would require minimal capital investment—primarily the cost of excavation equipment rental for the initial preparation of disposal areas. I estimate we could implement both disposal methods within two weeks and begin realizing cost savings immediately. The projected annual savings of approximately $17,000 would represent a substantial improvement to our bottom line and demonstrate our commitment to operational efficiency. I recommend we proceed with implementation as soon as possible to maximize the impact on this quarter's financial performance.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if you'd like me to coordinate with maintenance to begin site preparation.
