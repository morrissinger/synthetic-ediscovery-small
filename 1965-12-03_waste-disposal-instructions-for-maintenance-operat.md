# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** All Maintenance Crew Workers  
**FROM:** Harold K. Morrison, Maintenance Supervisor  
**DATE:** December 3, 1965  
**RE:** Revised Waste Disposal Instructions for Maintenance Operations

Effective immediately, all maintenance personnel are to follow the updated procedures outlined below for disposal of waste materials generated during routine maintenance and cleaning operations at our Woburn facility. These instructions supersede all previous disposal guidelines and must be strictly adhered to by all crew members.

## Chemical Waste and Solvent Disposal

All chemical waste materials, including but not limited to trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), cleaning solvents, and degreasing compounds used in equipment maintenance, are to be disposed of in the designated disposal area located behind Building C near the rear property line. This area has been specifically prepared for industrial waste disposal and provides adequate drainage to prevent accumulation of materials on company property. Under no circumstances should these materials be stored in maintenance areas or disposed of through regular municipal waste channels.

When disposing of liquid waste materials, ensure that containers are completely emptied to maximize efficiency and minimize storage requirements. The disposal area is designed to handle substantial volumes of industrial waste, and proper drainage will prevent any interference with normal facility operations. All disposal activities should be conducted during regular working hours to ensure proper supervision and documentation of waste handling procedures.

## Equipment Cleaning and Maintenance Waste

Waste materials generated from cleaning production equipment, including contaminated rags, filters, and cleaning residues, should be collected in the standard metal drums provided for this purpose. These drums are to be transported to the rear disposal area when full, following the same procedures outlined above for chemical waste disposal. This centralized approach ensures efficient handling of all maintenance-related waste materials while maintaining clean and organized work areas throughout the facility.

## Safety and Efficiency Considerations

These disposal procedures have been developed to ensure maximum efficiency in waste handling while maintaining safe working conditions for all personnel. The designated disposal area provides adequate capacity for our current waste generation levels and allows for proper drainage to prevent accumulation of materials that could interfere with facility operations or create safety hazards. All crew members are expected to familiarize themselves with these procedures and implement them consistently in their daily maintenance activities.

Any questions regarding these disposal instructions should be directed to the undersigned. Compliance with these procedures is mandatory for all maintenance personnel, and supervisors will monitor adherence to ensure consistent implementation across all maintenance operations.
