## SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS

During routine maintenance inspection of the outdoor chemical storage area located on the northeast section of company property, I observed significant vapor emissions and chemical odors emanating from the drum storage facility. The conditions documented in this report require immediate attention due to potential safety hazards and operational concerns.

## SITE DESCRIPTION

The outdoor storage facility consists of approximately 200 steel drums containing various industrial solvents and chemicals used in our plastic film manufacturing operations. The drums are arranged in rows of ten, positioned on wooden pallets approximately 18 inches above ground level. The storage area measures roughly 40 feet by 60 feet and is situated approximately 150 yards from the main production building and 300 yards from the eastern property boundary adjacent to the Aberjona River wetlands.

## DETAILED OBSERVATIONS

### Visual Inspection Findings

At approximately 2:45 PM, I observed visible vapor clouds rising from multiple drum locations throughout the storage area. The vapors appeared as a light haze, particularly concentrated around drums in rows 3, 7, and 12. Several drums showed evidence of rust corrosion around the rim seals, with dark staining visible on the wooden pallet surfaces beneath affected containers.

Three drums in row 7 displayed significant bulging of the sidewalls, indicating possible internal pressure buildup. Drum identification numbers observed were: TCE-447, TCE-451, and PCE-459. These drums contained trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene solvents respectively, based on the labeling system established by the chemical procurement department.

### Vapor Detection and Odor Assessment

Strong chemical odors were detectable at a distance of approximately 25 feet from the storage area, with wind conditions carrying the vapors in a generally eastward direction toward the wetland areas. The odors were particularly pronounced near drums containing degreasing solvents, exhibiting the characteristic sweet, chlorinated smell associated with our cleaning operations.

I observed that vapor concentrations appeared heaviest during the warmest part of the afternoon, suggesting that temperature fluctuations may be contributing to increased evaporation rates from compromised drum seals.

### Ground Conditions

The ground surface beneath the drum storage area showed evidence of chemical staining in multiple locations. Dark patches of discolored soil were visible beneath pallets in rows 3, 7, 9, and 12, suggesting possible leakage from drum containers over an extended period. The affected soil areas measured between 2-4 feet in diameter and appeared to have killed vegetation in the immediate vicinity.

Puddles of standing liquid were observed beneath three drums in row 12, with the liquid exhibiting an oily consistency and strong chemical odor. The liquid appeared to be seeping through the wooden pallet structure and pooling on the ground surface.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

Weather conditions during the inspection were clear and sunny, with temperatures reaching approximately 78°F. Wind speed was estimated at 5-8 mph from the southwest, carrying vapors toward the eastern property boundary. These conditions provided optimal visibility for detecting vapor emissions and assessing the extent of chemical releases.

## POTENTIAL CONCERNS

### Safety Hazards

The concentration of vapors in the storage area presents potential health risks to personnel conducting routine inspections or maintenance activities. The strong odors observed suggest solvent concentrations that may exceed safe exposure limits for workers without appropriate respiratory protection.

### Environmental Impact

The eastward drift of chemical vapors raises concerns regarding potential impact on the wetland areas adjacent to our property. Additionally, the evidence of ground contamination beneath leaking drums suggests possible soil infiltration of industrial solvents.

### Operational Issues

The compromised integrity of multiple drum containers threatens the security of our chemical inventory and may result in product loss. The bulging observed in several drums indicates potential safety hazards that could affect nearby storage containers.

## IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Drum Inspection Program**: Implement weekly visual inspection of all outdoor storage drums to identify compromised containers before significant leakage occurs.

2. **Vapor Mitigation**: Consider installation of temporary ventilation or vapor capture systems in the storage area to reduce atmospheric emissions.

3. **Container Replacement**: Priority replacement of drums showing signs of corrosion, bulging, or leakage, particularly units TCE-447, TCE-451, and PCE-459.

4. **Ground Remediation**: Assessment and cleanup of contaminated soil areas beneath affected storage locations.

5. **Weather Protection**: Evaluation of covered storage options to reduce temperature fluctuations that may contribute to vapor emissions.

## FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS REQUIRED

This report documents conditions observed during a single inspection period. Continued monitoring of the outdoor storage facility is recommended to track the progression of identified issues and assess the effectiveness of any corrective measures implemented by management.

I am prepared to provide additional technical support or clarification regarding these observations as needed for operational decision-making.
