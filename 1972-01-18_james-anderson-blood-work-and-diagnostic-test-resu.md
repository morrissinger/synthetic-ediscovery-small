## TESTS PERFORMED

### Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential

**Red Blood Cell Count:** 2.8 × 10⁶/μL *(Reference: 4.0-5.2 × 10⁶/μL)*  
**Hemoglobin:** 6.2 g/dL *(Reference: 11.5-14.5 g/dL)*  
**Hematocrit:** 18.5% *(Reference: 35-45%)*  
**Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** 88 fL *(Reference: 80-100 fL)*  
**Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH):** 28.5 pg *(Reference: 26-34 pg)*  
**Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC):** 32.1% *(Reference: 31-37%)*

**White Blood Cell Count:** 45,200/μL *(Reference: 4,500-11,000/μL)*

### White Blood Cell Differential Count

**Neutrophils:** 15% *(Reference: 50-70%)*  
**Lymphocytes:** 78% *(Reference: 20-40%)*  
**Monocytes:** 4% *(Reference: 2-8%)*  
**Eosinophils:** 2% *(Reference: 1-4%)*  
**Basophils:** 1% *(Reference: 0-1%)*

**Blast Cells:** 68% of total WBC count *(Reference: 0%)*

**Platelet Count:** 28,000/μL *(Reference: 150,000-450,000/μL)*

---

## PERIPHERAL BLOOD SMEAR EXAMINATION

**Morphology Report:**

**Red Blood Cells:** Moderate anisocytosis and poikilocytosis observed. Occasional nucleated red blood cells present (3 per 100 WBC). Polychromasia noted.

**White Blood Cells:** Marked increase in total white cell count with predominance of abnormal lymphoid cells. Numerous blast cells observed with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, fine chromatin pattern, and prominent nucleoli. Blast cells demonstrate morphologic features consistent with lymphoblastic lineage.

**Platelets:** Severely decreased in number. Occasional giant platelets observed.

## ADDITIONAL HEMATOLOGIC STUDIES

### Bone Marrow Aspiration Results
*(Performed January 16, 1972 by Dr. R. Truman)*

**Cellularity:** Hypercellular (95% cellular)  
**Blast Cells:** 85% of nucleated cells  
**Myeloid Series:** 8% of nucleated cells  
**Erythroid Series:** 5% of nucleated cells  
**Megakaryocytes:** Markedly decreased

**Morphologic Assessment:** Bone marrow demonstrates replacement of normal hematopoietic elements by a uniform population of lymphoblasts. Blasts show characteristic morphology with round to oval nuclei, fine chromatin, distinct nucleoli, and scant basophilic cytoplasm.

## CLINICAL CHEMISTRY PANEL

**Glucose:** 98 mg/dL *(Reference: 70-110 mg/dL)*  
**Blood Urea Nitrogen:** 18 mg/dL *(Reference: 8-25 mg/dL)*  
**Creatinine:** 0.7 mg/dL *(Reference: 0.3-1.2 mg/dL)*  
**Total Protein:** 6.8 g/dL *(Reference: 6.0-8.0 g/dL)*  
**Albumin:** 3.2 g/dL *(Reference: 3.5-5.0 g/dL)*  
**Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):** 2,850 U/L *(Reference: 100-250 U/L)*  
**Uric Acid:** 8.2 mg/dL *(Reference: 2.5-6.0 mg/dL)*

## INTERPRETATION AND FINDINGS

The laboratory findings are consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The patient demonstrates:

1. **Severe anemia** with hemoglobin of 6.2 g/dL
2. **Marked leukocytosis** with white blood cell count of 45,200/μL
3. **Severe thrombocytopenia** with platelet count of 28,000/μL
4. **Predominance of lymphoblasts** comprising 68% of circulating white blood cells
5. **Bone marrow replacement** with 85% blast cells

The morphologic characteristics of the blast cells, combined with the clinical presentation and laboratory parameters, support the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (2,850 U/L) indicates significant cellular turnover consistent with rapidly proliferating malignant cells.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate hematology-oncology consultation** for treatment planning
2. **Cytogenetic studies** to further characterize the leukemic cell population
3. **Lumbar puncture** to evaluate for central nervous system involvement
4. **Chest radiograph** to assess for mediastinal involvement
5. **Close monitoring** of complete blood count and clinical status
6. **Supportive care** including blood product transfusion as clinically indicated

---

## TECHNICAL NOTES

All analyses performed using standard laboratory procedures in accordance with Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Quality control measures were within acceptable limits for all assays performed.

**Instruments Used:**
- Coulter Counter Model S for automated cell counts
- Manual microscopic examination for differential count and morphology
- Technicon AutoAnalyzer for chemistry panel
