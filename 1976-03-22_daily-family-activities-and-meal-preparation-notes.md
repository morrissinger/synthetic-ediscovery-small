# March 22, 1976

It's been over two years now since we lost Michael, and some mornings I still catch myself setting out five plates instead of four. Pat says I should stop writing these things down, that it just makes me dwell on what's past, but Dr. Brennan at Mass General said keeping track of everything might be important someday. He didn't say why exactly, but there was something in his voice when he asked about our water and where we lived.

Made pancakes this morning for the kids before school. Used the tap water like always - what else would I use? The water department keeps saying it's fine, but I can't help noticing how it sometimes has that metallic taste, especially in the morning. Tommy complained his pancakes tasted funny, but he's been picky about food ever since Michael got sick. Can't blame him really. We all changed after that.

Pat's been working extra shifts at the plant to help with the medical bills that are still coming in. Even with the insurance, we owe over $3,000 to Mass General, and that doesn't count all the trips back and forth to Boston, the parking fees, the times I had to take unpaid leave to be with Michael during his treatments. Mrs. Anderson from Pine Street stopped by yesterday - her Jimmy is having the same problems Michael had. Same pale look, same tiredness. She wanted to know what doctors we used, what to expect. I gave her Dr. Patterson's number, but my heart just sank looking at her face. She has that same desperate hope I remember having.

The strangest thing is how many kids in the neighborhood have been getting sick. Not just Jimmy Anderson, but the Toomey boy down on Salem Street, and I heard the Gamaches' youngest isn't doing well either. When Michael first got diagnosed, Dr. Patterson said leukemia in children was rare - maybe one case in every 25,000 kids. But here on our few streets, we've got how many now? It doesn't make sense.

I've been keeping a list in the back of my recipe book - not just the sick kids, but where they live, when they got sick, what their symptoms were. Started it after Michael's funeral when Mrs. Kane mentioned her Kevin was having nosebleeds and bruising easy. Same things Michael had before the diagnosis. I don't know why I'm writing it all down, but something tells me it matters.

**Kids I know about:**
- Michael (our boy) - 108 Montvale Road - diagnosed June 1973, died February 1974
- Jimmy Anderson - Pine Street - diagnosed this month
- Kevin Kane Jr. - heard he's not well
- Patrick Toomey - Salem Street area - his mother mentioned he's been tired
- The Robbins boy - Carl, I think - seeing doctors in Boston

All of them live within a few blocks of each other. All of them drink the same water from those wells they put in about ten years ago. Pat says I'm looking for connections that aren't there, but mothers talk to each other. We notice things.

Been having trouble sleeping again. Keep thinking about Michael's last few weeks, how brave he tried to be. He was only eight, but he knew he was getting sicker. Used to ask me if the medicine was working, if he was going to be okay to start Little League in the spring. I lied to him every time, told him of course he would be. What else could I do?

The medical bills keep coming even now. $847 just last week for some tests they ran in January '74. Pat's been talking about taking out a second mortgage, but with interest rates the way they are, I don't know how we'll manage. Sometimes I add up all the costs - not just the hospital bills, but the lost wages, the gas money for all those trips to Boston, the special foods I bought trying to get Michael to eat. It comes to more than we make in a year.

Dr. Brennan asked me last time I saw him if anyone from the health department or the city had ever come around asking questions about Michael's case or the other sick children. I told him no, nobody's ever asked us anything. He wrote something down in his notes and said to call him if anyone ever did want to talk to us. Said it might be important for "establishing patterns." I'm not sure what he meant, but I kept his card.

Made beef stew for dinner tonight. The kids like it, and it stretches the grocery budget. Used the tap water to cook it - same water Michael drank every day of his short life, same water we're all still drinking. Sometimes I wonder if I should be buying bottled water, but that's expensive and Pat would think I'm being foolish. The city says it's safe. The water department tests it. But then why are so many children getting sick?

Tommy asked me today why Michael had to die. How do you explain leukemia to a ten-year-old? How do you explain that sometimes terrible things happen to good people for no reason? But maybe there is a reason. Maybe there's something wrong that nobody wants to admit yet.

Going to call Mrs. Anderson tomorrow to see how Jimmy's doing. And I'll keep writing these notes, even if Pat thinks it's morbid. Something tells me they might matter someday.

The house feels so quiet without Michael's laugh echoing through the halls. Two years, and I still miss him every single day.
