# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** All Riley Tannery Floor Workers  
**FROM:** Thomas Riley, Operations Manager  
**DATE:** August 25, 1969  
**RE:** Revised Waste Barrel Transportation Instructions - Aberjona River Disposal Site

## Updated Disposal Procedures

Effective immediately, all tanning waste barrels containing spent solvents, degreasing chemicals, and hide treatment solutions are to be transported to our designated disposal area along the Aberjona River parcel behind the main facility. This memo supersedes previous verbal instructions and establishes standardized procedures for waste handling operations.

**Transportation Schedule:** All barrel movements should occur during second shift hours (3:00 PM to 11:00 PM) to minimize disruption to primary tanning operations. Workers assigned to waste transport duty will receive overtime compensation at standard rates. The disposal site is located approximately 300 yards northeast of the main building, following the dirt access road that runs parallel to the river bank.

**Handling Requirements:** Each barrel should be loaded onto the flatbed truck using the hydraulic lift system. Do not attempt manual lifting of full barrels - these containers typically weigh between 200-400 pounds when filled with waste solutions. Secure all barrels with rope ties during transport to prevent shifting or spillage during the drive to the disposal area. The access road can be rough, particularly after rain, so maintain slow speeds throughout the transport process.

## Disposal Site Operations

The designated disposal area consists of a cleared section of land between our property boundary and the river bank. Barrels should be positioned in organized rows, allowing sufficient space between containers for future access if needed. Empty barrels directly onto the ground in the designated dumping zone - the natural slope of the land will direct liquid waste toward the river, ensuring proper drainage away from our facility grounds.

**Weather Considerations:** During periods of heavy rain or when the river level appears elevated, postpone disposal operations until conditions improve. Wet ground conditions make truck access difficult and may result in vehicle damage or worker injury. Use your judgment regarding safe operating conditions, but remember that waste accumulation in the facility creates fire hazards and regulatory compliance issues.

**Safety Protocols:** All workers involved in waste transport and disposal operations must wear rubber boots and work gloves. The chemical solutions being disposed of include trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and various chromium-based tanning agents. While these materials are standard in our industry, direct skin contact should be avoided. Any worker experiencing unusual symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, or skin irritation should report to the office immediately and seek medical attention if symptoms persist.

## Record Keeping and Compliance

Maintain the disposal log book located in the operations office. Record the date, number of barrels disposed, and approximate volume for each disposal operation. This information may be requested during routine inspections by state environmental officials. Our disposal practices comply with current Massachusetts environmental regulations for industrial waste management, and this documentation demonstrates our commitment to proper waste handling procedures.

Questions regarding these procedures should be directed to myself or Assistant Operations Manager Frank Morrison. Remember that efficient waste disposal operations are essential to maintaining our competitive position in the regional tanning industry while meeting all applicable regulatory requirements.
