# BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION ANALYSIS REPORT
## Wells G and H Water Samples

**CITY OF WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT**

**Municipal Building, 10 Common Street**  
**Woburn, Massachusetts 01801**

**TO:** Charles F. Murphy, Superintendent  
**FROM:** Robert P. Hennessey, Senior Water Technician  
**DATE:** December 11, 1967  
**RE:** Routine Bacterial Analysis - Wells G and H

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of bacterial contamination testing conducted on water samples collected from Wells G and H during the period of December 4-8, 1967. Testing was performed in accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (12th Edition) and Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines for municipal water supply monitoring.

**Key Findings:**
- Well G: Elevated coliform bacteria detected in 3 of 5 samples
- Well H: Marginal coliform levels in 2 of 5 samples
- Both wells show intermittent bacterial contamination requiring immediate attention
- Chlorination system effectiveness appears compromised

## METHODOLOGY

### Sample Collection
Water samples were collected from Wells G and H at the wellhead prior to chlorination treatment, following established protocols:

- **Collection Period:** December 4-8, 1967
- **Sample Frequency:** Daily at 0800 hours
- **Sample Volume:** 250ml sterile bottles
- **Collection Method:** Direct tap sampling with flame sterilization
- **Chain of Custody:** Maintained per departmental procedures

### Laboratory Analysis
All samples were processed within 6 hours of collection using the Multiple Tube Fermentation Method:

- **Presumptive Test:** Lactose broth incubation at 35°C for 48 hours
- **Confirmed Test:** Brilliant green lactose bile broth at 35°C for 48 hours
- **Completed Test:** Endo agar plates and gram staining for coliform confirmation
- **Quality Control:** Duplicate testing on all positive samples

## RESULTS

### Well G Analysis Results

| Date | Sample ID | Presumptive Test | Confirmed Test | MPN/100ml | Status |
|------|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| 12/4/67 | WG-1204 | Positive | Positive | 7.5 | **FAIL** |
| 12/5/67 | WG-1205 | Negative | N/A | <2.2 | PASS |
| 12/6/67 | WG-1206 | Positive | Positive | 4.5 | **FAIL** |
| 12/7/67 | WG-1207 | Positive | Positive | 11.0 | **FAIL** |
| 12/8/67 | WG-1208 | Negative | N/A | <2.2 | PASS |

**Well G Summary:** 3 of 5 samples exceeded acceptable limits (MPN >2.2/100ml)

### Well H Analysis Results

| Date | Sample ID | Presumptive Test | Confirmed Test | MPN/100ml | Status |
|------|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| 12/4/67 | WH-1204 | Negative | N/A | <2.2 | PASS |
| 12/5/67 | WH-1205 | Positive | Positive | 2.8 | **FAIL** |
| 12/6/67 | WH-1206 | Negative | N/A | <2.2 | PASS |
| 12/7/67 | WH-1207 | Positive | Positive | 3.1 | **FAIL** |
| 12/8/67 | WH-1208 | Negative | N/A | <2.2 | PASS |

**Well H Summary:** 2 of 5 samples exceeded acceptable limits (MPN >2.2/100ml)

### Chlorine Residual Testing

Concurrent chlorine residual testing revealed suboptimal disinfection levels:

- **Well G Distribution:** 0.15-0.25 mg/L (Target: 0.5-1.0 mg/L)
- **Well H Distribution:** 0.20-0.30 mg/L (Target: 0.5-1.0 mg/L)
- **Combined System:** 0.18-0.28 mg/L at distribution points

## ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

The bacterial contamination detected in both Wells G and H represents a significant public health concern requiring immediate corrective action. The intermittent nature of the contamination suggests potential issues with:

1. **Wellhead Integrity:** Possible surface water infiltration during periods of high groundwater flow
2. **Distribution System:** Cross-connections or backflow contamination
3. **Chlorination System:** Inadequate contact time or chlorine feed malfunction

The pattern of contamination is particularly concerning for Well G, which serves the eastern residential areas of Woburn, including Pine Street, Salem Street, and adjacent neighborhoods. The elevated Most Probable Number (MPN) counts indicate the presence of enteric bacteria that could pose health risks to consumers, particularly vulnerable populations including children and elderly residents.

### Comparative Analysis with Previous Testing

Review of quarterly testing records from 1966-1967 shows:
- Well G: Previous intermittent positive results noted in March 1967 (MPN 3.2/100ml)
- Well H: First documented positive results in current testing period
- System-wide chlorine residuals have declined 15% since January 1967

### Potential Sources of Contamination

Field observations during sample collection identified several potential contamination pathways:

1. **Surface Water Infiltration:** Heavy rainfall on December 3-4 may have contributed to groundwater contamination
2. **Industrial Discharge:** Upgradient industrial facilities may be impacting groundwater quality
3. **Agricultural Runoff:** Seasonal farming activities in the Aberjona River watershed
4. **Septic System Leachate:** Residential septic systems in the immediate well vicinity

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Increase Chlorination:** Adjust chlorine feed systems to maintain 0.5-1.0 mg/L residual throughout distribution system
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement daily bacterial testing until consecutive negative results achieved
3. **Consumer Advisory:** Consider issuing precautionary boil water notice for affected service areas
4. **System Flushing:** Conduct systematic flushing of distribution mains in East Woburn

### Long-Term Corrective Measures

1. **Wellhead Protection:** Install sanitary seals and inspect casing integrity for both wells
2. **Cross-Connection Survey:** Conduct comprehensive survey of potential cross-connections in service area
3. **Chlorination System Upgrade:** Install automatic chlorination monitoring and alarm systems
4. **Source Water Protection:** Investigate potential contamination sources in well capture zones

### Regulatory Compliance

Current test results require notification to:
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health within 24 hours
- Woburn Board of Health for local oversight
- Municipal officials for public notification consideration

## CONCLUSION

The bacterial contamination detected in Wells G and H represents a clear violation of drinking water standards and requires immediate corrective action to protect public health. The intermittent nature of the contamination suggests systemic issues with either source water protection or treatment system effectiveness.

Priority must be given to restoring adequate chlorine residuals throughout the distribution system while investigating root causes of the contamination. Continued monitoring and systematic corrective actions will be essential to ensure the safety of Woburn's municipal water supply.

The Water Department's duty of care to residents served by these wells necessitates prompt and comprehensive response to eliminate health risks and restore public confidence in the water supply system.
