## COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, Anne Anderson, individually and as Administratrix of the Estate of James Anderson, deceased, by and through her attorneys, and respectfully alleges as follows:

### PARTIES

**1.** Plaintiff Anne Anderson is a resident of Woburn, Massachusetts, and resides at 11 Orange Street, Woburn, Massachusetts. She is the mother of James Anderson, deceased, and brings this action individually and as duly appointed Administratrix of the Estate of James Anderson.

**2.** James Anderson was a minor child, age twelve (12) at the time of his death on January 18, 1981. He was born on July 16, 1968, and resided with his mother at 11 Orange Street, Woburn, Massachusetts, from birth until his death.

**3.** Defendant W.R. Grace & Co. is a New York corporation doing business in Massachusetts, with a manufacturing facility located at 114 Salem Street, Woburn, Massachusetts.

**4.** Defendant Cryovac, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of W.R. Grace & Co., operating manufacturing facilities in Woburn, Massachusetts.

**5.** Defendant Beatrice Foods Co. is a Delaware corporation doing business in Massachusetts, which owned and operated industrial facilities in Woburn through its subsidiaries.

**6.** Defendant John J. Riley Company is a Massachusetts corporation engaged in industrial operations within Woburn, Massachusetts.

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE

**7.** This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1332, as this action arises under federal environmental statutes and involves citizens of different states with damages exceeding $10,000.

**8.** Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as the defendants conduct substantial business within this District and the events giving rise to this action occurred within this District.

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

**9.** At all times relevant hereto, the City of Woburn operated municipal water wells designated as Wells G and H, which supplied drinking water to residents of East Woburn, including the Anderson family residence.

**10.** Well G commenced operation in May 1964, and Well H commenced operation in October 1966, both drawing groundwater for municipal distribution.

**11.** From birth through death, James Anderson consumed water supplied by Wells G and H through the municipal water system serving 11 Orange Street, Woburn, Massachusetts.

**12.** Upon information and belief, each of the named Defendants operated industrial facilities in Woburn, Massachusetts, and used, stored, handled, transported, and disposed of toxic and hazardous chemicals including but not limited to trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and other chlorinated organic solvents.

**13.** Upon information and belief, Defendants negligently, recklessly, and unlawfully disposed of, discharged, spilled, leaked, and otherwise released said toxic chemicals into the soil and groundwater of Woburn, Massachusetts.

**14.** Said toxic chemicals migrated through the groundwater and contaminated Wells G and H, causing the municipal water supply to contain dangerous concentrations of carcinogenic substances.

**15.** Testing conducted in 1979 revealed trichloroethylene concentrations in Well G of approximately 400 parts per billion, far exceeding safe levels for human consumption.

**16.** Testing further revealed tetrachloroethylene concentrations of approximately 43 parts per billion in the municipal water supply.

**17.** James Anderson was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in January 1972 at age three years and four months.

**18.** James Anderson suffered from leukemia for approximately nine years, enduring extensive medical treatment, hospitalization, pain and suffering, before succumbing to the disease on January 18, 1981.

**19.** Upon information and belief, James Anderson's leukemia was caused by his exposure to carcinogenic chemicals in the municipal water supply contaminated by Defendants' wrongful conduct.

### COUNT I - NEGLIGENCE

**20.** Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

**21.** At all times relevant hereto, Defendants owed a duty of care to James Anderson and other members of the public to exercise reasonable care in the use, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of toxic and hazardous chemicals.

**22.** Defendants breached said duty of care by negligently and carelessly:
    a. Disposing of toxic chemicals in a manner that allowed contamination of groundwater;
    b. Failing to properly contain and control hazardous substances;
    c. Failing to monitor and prevent the migration of toxic chemicals;
    d. Failing to warn authorities and the public of contamination risks;
    e. Continuing operations with knowledge of contamination risks.

**23.** As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' negligent conduct, James Anderson was exposed to carcinogenic chemicals, developed leukemia, and died.

**24.** By reason of the foregoing, James Anderson suffered pain, suffering, medical expenses, and other damages, and Plaintiff Anne Anderson has suffered the loss of her son's companionship, society, and future earnings.

### COUNT II - WRONGFUL DEATH

**25.** Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

**26.** Defendants' wrongful conduct as alleged herein directly and proximately caused the death of James Anderson on January 18, 1981.

**27.** At the time of his death, James Anderson was twelve years of age with a normal life expectancy.

**28.** By reason of James Anderson's wrongful death, Plaintiff Anne Anderson, as Administratrix of his Estate, has sustained damages including but not limited to:
    a. Loss of James Anderson's reasonably expected future earnings;
    b. Medical and funeral expenses;
    c. Loss of companionship, society, and comfort;
    d. Pain and suffering endured by James Anderson prior to death.

### COUNT III - GROSS NEGLIGENCE

**29.** Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

**30.** Upon information and belief, Defendants' conduct constituted gross negligence in that they acted with conscious disregard for the safety of others, including James Anderson.

**31.** Defendants knew or should have known that their disposal and handling of toxic chemicals created substantial risk of harm to persons consuming water from Wells G and H.

**32.** Despite such knowledge, Defendants continued their hazardous practices with reckless indifference to public safety.

**33.** Such gross negligence warrants an award of punitive damages to deter similar conduct and vindicate public policy.

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF

**WHEREFORE,** Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

**A.** Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $1,000,000;

**B.** Award punitive damages in an amount sufficient to deter similar conduct;

**C.** Award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees;

**D.** Award pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

**E.** Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

### JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
