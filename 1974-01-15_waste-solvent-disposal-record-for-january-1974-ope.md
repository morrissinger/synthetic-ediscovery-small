## LAGOON SYSTEM STATUS

### **Lagoon 1 (Primary)**
- **Capacity:** 15,000 gallons
- **Current Level:** Approximately 85% capacity
- **Condition:** Surface partially frozen, visible chemical film
- **Seepage:** Normal infiltration patterns observed
- **Last Maintenance:** December 1973

### **Lagoon 2 (Secondary)**
- **Capacity:** 12,000 gallons  
- **Current Level:** 78% capacity
- **Condition:** Ice formation along edges, chemical odors present
- **Seepage:** Moderate infiltration, some surface pooling noted
- **Last Maintenance:** November 1973

### **Lagoon 3 (Overflow)**
- **Capacity:** 8,000 gallons
- **Current Level:** 92% capacity - NEAR OVERFLOW
- **Condition:** Significant chemical accumulation, discoloration
- **Seepage:** Heavy infiltration patterns, ground saturation evident
- **Last Maintenance:** October 1973

---

## ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATIONS

### **Groundwater Monitoring**
- **Test Well 1:** No formal testing conducted this period
- **Test Well 2:** Visual inspection only - chemical odors detected
- **Test Well 3:** Not accessible due to frozen conditions

### **Surface Water Impact**
- **Drainage Ditch A:** Visible chemical sheen, strong solvent odors
- **Drainage Ditch B:** Discolored water, foam formation observed
- **Storm Water System:** Periodic discharge during thaw events

### **Soil Conditions**
- **Lagoon Perimeter:** Chemical staining evident, vegetation damage
- **Disposal Area:** Ground discoloration, chemical odors in soil
- **Property Boundary:** Some discoloration noted near eastern fence line

---

## OPERATIONAL NOTES

**January 7:** Lagoon 3 approaching capacity. Recommend overflow procedures for next disposal cycle.

**January 9:** Heavy rainfall caused overflow from Lagoon 2 into natural drainage system. Approximately 150 gallons excess discharge estimated.

**January 11:** Maintenance crew reported strong chemical odors from lagoon area during morning inspection. Recommended limiting personnel exposure time.

**January 13:** Frozen ground conditions preventing normal infiltration. Chemical accumulation on surface more pronounced than typical winter operations.

**January 15:** End of reporting period. Total disposal volume within normal operational parameters. Lagoon system functioning as designed for waste processing needs.

---

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

**State Requirements:** Operations conducted in accordance with existing manufacturing permits. No specific waste disposal regulations currently applicable to facility operations.

**Federal Guidelines:** No federal oversight requirements for current disposal methods. Facility operations consistent with standard industrial practices.

**Local Ordinances:** Municipal authorities not notified of routine disposal operations per established protocols.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Lagoon Maintenance:** Schedule spring maintenance for all three lagoons to optimize capacity for increased production schedules.

2. **Overflow Management:** Consider additional temporary storage capacity for peak disposal periods.

3. **Weather Monitoring:** Continue monitoring weather conditions for optimal disposal timing, particularly during freeze-thaw cycles.

4. **Equipment Inspection:** Regular inspection of lagoon integrity and drainage systems to maintain operational efficiency.
