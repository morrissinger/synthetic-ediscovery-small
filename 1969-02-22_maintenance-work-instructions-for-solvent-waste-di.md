## MAINTENANCE WORK INSTRUCTIONS
### Document No. MW-069-022

**TO:** All Maintenance Personnel  
**FROM:** Robert J. McCarthy, Maintenance Supervisor  
**DATE:** February 22, 1969  
**RE:** Revised Procedures for Solvent Waste Disposal Operations

---

## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Effective immediately, all maintenance personnel are required to follow these updated procedures for the disposal of solvent waste materials generated during routine equipment cleaning and maintenance operations. These instructions supersede all previous disposal guidelines and must be strictly adhered to by all shift personnel.

## WASTE CLASSIFICATION

The following solvents and chemical materials are regularly generated during maintenance activities:

- **Trichloroethylene (TCE)** - Primary degreasing solvent for equipment cleaning
- **Perchloroethylene (PCE)** - Secondary cleaning agent for precision components  
- **1,1,1-Trichloroethane** - General purpose cleaning solvent
- **Methylene Chloride** - Paint stripping and adhesive removal
- **Mixed hydrocarbon solvents** - Various petroleum-based cleaning agents

## DISPOSAL PROCEDURES

### Daily Waste Collection

1. **Collection Schedule**: Solvent waste shall be collected from all maintenance areas at the end of each shift (7:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and 11:00 PM).

2. **Container Requirements**: Use only approved 55-gallon steel drums marked with Cryovac inventory numbers. Ensure drums are in good condition with no visible rust or damage.

3. **Labeling**: Each drum must be clearly marked with contents, date of initial use, and responsible maintenance crew designation.

### Temporary Storage

Filled waste drums shall be stored in the designated area behind Building C until disposal arrangements can be made. Maximum storage time is 30 days per drum. Drums showing signs of deterioration or leakage should be reported immediately to the Maintenance Supervisor.

### Final Disposal Methods

**Primary Disposal Location**: The designated disposal area located approximately 300 yards northeast of the main facility, adjacent to the drainage ditch that runs toward the Aberjona River. This location has been selected for its convenient access and natural drainage characteristics.

**Disposal Protocol**:
1. Transport waste drums to disposal area using the maintenance truck during daylight hours when possible
2. Excavate disposal pits approximately 4 feet deep and 6 feet in diameter
3. Pour waste contents directly into excavated pits
4. Cover immediately with available fill material (sand, gravel, or soil)
5. Return empty drums to storage for reuse after basic cleaning

**Alternative Disposal**: When weather conditions prevent access to the primary disposal area, waste may be discharged into the storm drain system located at the southwest corner of the facility. Ensure adequate dilution by running water through the system for several minutes after disposal.

## SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

- Wear rubber gloves and protective clothing when handling waste materials
- Avoid prolonged inhalation of solvent vapors during disposal operations  
- Keep disposal activities away from ignition sources
- Wash hands thoroughly after handling waste containers
- Report any spills or accidents to supervision immediately

## RECORD KEEPING

Maintain disposal logs in the maintenance office showing:
- Date and time of disposal
- Type and estimated quantity of waste disposed
- Personnel involved in disposal operation
- Weather conditions and disposal method used

Submit completed logs to the Plant Manager's office monthly for company records.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

These procedures have been developed to ensure efficient disposal of maintenance waste while minimizing impact on plant operations. The selected disposal locations provide natural containment and dilution of waste materials through soil absorption and groundwater dispersion. Regular monitoring of disposal areas will be conducted by plant personnel to ensure continued effectiveness of these methods.

## COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

All maintenance personnel are expected to follow these procedures without exception. Any deviation from established protocols must be pre-approved by the Maintenance Supervisor. Questions regarding proper disposal methods should be directed to plant supervision immediately.

These instructions are effective as of February 24, 1969, and will remain in force until further notice. All personnel should familiarize themselves with these procedures and ensure proper implementation during all maintenance activities.
