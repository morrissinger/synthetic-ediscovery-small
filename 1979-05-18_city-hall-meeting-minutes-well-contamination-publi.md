### CALL TO ORDER

Mayor Higgins called the emergency meeting to order at 2:00 PM, stating that the purpose was to inform the public regarding recent water quality test results from municipal Wells G and H and to address citizen concerns.

### OPENING STATEMENT - MAYOR HIGGINS

Mayor Higgins opened by acknowledging the serious nature of the meeting and the community's right to be informed about matters affecting public health. He emphasized the city's commitment to transparency and immediate action to protect residents.

"The city has recently received preliminary test results from Wells G and H that require our immediate attention and response. We have called this emergency forum to ensure that all affected residents receive accurate information directly from city officials and state health authorities."

### PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS - DR. ROBERT TRUMAN, CITY HEALTH OFFICER

Dr. Truman presented the following findings from recent water quality testing:

**Well G (Operational since 1964):**
- Trichloroethylene detected at levels of 267 parts per billion
- Additional volatile organic compounds present
- Well located at Pine Street near the Aberjona River

**Well H (Operational since 1966):**
- Trichloroethylene detected at levels of 183 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene also detected
- Well located approximately 1,200 feet from Well G

Dr. Truman explained that these levels significantly exceed acceptable standards for drinking water and that the wells have been immediately shut down as a precautionary measure. He noted that the contamination appears to be from industrial sources, though specific sources have not yet been definitively identified.

**Mrs. Anne Anderson** (East Woburn resident) asked about health effects and whether her family's water consumption over the past fifteen years posed risks to her children. Dr. Truman acknowledged that prolonged exposure to these chemicals could present health concerns but stated that specific health impact assessments would require further study.

### STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT RESPONSE - DR. MICHAEL HIRSCH

Dr. Hirsch from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health outlined the state's immediate response:

1. **Water Supply Replacement:** Alternative water sources are being arranged immediately
2. **Health Assessment:** The Department will conduct a comprehensive health survey of affected neighborhoods
3. **Source Investigation:** Environmental investigators will work to identify contamination sources
4. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Regular testing of all remaining municipal wells

Dr. Hirsch assured residents that the state would coordinate with federal environmental agencies if necessary to ensure a thorough investigation.

### PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR UPDATE - CHARLES RYAN

Director Ryan provided operational details:

- Wells G and H have been permanently shut down effective May 16, 1979
- Water pressure in East Woburn will be maintained through increased pumping from Wells A, B, C, and D
- No interruption in water service is anticipated
- The city will absorb any additional operational costs

### CITIZEN CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS

**Mr. Kevin Kane Sr.** (Woburn Street) expressed concern about his son's recent health problems and asked whether the contaminated water could be related to illness in the neighborhood. Dr. Truman stated that individual health concerns should be discussed with personal physicians, but that the Department of Public Health would be conducting community health assessments.

**Mrs. Mary Toomey** (East Woburn) asked about compensation for potential health effects and property value impacts. City Solicitor Mahoney stated that legal matters would need to be addressed separately and that the city's immediate priority was ensuring safe water supply.

**Mr. Carl Robbins** (Pine Street) questioned why regular testing had not detected these chemicals earlier. Dr. Truman explained that testing for volatile organic compounds was not part of standard municipal water testing protocols until recent years.

**Mrs. Donna Robbins** asked about the source of contamination and whether local businesses were responsible. Mayor Higgins stated that investigations were ongoing but that preliminary assessments suggested industrial activities in the area might be involved.

### DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL SOURCES

City Solicitor Mahoney cautioned against speculation but acknowledged that several industrial facilities operate in the vicinity of the wells:

- W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac facility at 369 Washington Street
- John J. Riley Company tannery operations
- Various smaller manufacturing operations

He emphasized that determining responsibility would require thorough environmental investigation and that the city would cooperate fully with state and federal authorities.
