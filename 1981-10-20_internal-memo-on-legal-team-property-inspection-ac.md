# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Conway Crowley Partners  
**FROM:** Jan Schlichtmann  
**DATE:** October 20, 1981  
**RE:** Legal Team Property Inspection Activities - East Woburn Investigation

## Current Investigation Status

Following the tragic death of James Anderson this past January and our subsequent retention by Anne Anderson and other affected families, our legal team has been conducting comprehensive property inspections and evidence gathering in the East Woburn area. I want to update you on our progress and findings as we build our case against the industrial defendants.

Our investigation has focused on establishing a clear causal link between the contamination of municipal Wells G and H and the childhood leukemia cluster that has devastated this community. Over the past several months, we have conducted extensive site visits to properties owned and operated by W.R. Grace Company, Beatrice Foods, John J. Riley Company, and Cryovac Inc. These inspections have revealed disturbing evidence of improper chemical disposal practices that we believe directly contributed to the groundwater contamination affecting the municipal water supply.

## Key Findings from Property Inspections

At the W.R. Grace facility on Olympia Avenue, our team documented extensive evidence of chemical waste disposal activities. We observed multiple areas where industrial solvents, including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, appear to have been disposed of directly onto the ground or into unlined lagoons. Soil samples collected from these areas show significant contamination levels consistent with the chemicals found in Wells G and H. The proximity of this facility to the wellhead areas strongly suggests a direct pathway for contamination migration through the groundwater system.

The Beatrice Foods tannery operation on Salem Street presents equally concerning evidence. Our inspections revealed that this facility has been using and disposing of various chemical solvents for leather processing operations. We documented areas where waste materials were stored in deteriorating containers and locations where liquid wastes appear to have been discharged directly onto the property. The geological survey data we've obtained indicates that groundwater flow patterns would carry contaminants from this site directly toward the municipal well locations.

## Legal Strategy Implications

These property inspections are providing us with the foundation for establishing corporate liability under both negligence and strict liability theories. The evidence we're gathering demonstrates a pattern of reckless disregard for proper waste disposal protocols and a failure to consider the potential impact on the community's drinking water supply. Each defendant company maintained operations that involved the use and disposal of the exact chemical compounds found in the contaminated wells, and our site investigations are documenting the pathways through which these contaminants reached the municipal water system.

We are coordinating closely with environmental consultants to ensure that our evidence collection meets the technical standards required for expert testimony. The hydrogeological analysis being prepared will demonstrate how contaminants migrated from these industrial sites through the groundwater system to Wells G and H. This technical foundation, combined with the tragic human impact represented by James Anderson's death and the ongoing health threats to other children in the affected area, should provide us with a compelling case for substantial damages.

## Next Steps and Resource Requirements

I recommend that we continue our aggressive investigation timeline while memories remain fresh and physical evidence is still available. We need to complete soil and groundwater sampling at all identified disposal sites before any remediation activities begin that might compromise our evidence. Additionally, we should prioritize obtaining internal company documents related to waste disposal practices and any knowledge these companies may have had about groundwater contamination risks.

The scope of this environmental contamination case will require significant resources, but the potential for establishing precedent in toxic tort litigation makes this investment worthwhile. The Anderson family and other affected families are counting on us to hold these corporations accountable for the devastating impact their operations have had on this community. Our property inspections are providing the evidentiary foundation we need to pursue justice for these families and to ensure that similar environmental disasters are prevented in the future.
