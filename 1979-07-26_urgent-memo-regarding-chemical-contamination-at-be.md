# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Director Thomas P. O'Neill  
**FROM:** Robert M. Sullivan, Senior Environmental Inspector  
**DATE:** July 26, 1979  
**RE:** URGENT - Chemical Contamination Discovery at Beatrice Foods Property Adjacent to Municipal Wells G and H

## Executive Summary

Following our preliminary investigation of the municipal well contamination in East Woburn, I have conducted an intensive site inspection of the Beatrice Foods Inc. property at 228 Salem Street and the adjacent 14.73-acre undeveloped parcel. The findings require immediate departmental attention and coordination with federal authorities. Evidence suggests a pattern of improper waste disposal that may have directly contributed to the contamination of Wells G and H, which served the East Woburn community for fifteen years until their recent closure.

## Site Investigation Findings

During my inspection on July 23-24, 1979, I documented extensive evidence of chemical waste disposal on the Beatrice property. The John J. Riley Company tannery operation, owned by Beatrice Foods Inc. (Delaware corporation, headquarters 2 North LaSalle Street, Chicago), has been disposing of tanning chemicals and organic solvents directly onto the ground surface of the adjacent undeveloped parcel. Soil samples collected from multiple locations show visible staining and emit strong chemical odors consistent with chlorinated solvents.

The proximity of this disposal area to Wells G and H is of critical concern. The undeveloped parcel lies southwest of the municipal wells within the same Aberjona River Valley aquifer system. Given the documented groundwater flow patterns in this area, contamination from the Beatrice property would migrate directly toward the well field. The timing of waste disposal activities, which local residents report have been ongoing since at least the mid-1960s, corresponds precisely with the operational period of Wells G and H (1964-1979).

## Immediate Regulatory Implications

This discovery establishes a clear causal pathway between industrial waste disposal practices and municipal water supply contamination. The evidence suggests violations of state environmental regulations and potentially federal water quality standards. Beatrice Foods Inc., through its ownership of both the tannery operation and disposal site, appears to have maintained a pattern of environmental negligence that directly threatens public health.

The company's disposal practices constitute a clear breach of their duty to prevent contamination of groundwater resources. The creation of a continuing nuisance through chemical waste disposal on property adjacent to municipal water supplies represents a serious violation of both state environmental law and common law principles of property use.

## Recommended Actions

I recommend immediate coordination with the EPA Region I office in Boston to initiate a comprehensive site investigation. We should also notify the Massachusetts Department of Public Health given the potential exposure of East Woburn residents to contaminated water over a fifteen-year period. Legal counsel should be consulted regarding potential enforcement actions against Beatrice Foods Inc. for environmental violations and public health endangerment.

Time is critical. The contamination plume may still be expanding, and other private wells in the area could be affected. I am prepared to brief you on these findings at your earliest convenience and coordinate with federal authorities as directed.
