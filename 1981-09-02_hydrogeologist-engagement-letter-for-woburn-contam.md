Dear Dr. Pinder:

I am writing to formally engage your services as an expert hydrogeologist in connection with a complex environmental contamination case that I believe will require your specialized expertise in groundwater flow modeling and contaminant transport analysis. This matter involves the tragic death of twelve-year-old James Anderson on January 18, 1981, from acute lymphocytic leukemia, along with a disturbing cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn, Massachusetts, which we believe are directly linked to industrial contamination of the municipal water supply.

## Background of the Case

Our investigation centers on the contamination of Woburn's municipal Wells G and H, which have served as the primary water source for the eastern section of the city since their opening in 1964 and 1966, respectively. These wells have been supplying contaminated water to approximately 5,000 residents, including the Anderson family at 11 Orange Street, where Anne Anderson has resided for seventeen years. James Anderson consumed this contaminated water throughout his entire life, from prenatal development through his death at age twelve.

Recent testing conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Environmental Protection Agency has revealed alarming levels of industrial solvents in Wells G and H. Specifically, trichloroethylene (TCE) concentrations have been measured as high as 400 parts per billion—a level that is 148 times higher than the concentration associated with one additional cancer case per million people exposed. Additionally, tetrachloroethylene (PCE) has been detected at levels of 43 parts per billion. Both chemicals are known carcinogens that have been linked to leukemia and other serious health conditions.

Our preliminary investigation has identified several potential sources of this contamination, including industrial facilities operated by W.R. Grace Company and its subsidiary Cryovac Inc., Beatrice Foods, and John J. Riley Company. These entities have historically used and disposed of large quantities of TCE and PCE in their manufacturing processes, and we believe their improper disposal practices have resulted in the groundwater contamination that has poisoned the Woburn water supply.

## Scope of Expert Services Required

Dr. Pinder, your reputation as one of the nation's leading experts in groundwater hydrology and your pioneering work in numerical modeling of contaminant transport make you uniquely qualified to assist us in this case. We require your expertise in the following areas:

**Hydrogeological Site Characterization**: We need a comprehensive analysis of the subsurface geology and hydrogeology in the vicinity of Wells G and H, including the identification of aquifer characteristics, groundwater flow patterns, and the relationship between potential contamination sources and the municipal wells. This analysis should include an evaluation of the Aberjona River valley's geological formations and their influence on groundwater movement.

**Contaminant Transport Modeling**: We require sophisticated numerical modeling to demonstrate how TCE and PCE released at the suspected source locations could have migrated through the groundwater system to reach Wells G and H. This modeling should account for the timing of contaminant releases, the hydrogeological properties of the subsurface materials, and the pumping effects of the municipal wells on groundwater flow patterns.

**Source Identification and Apportionment**: Your analysis should help establish the connection between specific industrial facilities and the contamination found in the municipal wells. We need to demonstrate not only that these facilities are the source of the contamination but also to apportion responsibility among the various potential defendants based on their relative contributions to the groundwater contamination.

**Expert Testimony Preparation**: We anticipate that this case will proceed to trial, and we will require your testimony regarding your findings and conclusions. This testimony will need to be presented in a manner that is comprehensible to a jury while maintaining scientific rigor and accuracy.

## Case Significance and Challenges

Dr. Pinder, I must emphasize the unprecedented nature of this case and the challenges we face. This represents one of the first attempts to hold industrial defendants accountable for groundwater contamination that has resulted in childhood leukemia deaths. The scientific and legal complexities are substantial, as we must establish causation between the defendants' activities and the tragic health outcomes experienced by the Woburn families.

The defendants in this case include major corporations with substantial resources and experienced legal counsel. W.R. Grace Company, in particular, is a Fortune 500 chemical company with operations worldwide, and they will undoubtedly mount a vigorous defense. We expect them to challenge every aspect of our scientific evidence, including the hydrogeological analysis that demonstrates the connection between their facility and the contaminated wells.

Furthermore, the regulatory agencies involved, including the EPA and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, have been slow to respond to this contamination crisis. Wells G and H were not closed until May 1979, despite growing concerns about water quality, and even then, the closure was attributed to poor taste and odor rather than health concerns. It was not until 1981 that comprehensive testing revealed the extent of the chemical contamination.

## Terms of Engagement

We propose to retain your services on an hourly basis at your standard consulting rate of $150 per hour, plus reasonable expenses for travel, laboratory analyses, and other costs directly related to your work on this case. We anticipate that your initial site investigation and preliminary analysis will require approximately 40-60 hours, with additional time needed for detailed modeling work and trial preparation as the case progresses.

We understand that your academic commitments at Princeton University may limit your availability, and we are prepared to work around your teaching schedule. However, given the urgency of this matter and the need to preserve evidence, we would appreciate beginning the hydrogeological investigation as soon as possible, preferably within the next two weeks.

## Confidentiality and Professional Standards

All work performed under this engagement will be subject to attorney-client privilege and work product protection. We will provide you with a detailed confidentiality agreement that addresses the handling of sensitive information related to this case. Additionally, we expect that all work will be performed in accordance with the highest professional and ethical standards, as this case will likely receive significant public and media attention.

## Next Steps

If you are able to accept this engagement, please confirm your availability and provide us with your curriculum vitae and a list of your previous expert witness experience, particularly in cases involving groundwater contamination. We would also appreciate receiving copies of any relevant publications or research that might be applicable to the hydrogeological conditions in the Aberjona River valley.

Upon your acceptance, we will arrange for you to visit the Woburn site and review the available geological and hydrogeological data. We have already begun assembling historical records regarding the industrial activities of the suspected defendants, and we will provide you with access to all relevant documentation as it becomes available.

Dr. Pinder, the families affected by this contamination have endured unimaginable suffering. James Anderson's death represents not just a personal tragedy for Anne Anderson and her family, but a failure of our industrial and regulatory systems to protect public health. Your expertise will be crucial in helping us establish the scientific foundation necessary to hold the responsible parties accountable and to ensure that such tragedies do not occur elsewhere.

I look forward to your response and to working with you on this critically important case. Please feel free to contact me at (617) 227-6020 if you have any questions or require additional information.

Sincerely,

**Jan Schlichtmann**  
Attorney for Plaintiffs
