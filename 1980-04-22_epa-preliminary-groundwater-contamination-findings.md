### AGENDA ITEM 1: OPENING REMARKS

Mayor Rabbitt called the emergency session to order at 3:00 PM, acknowledging the gravity of the situation regarding Wells G and H contamination findings. He emphasized the city's commitment to protecting public health while working cooperatively with federal and state authorities.

Regional Administrator Mitchell thanked the city for convening this urgent meeting and outlined EPA's preliminary findings regarding groundwater contamination in the Aberjona River Valley aquifer system.

### AGENDA ITEM 2: EPA PRELIMINARY CONTAMINATION FINDINGS

Dr. Williams presented comprehensive testing results from Wells G and H, which had been permanently closed in May 1979 following detection of volatile organic compounds. Key findings included:

**Contamination Levels Detected:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 267 parts per billion in Well G, 183 parts per billion in Well H
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 21 parts per billion in Well G, 56 parts per billion in Well H
- Additional chlorinated organic compounds detected at various concentrations
- Contamination levels significantly exceed EPA recommended maximum contaminant levels

**Source Investigation Results:**
Environmental Engineer Chen reported on preliminary source identification efforts focusing on industrial facilities within the watershed area. Investigation has identified potential sources including:

1. **W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc. facility** at 369 Washington Street - Manufacturing operations utilizing TCE and other organic solvents with documented on-site waste disposal practices
2. **Beatrice Foods/John J. Riley Company tannery** at 228 Salem Street - Historical industrial operations with chemical usage and waste disposal on adjacent 14.73-acre property
3. Additional smaller industrial operations requiring further investigation

**Hydrogeological Assessment:**
The contamination appears to have migrated through fractured bedrock aquifer systems, with contaminant plumes extending from industrial source areas toward the well field locations. Groundwater flow patterns indicate contamination likely occurred over an extended period, potentially spanning the entire operational life of Wells G and H (1964-1979).

### AGENDA ITEM 3: PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS

Dr. Mills from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health presented concerns regarding potential health impacts on residents served by the contaminated wells. Approximately 5,000 residents in eastern Woburn neighborhoods received water from Wells G and H during their operational period.

**Health Study Recommendations:**
- Immediate epidemiological investigation of health patterns in affected neighborhoods
- Particular attention to childhood leukemia cases and other potential environmental health indicators
- Coordination with local physicians and health care providers for case identification
- Long-term health monitoring program for exposed populations

Dr. Timpone, Woburn Health Commissioner, reported preliminary observations of unusual health patterns in East Woburn, including what appears to be an elevated incidence of childhood leukemia cases. She recommended immediate collaboration with state and federal health authorities to conduct comprehensive health assessments.

### AGENDA ITEM 4: REGULATORY RESPONSE AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

City Attorney Keating raised questions regarding municipal liability and potential legal remedies against responsible parties. He emphasized the city's position as an innocent party that relied on federal and state environmental regulations to ensure water safety.

Regional Administrator Mitchell outlined EPA's enforcement authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act and emerging Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act provisions. EPA will pursue identification of responsible parties and appropriate cost recovery measures.

**Immediate Regulatory Actions:**
- Formal notification to identified potentially responsible parties
- Expanded environmental investigation of industrial facilities
- Coordination with Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering
- Development of alternative water supply solutions for affected areas

### AGENDA ITEM 5: COMMUNITY COMMUNICATION STRATEGY

Community Relations Coordinator Foster presented recommendations for public information dissemination:

1. **Public Meeting Schedule:** Town hall meetings for affected neighborhoods within two weeks
2. **Information Distribution:** Fact sheets explaining contamination findings and health recommendations
3. **Media Relations:** Coordinated press conferences with city, state, and federal officials
4. **Ongoing Communication:** Regular updates as investigation proceeds

Mayor Rabbitt expressed concerns about community panic and requested EPA assistance in providing clear, factual information to residents while avoiding unnecessary alarm.

### AGENDA ITEM 6: NEXT STEPS AND ACTION ITEMS

**Immediate Actions (Within 30 Days):**
- EPA to complete expanded environmental investigation of potential source areas
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health to initiate comprehensive health study
- City to implement enhanced monitoring of remaining water supply sources
- Legal counsel to prepare documentation for potential cost recovery actions

**Short-Term Actions (30-90 Days):**
- Community health assessments and medical monitoring programs
- Alternative water supply evaluation for affected neighborhoods
- Formal enforcement proceedings against identified responsible parties
- Coordination with federal Superfund program development

**Long-Term Commitments:**
- Ongoing environmental monitoring and remediation oversight
- Health study continuation and medical surveillance
- Legal proceedings for environmental restoration and damages
- Community involvement in all phases of response activities

### DECISIONS MADE

1. **Unanimous Council Resolution:** Supporting full cooperation with EPA investigation and enforcement activities
2. **Health Study Authorization:** Formal request for comprehensive epidemiological investigation by state and federal health authorities
3. **Legal Action Authorization:** Direction to City Attorney to pursue all available legal remedies against responsible parties
4. **Public Information Commitment:** Implementation of comprehensive community communication program

### MEETING ADJOURNMENT

Mayor Rabbitt adjourned the meeting at 5:15 PM, scheduling follow-up sessions as investigation proceeds. He emphasized the city's commitment to protecting public health and holding responsible parties accountable for environmental contamination that has affected thousands of Woburn residents.
