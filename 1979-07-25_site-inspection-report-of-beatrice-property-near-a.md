## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This environmental site inspection was conducted at the Beatrice Foods Inc. property located at 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts, as part of the Department's investigation into potential sources of groundwater contamination affecting municipal Wells G and H. The inspection focused on the 14.73-acre undeveloped parcel adjacent to the John J. Riley Company tannery operations, both owned by Beatrice Foods Inc., a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 2 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois.

The investigation revealed significant evidence of improper waste disposal practices, soil contamination, and potential groundwater impacts that may have contributed to the volatile organic compound contamination detected in the municipal water supply system. Immediate remedial action is recommended to prevent further environmental degradation and protect public health.

## SITE DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

**Property Owner:** Beatrice Foods Inc.  
**Property Address:** 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, MA  
**Assessor's Map:** Block 15, Lot 3A  
**Total Acreage:** 14.73 acres (undeveloped portion)  
**Coordinates:** 42°29'15"N, 71°09'30"W  
**Elevation:** 45-52 feet above sea level  

The subject property is situated within the Aberjona River Valley, approximately 800 feet southwest of municipal Wells G and H. The site consists of relatively flat terrain with a gentle slope toward the Aberjona River, which flows in a northeasterly direction approximately 400 feet north of the property boundary. The underlying geology consists of glacial outwash deposits overlying bedrock, creating conditions conducive to rapid groundwater movement.

The property is bordered by:
- **North:** Residential properties along Salem Street
- **East:** W.R. Grace Company (Cryovac Inc.) facility at 369 Washington Street
- **South:** Aberjona River and associated wetlands
- **West:** Mixed residential and light industrial properties

## METHODOLOGY

The environmental survey employed multiple investigative techniques to assess site conditions and potential contamination sources:

### **Visual Inspection**
Systematic examination of the entire 14.73-acre parcel, including documentation of surface features, waste disposal areas, and evidence of chemical releases.

### **Soil Sampling**
Collection of surface and subsurface soil samples using hand auger techniques at predetermined grid locations. Samples analyzed for:
- Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
- Heavy metals
- pH levels
- Visual and olfactory characteristics

### **Groundwater Assessment**
Installation of temporary monitoring wells to assess groundwater flow direction and quality. Analysis included testing for trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and other industrial solvents.

### **Historical Research**
Review of property records, aerial photographs, and industrial permits to establish timeline of site usage and waste disposal practices.

## FIELD OBSERVATIONS

### **Waste Disposal Areas**

The inspection identified multiple areas of concern across the property:

**Area 1 - Northern Section (Approximate 2.3 acres)**
Located approximately 200 feet from Salem Street, this area contains evidence of systematic waste disposal activities. Observations include:
- Multiple depressions consistent with filled disposal pits
- Discolored soil ranging from dark brown to black
- Strong chemical odors, particularly solvents
- Sparse vegetation with signs of chemical stress
- Surface debris including metal drums and containers

**Area 2 - Central Disposal Zone (Approximate 1.8 acres)**
The most heavily impacted portion of the property, showing clear evidence of long-term waste disposal:
- Exposed chemical waste materials at surface level
- Soil staining extending to depths of 3-4 feet
- Multiple buried containers detected through probing
- Standing water in low areas with visible hydrocarbon sheen
- Dead and dying vegetation in circular patterns

**Area 3 - Eastern Boundary (Approximate 0.7 acres)**
Adjacent to the W.R. Grace property line:
- Evidence of waste migration from neighboring property
- Contaminated soil extending approximately 50 feet onto Beatrice property
- Chemical odors consistent with trichloroethylene
- Disturbed soil suggesting recent disposal activities

### **Tannery Operations Impact**

The active John J. Riley Company tannery operations on the adjacent portion of the Beatrice property have contributed to site contamination through:
- Discharge of process wastewater containing chromium and other heavy metals
- Storage of tanning chemicals in areas with inadequate containment
- Historical disposal of leather processing waste and sludges
- Runoff from chemical storage areas during precipitation events

### **Surface Water and Drainage**

The property's proximity to the Aberjona River creates significant potential for contaminant migration:
- Natural drainage patterns direct surface runoff toward the river
- Seasonal flooding may mobilize buried contaminants
- Groundwater flow direction confirmed as northeast toward Wells G and H
- Evidence of contaminated groundwater discharge to surface water bodies

## FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS

The environmental survey of the Beatrice Foods property has revealed extensive contamination that poses significant risks to groundwater quality and public health. The following findings are of particular concern:

### **Contamination Extent**

The soil and groundwater contamination identified on the Beatrice property is consistent with long-term disposal of industrial waste materials, including solvents and tannery process chemicals. The presence of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene in concentrations exceeding recommended guidelines indicates that improper waste disposal practices have created a persistent source of groundwater contamination.

### **Hydrogeological Conditions**

The site's location within
