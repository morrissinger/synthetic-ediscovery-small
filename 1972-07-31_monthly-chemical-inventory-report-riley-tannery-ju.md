## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report provides a comprehensive overview of chemical inventory levels, consumption rates, and disposal activities at the Riley Tannery facility for the month of July 1972. Current operations remain within normal production parameters, with leather processing volumes consistent with seasonal expectations. Chemical consumption has increased 12% over June levels due to expanded hide processing capacity.

## WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

### Liquid Waste Management

During July 1972, the facility disposed of approximately 2,850 gallons of liquid chemical waste through our established disposal protocols. Waste streams included spent processing solutions, contaminated rinse water, and used solvents. Primary disposal methods included:

**On-site Treatment and Discharge**
- Volume: 1,920 gallons
- Treatment: pH neutralization, settling pond clarification
- Discharge point: Drainage system connecting to municipal storm water infrastructure
- Frequency: Daily discharge of treated effluent

**Off-site Drum Disposal**
- Volume: 930 gallons
- Method: 55-gallon steel drums stored in southeast yard area
- Disposal contractor: Metro Waste Services, Somerville
- Pickup frequency: Bi-weekly collection
- Last pickup: July 20, 1972 (18 drums removed)

### Solid Waste Disposal

Solid chemical waste totaling 1,240 pounds was generated in July, consisting primarily of spent filter media, contaminated rags, and dried chemical residues. Material was containerized in approved steel drums and removed by Metro Waste Services during regular collection cycles.

## OPERATIONAL NOTES

Production efficiency remained high throughout July with minimal equipment downtime. The new degreasing tank installation completed in June has improved solvent utilization rates, though initial consumption patterns show higher than anticipated TCE usage during equipment break-in period.

Weather conditions during the month were favorable for outdoor drying operations, reducing energy costs for heated drying systems. The facility processed 340 hides during July, representing a 15% increase over June production levels.

## SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE

All chemical handling procedures followed established safety protocols. Monthly safety inspection completed July 28 with no significant findings. Employee training on proper solvent handling procedures was conducted July 14 for second-shift personnel.

Storage area ventilation systems operated within normal parameters. No reportable spills or releases occurred during the reporting period. Chemical storage areas maintained in compliance with local fire department requirements.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Inventory Management**: Recommend increasing TCE standing inventory to 1,500 gallons to accommodate expanded production schedule anticipated for August.

2. **Waste Disposal**: Current disposal arrangements adequate for present production levels. Monitor waste generation rates as production increases.

3. **Equipment Maintenance**: Schedule preventive maintenance on main processing tanks for early August to minimize chemical consumption inefficiencies.

4. **Supplier Relations**: Negotiate volume pricing with Chemical Solutions Inc for increased solvent purchases projected through year-end.

## COST ANALYSIS

Total chemical costs for July: $8,420
- Processing chemicals: $4,680 (56%)
- Solvents: $2,890 (34%)
- Disposal costs: $850 (10%)

Chemical costs per processed hide: $24.76, representing a 3% increase over June unit costs due to increased solvent consumption during equipment optimization.
