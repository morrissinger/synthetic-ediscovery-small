# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** William H. Patterson, Facility Manager  
**FROM:** W.R. Grace Safety Committee  
**DATE:** November 28, 1977  
**RE:** Employee Suggestions for Improved Solvent Handling Procedures

## Summary of Employee Recommendations

Following the monthly safety committee meeting held on November 15, 1977, we have compiled employee suggestions regarding current solvent handling and disposal procedures at our Woburn facility. These recommendations arise from floor-level observations and reflect our workforce's commitment to maintaining operational efficiency while addressing practical concerns raised during recent facility inspections.

Several production line supervisors have noted that current protocols for trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) handling could benefit from procedural refinements to reduce material waste and improve workplace conditions. Specifically, employees working in Building 15 have observed that the existing drum storage arrangement near the loading dock occasionally results in minor spillage during transfer operations, particularly during winter months when handling equipment becomes less responsive to standard operating procedures.

## Recommended Procedural Modifications

**Storage and Transfer Operations:** Production staff suggest relocating solvent drum storage to the interior warehouse section to minimize exposure to temperature fluctuations that affect handling equipment performance. This modification would also reduce the frequency of material transfer operations across the facility floor, thereby limiting potential exposure incidents during routine operations.

**Waste Disposal Coordination:** Maintenance personnel recommend establishing a more systematic approach to collecting and consolidating solvent-contaminated materials before disposal. Current practices result in multiple small-batch disposal events that require repeated coordination with our contracted waste management service. A consolidated weekly collection schedule would improve operational efficiency while ensuring proper handling of all contaminated materials.

**Documentation Enhancement:** Administrative staff propose implementing standardized logging procedures for all solvent-related activities to maintain comprehensive records of material usage, storage locations, and disposal scheduling. This documentation system would support our ongoing compliance efforts and provide clear accountability for all handling procedures.

## Implementation Considerations

These employee recommendations align with our facility's operational objectives while addressing practical concerns identified through daily production activities. The suggested modifications require minimal capital investment and can be implemented through existing personnel and equipment resources. We recommend scheduling a follow-up meeting with department supervisors to establish implementation timelines and assign specific responsibilities for each procedural enhancement.

The safety committee believes these improvements will contribute to maintaining our facility's operational standards while demonstrating our continued commitment to responsible industrial practices. We request your authorization to proceed with detailed planning for these procedural modifications, with implementation targeted for the first quarter of 1978.
