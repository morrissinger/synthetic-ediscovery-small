# July 8, 1977

**8:30 AM**

Another sleepless night worrying about Carl. He's been so tired lately, and yesterday at Kevin Kane's birthday party I couldn't help but notice how pale he looked compared to the other boys. Kevin turned nine, same age as Carl, but Kevin seems so much smaller and frailer than he used to be. Mrs. Kane tried to put on a brave face, but I could see the worry in her eyes when Kevin could barely blow out all his candles without getting winded.

The party was at Fells Park, and we mothers all brought our usual - I made my chocolate chip cookies, Anne Anderson brought her famous potato salad, and Joan Toomey made that green Jell-O salad the kids love. But watching our boys play, or try to play, just broke my heart. Carl used to be the fastest runner in the neighborhood, always leading the pack in games of tag. Yesterday he sat on the picnic bench after just a few minutes, saying his legs felt heavy. Kevin Kane Jr. did the same thing, and little Patrick Toomey kept complaining his tummy hurt.

We mothers exchanged those looks - the ones we've been sharing more and more lately. Nobody wants to say what we're all thinking. That something isn't right in East Woburn. That too many of our children are getting sick.

**2:15 PM**

Had coffee with Anne Anderson after we cleaned up from the party. She's been taking Jimmy to Boston Children's Hospital for more tests. The doctors there are asking questions about our neighborhood, about the water, about how long we've lived here. Anne said they wanted to know if other children in the area have been sick. 

I told her about Carl's constant fatigue, how he's been bruising so easily lately, the nosebleeds that seem to come from nowhere. She got that look - the same one Joan Zona had before... before Michael passed. God, I can't even write those words without my hand shaking.

Anne mentioned that Dr. Truman at the hospital said something about checking our well water. She's going to call the town about it. I don't know what good it will do - we've been drinking from Wells G and H for over ten years now. The town always said the water was fine when people complained about the taste and smell.

**6:45 PM**

Bob came home from his shift at the plant looking exhausted. I wanted to talk to him about Carl, about my fears, but he's been working so much overtime lately to pay for all these doctor visits. The medical bills are piling up, and we still don't have any real answers about why Carl has been so sick.

Made meatloaf for dinner - Carl's favorite - but he barely touched it. Just pushed the food around his plate and said he wasn't hungry. His gums looked so pale when he smiled at me. I remember when Michael Zona's mother used to talk about how he lost his appetite near the end. I can't think like that. I won't.

Bob noticed Carl's lack of energy too. After dinner, he tried to get Carl interested in throwing the baseball around in the backyard like they used to do every evening. Carl managed maybe five minutes before he said he needed to lie down. Bob didn't say anything, but I saw him watching Carl walk back to the house, saw the concern creasing his forehead.

**9:20 PM**

Put Carl to bed early again. As I was tucking him in, he asked me why so many kids in our neighborhood get sick. "Like Michael and Jimmy Anderson," he said. "And now Kevin Kane looks sick too at his own birthday party."

What do you tell a nine-year-old? How do you explain something you don't understand yourself? I told him that sometimes people get sick and doctors work hard to make them better. But the truth is, I'm scared. Really scared.

I've been keeping track in my head - Michael Zona died three years ago from leukemia. Jimmy Anderson has been in and out of the hospital with the same thing. Now Kevin Kane Jr. is showing signs, and my own Carl... I can't finish that thought.

After Carl fell asleep, I walked around the house checking all the faucets, looking at the water coming out. It looks clear enough, but there's always been that chemical smell, especially in the summer. The town keeps saying it meets all safety standards, but what if they're wrong? What if whatever killed Michael is in our water, in our air, in our soil?

**10:45 PM**

Can't sleep. Keep thinking about that conversation with Anne today. She mentioned that some of the other mothers have been talking - the Gamaches, the Toomeys, the Kanes. All of us living in the same area, all of our children showing similar symptoms. 

Anne said she's going to start keeping a record of everything - when the kids got sick, what symptoms they have, where exactly we all live. She thinks maybe if we can show the doctors a pattern, they might take us more seriously. Right now they treat each case separately, like Jimmy's leukemia has nothing to do with Michael's, like Carl's fatigue and bruising are unrelated to Kevin's weight loss.

But we mothers know better. We see our children playing together, going to school together, drinking the same water, breathing the same air. We know this isn't coincidence.

I'm going to start writing everything down too. Every symptom, every doctor visit, every time Carl seems worse. If something happens to my boy - no, I can't think that way. But if it does, I want there to be a record. I want someone to be held responsible for what's happening to our children in East Woburn.

Tomorrow I'm calling Dr. Peterson about Carl's latest blood work results. And I'm going to ask him directly - could our water be making our children sick? It's time someone gave us a straight answer.

The house is so quiet now. Bob is snoring softly beside me, and Carl is finally sleeping peacefully in his room. For now, they're both safe, both healthy enough. But I can't shake this feeling that we're running out of time. That whatever is making our children sick is still out there, still in our water, still threatening the ones we love most.

God help us all.
