## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Environmental Consulting Associates has completed the quarterly groundwater monitoring assessment for the W.R. Grace manufacturing facility located at 410 Washington Street, Woburn, Massachusetts. This report presents findings from monitoring wells installed around the facility perimeter and analyzes groundwater quality data collected during the October-November 1977 sampling period.

The monitoring program was established to assess potential migration of industrial compounds from facility operations into the surrounding groundwater system. Results indicate the presence of several organic compounds in groundwater samples, with concentrations varying by location and depth. The facility's proximity to municipal water supply wells requires continued monitoring to ensure compliance with applicable standards.

## SITE DESCRIPTION

The Grace manufacturing facility encompasses approximately 32 acres in the industrial corridor of East Woburn, Massachusetts. The facility has operated continuously since 1953, producing specialty chemical products for industrial applications. Site topography slopes gently eastward toward the Aberjona River, with surface elevations ranging from 42 to 38 feet above mean sea level.

Local geology consists of glacial outwash deposits overlying bedrock at depths of 60-80 feet below ground surface. The shallow aquifer system is composed primarily of sand and gravel with intermittent clay lenses. Groundwater flow direction is generally eastward, following the regional hydraulic gradient toward the Aberjona River valley.

Municipal Wells G and H are located approximately 1,200 and 1,500 feet east-northeast of the facility, respectively. These wells serve as primary water sources for the East Woburn residential area and were placed into service in 1964 and 1966.

## MONITORING WELL NETWORK

The current monitoring well network consists of six monitoring wells installed in March 1976:

- **MW-1:** Located 50 feet north of Building A, screened 15-25 feet below ground surface
- **MW-2:** Located 100 feet east of Building B, screened 20-30 feet below ground surface  
- **MW-3:** Located 75 feet south of waste storage area, screened 18-28 feet below ground surface
- **MW-4:** Located at facility's eastern boundary, screened 22-32 feet below ground surface
- **MW-5:** Located 200 feet downgradient of facility, screened 25-35 feet below ground surface
- **MW-6:** Located upgradient of facility for background comparison, screened 20-30 feet below ground surface

All wells were constructed with 4-inch diameter PVC casing and 10-foot screened intervals. Well development was completed using standard industry procedures to ensure representative sampling conditions.

## SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

Groundwater samples were collected from all monitoring wells on October 15, 1977, and November 8, 1977, following established protocols. Wells were purged of three casing volumes prior to sample collection to ensure representative groundwater quality data. Samples were collected using dedicated bailers and immediately preserved in laboratory-provided containers.

Chain-of-custody procedures were maintained throughout sample collection and transport to Analytical Services Laboratory in Boston, Massachusetts. Samples were analyzed for the following parameters:

- Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and chloroform
- Total dissolved solids (TDS)
- pH and specific conductance
- Heavy metals including chromium and lead

## RESULTS AND FINDINGS

### Volatile Organic Compounds

Trichloroethylene (TCE) was detected in groundwater samples from four of the six monitoring wells. Concentrations ranged from non-detect in the upgradient well (MW-6) to 847 parts per billion (ppb) in MW-3, located near the waste storage area. The spatial distribution of TCE concentrations suggests a source area in the vicinity of Buildings A and B, with migration following the eastward groundwater flow direction.

**TCE Concentrations (ppb):**
- MW-1: 234 ppb
- MW-2: 156 ppb
- MW-3: 847 ppb
- MW-4: 89 ppb
- MW-5: 67 ppb
- MW-6: <5 ppb (non-detect)

Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) was detected in three monitoring wells at lower concentrations, with the highest level of 123 ppb observed in MW-3. Chloroform was detected sporadically across the monitoring network at concentrations ranging from 12 to 45 ppb.

### Physical and Chemical Parameters

Groundwater pH values ranged from 6.2 to 7.1, within the normal range for the regional aquifer system. Specific conductance measurements varied from 280 to 650 micromhos per centimeter, with elevated values observed in wells MW-2 and MW-3, suggesting increased dissolved solids content in these areas.

Total dissolved solids concentrations ranged from 180 to 420 milligrams per liter, with the highest concentrations corresponding to areas of elevated organic compound detection.

### Heavy Metals

Chromium concentrations exceeded background levels in wells MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3, with maximum concentrations of 0.08 milligrams per liter observed in MW-3. Lead was detected at trace levels in two wells but remained below applicable standards.

## DISCUSSION

The groundwater monitoring data indicates the presence of industrial compounds in the shallow aquifer system beneath and downgradient of the Grace manufacturing facility. The spatial distribution of contaminants suggests multiple source areas within the facility, with the highest concentrations observed near the waste storage area and production buildings.

Trichloroethylene represents the primary compound of concern, with concentrations exceeding 800 ppb in some locations. This compound is commonly used in industrial degreasing operations and has been identified as a component of facility processes. The detection pattern indicates ongoing or recent releases to the subsurface environment.

The eastward migration of contaminants follows the regional groundwater flow direction toward the Aberjona River valley. Given the proximity of municipal Wells G and H to the facility, continued monitoring is essential to track contaminant migration and assess potential impacts to the public water supply.

Temporal trends cannot be established from the current data set, as this represents the first comprehensive monitoring effort. However, the widespread distribution of compounds suggests that contamination has been present for an extended period, potentially several years based on estimated groundwater flow velocities.

## CONCLUSIONS

1. **Groundwater contamination** is present beneath the Grace manufacturing facility, with trichloroethylene as the primary compound of concern.

2. **Multiple source areas** appear to exist within the facility boundaries, with the waste storage area representing the most significant source based on contaminant concentrations.

3. **Contaminant migration** is occurring in the eastward direction, following regional groundwater flow toward municipal water supply wells.

4. **Facility operations** appear to be the source of detected compounds based on the spatial distribution and compound types identified.

5. **Public water supply protection** requires ongoing monitoring to assess potential impacts to Wells G and H.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions

1. **Expand monitoring network** to include additional wells between the facility and municipal wells to better define the contaminant plume extent.

2. **Increase sampling frequency** to quarterly intervals to establish temporal trends and assess seasonal variations.

3. **Investigate source areas** within the facility to identify specific release points and implement containment measures.

4. **Review facility operations** to identify processes utilizing detected compounds and evaluate waste management practices.

### Long-term Monitoring

1. **Establish baseline conditions** through continued monitoring of existing wells and expansion of the monitoring network as needed.

2. **Coordinate with municipal authorities** to ensure protection of public water supply wells through appropriate monitoring and response protocols.

3. **Evaluate remediation options** if contaminant migration continues toward sensitive receptors.

4. **Maintain chain-of-custody procedures** and quality assurance protocols to ensure data reliability for regulatory compliance and facility management decisions.

The groundwater contamination identified in this assessment represents a significant environmental concern requiring immediate attention and ongoing monitoring. Environmental Consulting Associates recommends implementation of the proposed monitoring program
