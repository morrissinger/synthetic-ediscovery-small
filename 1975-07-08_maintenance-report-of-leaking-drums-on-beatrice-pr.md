# INCIDENT REPORT

**TO:** Riley Tannery Supervisor  
**FROM:** Maintenance Worker, Riley Tannery Operations  
**DATE:** July 8, 1975  
**TIME:** 10:45 AM  
**RE:** Maintenance Report of Leaking Drums on Beatrice Property

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

During routine morning inspection of the storage area behind the main tannery building on the Beatrice Foods property, I discovered multiple drums showing signs of deterioration and active leakage. The affected containers are located in the northeast section of the property, approximately 150 feet from the main building and 75 feet from the eastern property boundary. This area has been used for temporary storage of various chemical solutions and waste materials from our leather processing operations.

## DETAILED FINDINGS

### Drum Condition Assessment

I counted seventeen (17) fifty-five gallon drums in various states of deterioration. Of these, eight (8) drums show visible rust damage around the bottom seams, with four (4) exhibiting active leakage of liquid contents onto the ground surface. The leaked material appears to be a mixture of chromium-based tanning solutions and organic solvents used in the leather finishing process. The ground beneath and around the leaking drums has become saturated, creating a dark-stained area measuring approximately 20 feet by 15 feet.

The remaining nine (9) drums show surface rust but no visible leakage at this time. However, several exhibit significant corrosion around the rim areas where the lids meet the drum bodies, suggesting potential future failure points. Based on the manufacturer markings still visible on some containers, these drums appear to have been in outdoor storage for at least two to three years.

### Chemical Content Identification

From my knowledge of our tanning operations and the color and odor characteristics observed, the leaking materials likely include:

- Chromium sulfate solutions used in the chrome tanning process
- Trichloroethylene (TCE) used for degreasing leather
- Various organic acids used in the pickling process
- Residual dyes and finishing compounds

The strong chemical odor is particularly noticeable in the morning hours when atmospheric conditions trap vapors close to ground level. I observed that the leaked materials have created visible staining on the soil surface and appear to have penetrated into the ground to an unknown depth.

### Environmental Observations

The storage area sits on gently sloping terrain that directs surface water runoff toward the eastern property boundary. Recent rainfall has created visible channels where contaminated water has flowed away from the drum storage area. I noted that this drainage pattern directs runoff toward the wooded area that separates our property from the residential neighborhood beyond.

The soil in the affected area has taken on an unusual reddish-brown coloration consistent with chromium compounds, and vegetation within a ten-foot radius of the leaking drums appears stressed or dead. Small puddles of standing water in the area have an oily surface film and emit strong chemical odors.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

Upon discovering the leakage, I placed wooden pallets around the most severely affected drums to prevent further spreading of spilled materials. I also covered the leaking drums with canvas tarps to minimize additional water infiltration that could worsen the corrosion and increase leakage rates.

I have cordoned off the immediate area with rope and warning signs to prevent other workers from inadvertently entering the contaminated zone. The area remains accessible for necessary maintenance work but has been marked as requiring caution due to chemical exposure risks.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required (Within 48 Hours)

1. **Drum Removal and Replacement:** All deteriorating drums should be pumped out and their contents transferred to new, intact containers. The four actively leaking drums require immediate attention to prevent further soil contamination.

2. **Soil Assessment:** The contaminated soil area should be evaluated to determine the extent of chemical penetration and appropriate remediation measures. This may require excavation and disposal of affected soil materials.

3. **Drainage Control:** Temporary measures should be implemented to prevent contaminated runoff from leaving our property, particularly during rainfall events.

### Long-Term Recommendations

1. **Storage Facility Improvement:** The current outdoor storage arrangement exposes containers to weather conditions that accelerate corrosion. A covered storage facility would extend container life and reduce environmental exposure risks.

2. **Regular Inspection Schedule:** Implementation of monthly drum inspections would allow early identification of deterioration before leakage occurs.

3. **Waste Minimization:** Review of our chemical usage and waste generation practices may identify opportunities to reduce the volume of materials requiring long-term storage.

## REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

While I am not qualified to make legal determinations, I believe this situation may require notification to appropriate regulatory authorities. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering has been increasing oversight of industrial waste management practices, and unreported chemical releases could result in enforcement actions against the company.

The proximity of residential areas and the potential for groundwater contamination suggest that this incident falls within the scope of environmental regulations that have become more stringent in recent years.

## CONCLUSION

The drum leakage situation represents both an immediate environmental concern and a potential long-term liability for Beatrice Foods operations. The contaminated area requires prompt remediation to prevent further environmental damage and potential regulatory violations. I recommend that management engage appropriate technical experts to develop a comprehensive response plan that addresses both the immediate cleanup requirements and long-term prevention measures.

The current storage practices that led to this situation should be reviewed and modified to prevent recurrence. Investment in proper storage facilities and regular maintenance protocols would reduce both environmental risks and potential regulatory exposure for the company.

I am available to provide additional details about this incident and to assist with implementation of recommended corrective measures.
