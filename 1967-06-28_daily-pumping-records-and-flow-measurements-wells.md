## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE NOTES

### State Department of Public Health Requirements
- Daily pumping records maintained per Chapter 111, Section 160 Massachusetts General Laws
- Flow measurements recorded using certified measuring equipment (last calibration: March 15, 1967)
- Water quality observations documented per standard operating procedures established 1965

### Municipal Water Supply Standards
- Both wells operating within permitted capacity limits
- No exceedances of maximum daily withdrawal rates
- Backup power systems tested and operational

## OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Well H Odor Investigation:** Recommend scheduling investigation of intermittent chemical odor source. Consider consultation with state health department if odor episodes continue.

2. **Pump Efficiency Monitoring:** Both wells showing consistent performance. Schedule routine pump curve analysis for quarterly maintenance review.

3. **Water Level Monitoring:** Static water levels remain stable. Continue daily measurements to track seasonal variations and aquifer response.

4. **Equipment Maintenance:** All equipment functioning within normal parameters. Next scheduled maintenance: July 15, 1967.
