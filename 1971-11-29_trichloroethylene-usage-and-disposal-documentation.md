# TECHNICAL REPORT
## Trichloroethylene Usage and Disposal Documentation

## ABSTRACT

This report documents current trichloroethylene (TCE) usage patterns, storage protocols, and disposal methods at the Cryovac Inc. facility located at 15 Olympia Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts. Analysis covers the period from January 1971 through November 1971, with recommendations for continued operational efficiency in solvent management. Current disposal methods remain consistent with industry standards and provide cost-effective waste management solutions.

## INTRODUCTION

Trichloroethylene serves as a critical degreasing agent in our film production operations, particularly in the cleaning of metal components and equipment maintenance procedures. This chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent has proven essential to maintaining production quality standards while providing superior cleaning capabilities compared to alternative solvents currently available in the market.

The facility currently maintains three primary TCE usage areas: the main production floor degreasing stations, the equipment maintenance bay, and the quality control laboratory. Each area operates under established protocols developed in consultation with chemical supplier representatives and industry best practices as understood at this time.

---

## METHODOLOGY

### Usage Tracking

Daily consumption logs have been maintained by shift supervisors since January 1971. Measurements are recorded in gallons consumed per eight-hour shift, with separate tracking for production operations versus maintenance activities. Monthly reconciliation occurs through inventory management procedures coordinated with the purchasing department.

### Storage Assessment

Current storage capacity consists of four 55-gallon drums maintained in the chemical storage area adjacent to the main production floor. Storage area maintains ambient temperature conditions with standard ventilation systems. Drums are rotated on a first-in, first-out basis to ensure product freshness and prevent degradation.

### Disposal Evaluation

Spent TCE and TCE-contaminated materials are collected in designated waste containers located at each usage point. Collection occurs daily during second shift operations, with consolidation in the waste staging area behind the facility. Disposal coordination follows established arrangements with approved waste management contractors.

## FINDINGS

### Current Usage Patterns

Monthly TCE consumption has averaged 847 gallons from January through October 1971, representing a 12% increase over 1970 consumption levels. This increase correlates directly with expanded production schedules and increased equipment maintenance requirements associated with new machinery installations completed in March 1971.

**Monthly Usage Summary (Gallons):**
- January: 798
- February: 823
- March: 891
- April: 867
- May: 854
- June: 879
- July: 892
- August: 901
- September: 834
- October: 831

Peak usage occurred during July and August, corresponding with maximum production output during summer months. Maintenance-related consumption accounts for approximately 18% of total usage, with the remainder attributed to routine production operations.

### Storage Efficiency

Current storage capacity of 220 gallons (four 55-gallon drums) provides adequate buffer for normal operations while minimizing capital tied up in inventory. Delivery schedules of two drums per month from Hooker Chemical Corporation maintain appropriate stock levels without storage capacity constraints.

No significant storage losses have been documented, though minor evaporation during normal handling operations accounts for approximately 2-3% of total consumption. This loss rate falls within expected parameters for chlorinated solvent operations.

### Disposal Operations

Spent TCE and contaminated materials generate approximately 645 gallons of waste monthly, representing a 76% recovery rate for disposal. The remaining 24% accounts for evaporation losses during normal operations and trace amounts retained in cleaned components.

Current disposal arrangements with Northeast Industrial Services provide cost-effective waste management at $0.18 per gallon for liquid waste and $0.12 per pound for contaminated solid materials (rags, filters, etc.). Pickup occurs bi-weekly on Tuesday mornings, with waste transported to approved disposal sites in accordance with current regulations.

Disposal locations include the company's contracted disposal site located approximately 3 miles northeast of the facility, where liquid wastes are discharged into designated areas that allow for natural soil filtration and eventual groundwater integration. This method provides economical disposal while utilizing natural environmental processes for waste management.

## CONCLUSIONS

Current trichloroethylene management practices provide effective support for production operations while maintaining cost efficiency in both usage and disposal operations. The 12% increase in consumption reflects expanded production capacity rather than inefficient utilization, as evidenced by consistent per-unit consumption ratios.

Storage protocols adequately support operational requirements without excessive inventory carrying costs. The monthly delivery schedule provides appropriate supply security while minimizing storage space requirements and capital investment in chemical inventory.

Disposal arrangements continue to provide reliable waste management services at competitive rates. The bi-weekly pickup schedule prevents accumulation of excessive waste materials while maintaining operational flexibility for production scheduling variations.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Operational Continuity

Maintain current usage protocols and consumption tracking procedures. The established monitoring system provides adequate management visibility into solvent utilization patterns while supporting cost control objectives.

Continue existing storage arrangements with Hooker Chemical Corporation. The current supply relationship provides reliable delivery schedules and competitive pricing for technical-grade trichloroethylene meeting our operational specifications.

### Cost Management

Consider negotiating extended-term pricing arrangements with Northeast Industrial Services for waste disposal operations. Current disposal costs represent approximately 23% of total TCE operational expenses, suggesting potential value in securing fixed pricing for 1972 operations.

Evaluate potential for increased recovery of spent solvent through improved collection procedures. Current 76% recovery rate for disposal may be enhanced through additional collection points and improved handling procedures during equipment cleaning operations.

### Facility Improvements

Install additional ventilation capacity in the main production area degreasing stations to reduce atmospheric losses during normal operations. Enhanced ventilation may reduce the current 2-3% evaporation loss rate while improving working conditions for production personnel.

Consider expansion of waste staging area capacity to accommodate potential increases in production volume anticipated for 1972. Current staging area approaches capacity limits during peak production periods, potentially constraining operational flexibility.
