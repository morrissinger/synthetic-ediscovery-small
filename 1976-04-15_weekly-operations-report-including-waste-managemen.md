# WEEKLY OPERATIONS REPORT

**TO:** Regional Director, Beatrice Foods Corporation  
**FROM:** Operations Manager, Riley Tannery Division  
**DATE:** April 15, 1976  
**RE:** Weekly Operations Report Including Waste Management Activities

## Production Summary

Weekly production levels at the Riley Tannery facility have maintained steady output despite ongoing equipment maintenance issues with our primary processing lines. Total hide processing reached 2,847 units this week, representing a 3% increase over the previous reporting period. The recent installation of additional ventilation equipment in Building C has improved working conditions and allowed for extended operating hours during peak demand periods.

Our leather finishing operations continue to utilize the standard chemical treatment processes, including chromium-based tanning solutions and various organic solvents necessary for quality leather production. Chemical inventory levels remain adequate, with deliveries of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene scheduled for next week to maintain our degreasing and finishing operations. The chemical storage area in the northeast section of the property has been reorganized to improve workflow efficiency.

## Waste Management Operations

Per our established protocols, liquid waste from tanning operations continues to be managed through our on-site disposal system. The settling ponds adjacent to the Aberjona River have been functioning within normal parameters, with regular monitoring of pH levels and visual inspection of discharge quality. This week's disposal activities included approximately 3,200 gallons of process water containing residual tanning chemicals and cleaning solvents.

Our maintenance crew completed repairs to the concrete lining in Pond #2 following the minor crack identified in last week's inspection. The repair work was completed using standard industrial sealant, and the pond has been returned to active service. No significant environmental impact is anticipated from this routine maintenance activity. Ground conditions around the disposal area remain stable, with no unusual seepage or soil discoloration observed during weekly inspections.

## Personnel and Safety Updates

All safety protocols continue to be followed in accordance with company standards. Three minor incidents were reported this week, including one case of skin irritation from chemical contact and two instances of respiratory discomfort during solvent handling operations. All affected employees received appropriate medical attention and have returned to full duty status. Personal protective equipment usage remains consistent with established requirements.

Training sessions on proper chemical handling procedures were conducted for new employees hired in March. These sessions covered appropriate storage, mixing, and disposal procedures for the various chemicals used in our tanning processes. Employee awareness of safety protocols continues to improve, contributing to our overall operational efficiency.

## Equipment and Maintenance

The primary concern this week involves the continued deterioration of our waste processing equipment. The filtration system installed in 1973 requires replacement of several components, including the main settling tank pumps and associated piping. Estimated repair costs total approximately $4,800, with completion expected within three weeks pending parts availability.

Additionally, the underground storage tanks for our chemical inventory have shown signs of age-related wear. While no immediate replacement is required, we recommend scheduling professional inspection within the next six months to assess long-term viability. The tanks currently house approximately 2,000 gallons of various processing chemicals, including degreasing solvents and finishing compounds essential to our operations.

## Regulatory Compliance

All required documentation has been maintained in accordance with state environmental regulations. Weekly water quality reports continue to show compliance with established discharge standards, though some fluctuation in chemical concentrations has been noted during periods of increased production activity. These variations remain within acceptable ranges and do not require immediate corrective action.

The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering conducted their routine quarterly inspection on April 8, 1976. No significant violations were identified, though the inspector noted the importance of maintaining proper documentation for all chemical disposal activities. We have implemented enhanced record-keeping procedures to ensure full compliance with all regulatory requirements.

## Financial Impact

Operating costs for the week totaled $23,450, including $3,200 for chemical purchases and $1,800 for waste disposal activities. These figures represent normal operational expenses consistent with current production levels. The recent increase in chemical costs has been offset by improved efficiency in our processing operations, maintaining overall profitability within acceptable parameters.

Utility costs remain elevated due to increased water usage associated with our expanded cleaning protocols. Monthly water consumption has increased approximately 15% over the previous year, primarily due to enhanced equipment cleaning procedures and quality control measures implemented to ensure product consistency.

## Looking Ahead

Production schedules for the coming week anticipate continued steady output, with potential for increased activity if pending orders from our Boston-area customers are confirmed. Chemical inventory levels are sufficient to support projected operations, with routine deliveries scheduled to maintain adequate supplies.

Weather conditions permitting, we plan to conduct annual maintenance on our outdoor storage areas and disposal facilities. This work will include inspection of all concrete structures, cleaning of drainage systems, and general facility improvements to ensure continued operational efficiency throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.

The ongoing expansion of residential development in the surrounding Woburn area continues to progress without impact on our operations. Municipal water system improvements, including the recent activation of additional wells in the area, should provide adequate water supply for both residential and industrial needs as the community continues to grow.
