**CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS**  
**7 HANOVER SQUARE**  
**NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10005**

**MEMORANDUM TO:** All Grace Subsidiary Managers  
**FROM:** W.R. Grace Legal Department  
**DATE:** March 15, 1965  
**RE:** Corporate Waste Management Policy and Environmental Compliance Guidelines

---

## I. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This policy document establishes uniform guidelines for waste management and environmental compliance across all W.R. Grace Company subsidiaries and manufacturing facilities. These guidelines are promulgated to ensure consistent corporate practices while maintaining operational efficiency and protecting the Company's interests in an evolving regulatory environment.

All subsidiary managers, plant supervisors, and facility operators are required to implement these procedures immediately and ensure full compliance within sixty (60) days of receipt of this memorandum.

## II. WASTE CLASSIFICATION AND HANDLING PROCEDURES

### A. Chemical Waste Categories

**Category I - Aqueous Solutions:**
All water-based chemical solutions, including but not limited to cleaning agents, process rinses, and laboratory waste, shall be managed according to established industrial practices. Facilities may discharge such materials through existing drainage systems provided that:
- Solutions are adequately diluted to reduce concentration
- Discharge occurs during periods of maximum water flow
- Local municipal systems demonstrate adequate capacity

**Category II - Organic Solvents:**
Organic compounds including trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and related chlorinated solvents shall be handled as follows:
- Small quantities (less than 55 gallons) may be disposed through approved industrial waste contractors
- Larger volumes should be consolidated for cost-effective disposal
- Temporary storage in designated areas is acceptable pending disposal arrangements

**Category III - Manufacturing Residues:**
Solid and semi-solid waste products from manufacturing processes, including chemical residues, contaminated materials, and process by-products, shall be managed through:
- On-site burial in designated areas where soil conditions permit
- Consolidation with general industrial waste streams
- Arrangements with local waste management contractors

### B. Documentation Requirements

Facility managers shall maintain records of waste disposal activities, including:
- Quarterly summaries of waste volumes by category
- Contractor agreements and disposal receipts
- Any correspondence with regulatory agencies
- Incident reports involving spills or releases

## III. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

### A. Federal Requirements

The Company recognizes that federal environmental regulations are in a state of development. Facilities shall monitor proposed legislation and regulations that may affect operations, including:
- Water Quality Act provisions
- Proposed air quality standards
- Interstate commerce regulations affecting waste transport
- Federal facility inspection protocols

### B. State and Local Compliance

Subsidiary managers shall maintain awareness of applicable state and local requirements, which may include:
- State water quality standards
- Municipal discharge permits
- Local zoning restrictions on industrial activities
- County health department requirements

**IMPORTANT:** Where state or local requirements conflict with operational necessities, facility managers should consult immediately with Corporate Legal Department for guidance on compliance strategies and risk assessment.

## IV. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

### A. Routine Disposal Operations

**Daily Operations:**
- Process waste may be discharged through existing facility drainage during normal business hours
- Concentrate disposal activities during periods of high municipal water flow to ensure adequate dilution
- Maintain separation between different waste types to prevent adverse chemical reactions

**Periodic Activities:**
- Conduct monthly inspections of storage areas and disposal sites
- Review contractor performance and cost-effectiveness quarterly
- Assess facility drainage and disposal capacity annually

### B. Emergency Procedures

In the event of accidental releases, spills, or equipment failures:
- Contain release using available materials (sand, absorbent materials, temporary barriers)
- Document incident details including time, location, materials involved, and response actions
- Notify Corporate Legal Department within 48 hours of any incident that may result in off-site impacts
- Coordinate with local authorities only as required by law or when specifically directed by Corporate Legal

## V. COST MANAGEMENT AND EFFICIENCY

### A. Disposal Cost Optimization

Facility managers are expected to implement cost-effective waste management practices:
- Consolidate similar waste streams to achieve economies of scale
- Negotiate favorable terms with disposal contractors
- Utilize on-site disposal methods where feasible and appropriate
- Minimize contractor fees through efficient scheduling and volume management

### B. Capital Improvements

Facilities should consider infrastructure improvements that enhance disposal efficiency:
- Upgraded drainage systems to handle increased volumes
- Improved storage capabilities for temporary waste accumulation
- Enhanced containment systems for high-value waste streams
- Process modifications that reduce waste generation

## VI. RISK MANAGEMENT AND LIABILITY PROTECTION

### A. Corporate Liability Considerations

The Company's primary obligation is to shareholders and business continuity. Environmental compliance activities should be balanced against:
- Operational efficiency requirements
- Competitive market positioning
- Capital allocation priorities
- Regulatory uncertainty and changing requirements

### B. Documentation and Communication

**Internal Communications:**
- Limit written documentation of disposal activities to essential business records
- Avoid speculative language regarding environmental impacts
- Focus documentation on operational efficiency and cost management
- Coordinate with Corporate Legal before responding to any external inquiries

**External Relations:**
- Maintain cooperative relationships with local officials while protecting Company interests
- Respond to community concerns through appropriate corporate representatives
- Direct all regulatory inquiries to Corporate Legal Department
- Avoid commitments or statements that may create unnecessary legal obligations

## VII. IMPLEMENTATION AND OVERSIGHT

### A. Management Responsibilities

**Facility Managers:**
- Implement these guidelines within 60 days
- Train supervisory staff on proper procedures
- Monitor compliance with established protocols
- Report quarterly to Corporate on implementation progress

**Corporate Oversight:**
- Legal Department will conduct periodic facility reviews
- Environmental compliance will be integrated into annual performance evaluations
- Corporate will provide updated guidance as regulatory environment evolves
- Support will be available for facilities facing unusual compliance challenges

### B. Performance Standards

Facilities will be evaluated based on:
- Effective implementation of waste management procedures
- Cost efficiency in disposal operations
- Absence of regulatory violations or enforcement actions
- Maintenance of operational flexibility and business continuity

## VIII. REGULATORY MONITORING AND ADAPTATION

The regulatory environment affecting industrial waste management continues to evolve at federal, state, and local levels. Corporate Legal Department will monitor developments and provide updated guidance as necessary.

Facility managers should be aware that future regulations may require modifications to current practices. The Company's approach emphasizes maintaining operational flexibility while meeting minimum legal requirements.

**Immediate Priorities:**
- Establish baseline documentation of current practices
- Identify potential areas of regulatory exposure
- Develop contingency plans for various compliance scenarios
- Maintain cost-effective operations pending regulatory clarification

## IX. EFFECTIVE DATE AND COMPLIANCE

This policy becomes effective immediately upon receipt. All subsidiary managers must acknowledge receipt within ten (10) days and confirm implementation within sixty (60) days.

Questions regarding interpretation or implementation should be directed to Corporate Legal Department at the New York headquarters.
