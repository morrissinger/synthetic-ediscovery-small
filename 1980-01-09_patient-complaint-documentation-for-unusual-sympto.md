# PATIENT COMPLAINT DOCUMENTATION FOR UNUSUAL SYMPTOMS

**TO:** Medical Records Department  
**FROM:** Dr. Patricia Williams, M.D.  
**DATE:** January 9, 1980  
**RE:** Unusual Pattern of Symptoms in East Woburn Pediatric Patients

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents an alarming pattern of unusual symptoms and diagnoses observed in pediatric patients residing in the East Woburn area, particularly those living in neighborhoods served by municipal Wells G and H. Over the past eighteen months, our practice has recorded a statistically significant increase in specific health complaints among children from this geographic region, warranting immediate documentation and potential investigation by appropriate health authorities.

## PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

Between June 1978 and December 1979, Woburn Family Medicine has treated 47 pediatric patients (ages 2-16) presenting with various combinations of symptoms including persistent fatigue, recurrent infections, unexplained bruising, and gastrointestinal complaints. Of these patients, 34 (72.3%) reside in the Pine Street, Salem Street, and East Woburn neighborhoods primarily served by Wells G and H water supply.

The geographic clustering is particularly pronounced in the following areas:
- Pine Street corridor: 12 cases
- Salem Street vicinity: 8 cases  
- East Woburn residential area: 14 cases
- Other Woburn neighborhoods: 13 cases

## SYMPTOM PATTERNS AND CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS

The most frequently reported symptoms among the East Woburn pediatric population include:

**Hematological Symptoms (68% of East Woburn cases):**
- Persistent fatigue and weakness
- Unexplained bruising and petechial rashes
- Recurrent nosebleeds
- Pallor and general malaise

**Gastrointestinal Complaints (45% of cases):**
- Chronic nausea and vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Abdominal pain
- Diarrhea

**Immunological Concerns (52% of cases):**
- Frequent upper respiratory infections
- Slow healing of minor wounds
- Recurrent fever episodes
- Swollen lymph nodes

**Neurological Symptoms (23% of cases):**
- Headaches
- Difficulty concentrating
- Behavioral changes

## SPECIFIC CASE DOCUMENTATION

Several cases warrant particular attention due to severity and progression:

**Case #1:** James Anderson, age 3, residing at Pine Street. Initial presentation June 1978 with persistent fatigue and bruising. Subsequent visits documented progressive symptoms including recurrent infections and failure to thrive. Parents report exclusive use of municipal water supply.

**Case #2:** Kevin Kane Jr., age 7, Salem Street area. Presented August 1978 with gastrointestinal complaints and unexplained weight loss. Follow-up examinations revealed enlarged spleen and abnormal blood work requiring referral to pediatric hematology.

**Case #3:** Michael Zona, age 5, East Woburn. Multiple visits beginning September 1978 for recurrent respiratory infections and persistent fatigue. Family history negative for immunodeficiency disorders.

## LABORATORY FINDINGS

Blood work performed on 28 of the East Woburn patients reveals concerning patterns:

- Decreased white blood cell counts in 64% of tested patients
- Abnormal platelet counts in 43% of cases
- Elevated liver enzymes in 32% of patients
- Anemia present in 57% of tested children

These laboratory abnormalities occur at rates significantly higher than typically observed in our general pediatric population.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

Of particular concern is the temporal correlation between symptom onset and the operational period of Wells G and H, which have supplied water to East Woburn since 1964 and 1966 respectively. Parents of affected children consistently report exclusive or primary use of municipal tap water for drinking, cooking, and bathing.

Several families have noted unusual taste and odor characteristics in their tap water, describing it as having a "chemical" or "metallic" taste, particularly during summer months. Multiple parents report that children have complained about the taste of the water and have requested bottled alternatives.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on these observations, I recommend the following immediate actions:

1. **Comprehensive Health Survey:** The Massachusetts Department of Public Health should conduct a formal epidemiological investigation of the East Woburn area to determine if these symptoms represent a statistically significant cluster.

2. **Water Quality Assessment:** Municipal water supplies, particularly Wells G and H, should undergo comprehensive testing for chemical contaminants beyond standard bacterial screening.

3. **Patient Monitoring:** All identified cases should receive enhanced monitoring and follow-up care, with particular attention to hematological parameters.

4. **Community Notification:** If environmental contamination is suspected, affected families should be notified and provided with alternative water sources pending investigation results.

5. **Medical Records Coordination:** All area physicians should be alerted to document similar symptom patterns and coordinate reporting through the Department of Public Health.

## CONCLUSION

The clustering of unusual symptoms in East Woburn pediatric patients, combined with the geographic concentration in areas served by Wells G and H, suggests a possible environmental health hazard requiring immediate investigation. The consistent laboratory abnormalities and symptom patterns observed in these children represent a significant departure from normal pediatric health metrics in our practice.

Given the potential severity of the underlying cause and the vulnerable population involved, I strongly urge immediate coordination with state health authorities and environmental agencies to determine the source of these health problems and implement appropriate protective measures for affected families.

This documentation is being forwarded to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and will be made available to any investigating authorities as requested.
