# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Harold J. Brennan, Operations Manager  
**FROM:** Robert P. Mitchell, Plant Supervisor  
**DATE:** August 3, 1964  
**RE:** Internal Authorization for Chemical Solvent Purchase Request

Harold,

I am submitting this memo to request formal authorization for the purchase of additional chemical solvents required for our expanded production operations at the Woburn facility. As you are aware, our manufacturing output has increased substantially since the opening of the new eastern production line in June, and our current inventory of cleaning and degreasing solvents is running critically low.

The specific materials we require include trichloroethylene (TCE) for metal degreasing operations, perchloroethylene (PCE) for precision cleaning of packaging machinery components, and methylene chloride for adhesive removal processes. Our engineering department has calculated that we will need approximately 2,400 gallons of TCE, 1,800 gallons of PCE, and 900 gallons of methylene chloride to maintain production schedules through the fourth quarter. These quantities represent standard industrial usage for a facility of our size and production capacity.

I have obtained preliminary quotes from three suppliers: Allied Chemical Corporation ($0.47 per gallon for TCE, $0.52 for PCE), Dow Chemical Company ($0.49 per gallon for TCE, $0.54 for PCE), and Union Carbide Corporation ($0.48 per gallon for TCE, $0.53 for PCE). All suppliers can guarantee delivery within two weeks of order placement. The methylene chloride is available from Allied at $0.61 per gallon. Total estimated cost for the complete solvent purchase is $2,847.

Our current storage capacity in the main chemical storage area can accommodate these volumes, and our maintenance crew has confirmed that all containment systems are functioning properly. The materials will be stored in accordance with standard industrial practices, with appropriate ventilation and fire suppression systems in place. I recommend we proceed with Allied Chemical Corporation as our primary supplier given their competitive pricing and established delivery record with our facility.

Please advise on approval so we can maintain uninterrupted production operations.
