# Annual Chemical Procurement and Disposal Budget Analysis

**Prepared by:** Cryovac Finance Department  
**Date:** November 7, 1972  
**Report Period:** Fiscal Year 1972  
**Distribution:** W.R. Grace Corporate Finance, Cryovac Operations Management

## Executive Summary

This report presents the annual analysis of chemical procurement and disposal expenditures for the Cryovac Division's Woburn facility for fiscal year 1972. Total chemical procurement costs increased 12.3% over the previous year to $847,600, while disposal costs remained relatively stable at $23,400, representing 2.8% of total chemical expenditures.

The facility continues to maintain cost-effective operations through strategic procurement partnerships and efficient disposal methodologies. Current disposal practices leverage both on-site treatment capabilities and approved third-party contractors to manage industrial waste streams in compliance with applicable regulations.

## Chemical Procurement Analysis

### Primary Solvent Purchases

The facility's primary solvent requirements for manufacturing operations totaled $623,200 in fiscal year 1972, representing 73.5% of total chemical procurement. Key purchases included:

- **Trichloroethylene (TCE)**: 145,000 gallons at $2.85/gallon = $413,250
- **Perchloroethylene (PCE)**: 38,000 gallons at $3.20/gallon = $121,600  
- **1,1,1-Trichloroethane**: 22,000 gallons at $2.95/gallon = $64,900
- **Methylene Chloride**: 8,500 gallons at $2.74/gallon = $23,290

The increase in TCE procurement reflects expanded production capacity and improved degreasing efficiency requirements. Our primary supplier, Hooker Chemical Corporation, has maintained stable pricing despite market volatility in the chlorinated solvent sector.

### Secondary Chemical Requirements

Supporting chemical purchases totaled $224,400 and included cleaning agents, processing additives, and maintenance chemicals. Notable categories:

- **Caustic cleaning solutions**: $78,600
- **Metal treatment chemicals**: $52,800
- **Process stabilizers and additives**: $93,000

## Disposal Cost Analysis

### Current Disposal Methods

The facility employs a multi-tier approach to chemical waste management that has proven both cost-effective and operationally efficient:

**On-Site Treatment (67% of waste volume)**
- Neutralization tanks for acid/base waste streams
- Solvent recovery through distillation
- Evaporation ponds for dilute aqueous waste
- Cost: $8,200 annually (maintenance and utilities)

**Third-Party Contractors (28% of waste volume)**
- John J. Riley Company for concentrated solvent waste
- Regional disposal services for miscellaneous chemicals
- Cost: $12,400 annually

**Direct Discharge (5% of waste volume)**
- Treated process water to municipal system
- Storm water runoff management
- Cost: $2,800 annually (permit fees and monitoring)

### Disposal Volume Metrics

Total waste generation for fiscal year 1972:

- **Solvent waste**: 18,500 gallons (requiring off-site disposal or recovery)
- **Aqueous waste**: 145,000 gallons (treated on-site)
- **Solid waste**: 45 tons (general industrial waste)
- **Hazardous solid waste**: 12 tons (specialized disposal required)

The facility maintains a waste minimization ratio of 0.89 pounds of waste per pound of product manufactured, representing a 3% improvement over the previous fiscal year.

## Cost Optimization Opportunities

### Procurement Efficiencies

Analysis indicates potential savings through:

1. **Volume Purchase Agreements**: Negotiating annual contracts for TCE and PCE could reduce unit costs by 4-6%
2. **Alternative Suppliers**: Secondary sourcing for methylene chloride could achieve 8% cost reduction
3. **Inventory Management**: Optimizing storage capacity to leverage bulk purchasing discounts

### Disposal Efficiencies

Current disposal costs represent industry benchmarks, though several optimization opportunities exist:

1. **Enhanced Solvent Recovery**: Upgrading distillation equipment could increase recovery rates from 78% to 85%, reducing disposal volumes
2. **Waste Stream Segregation**: Improved separation of waste types could reduce specialized disposal requirements
3. **On-Site Treatment Expansion**: Additional neutralization capacity could handle increased production volumes without proportional disposal cost increases

## Regulatory Compliance Costs

The facility maintains full compliance with applicable federal and state environmental regulations. Compliance-related expenditures for fiscal year 1972 included:

- **Permit fees and renewals**: $3,600
- **Required monitoring and testing**: $8,900
- **Regulatory reporting and documentation**: $2,400
- **Staff training and certification**: $1,800

Total regulatory compliance costs of $16,700 represent 2.0% of total chemical-related expenditures, consistent with industry standards for facilities of comparable size and complexity.

## Forward-Looking Considerations

### Projected Requirements for Fiscal Year 1973

Based on current production forecasts and market conditions:

- **Chemical procurement**: Estimated increase of 8-10% due to expanded operations
- **Disposal costs**: Expected to remain stable with potential 5% increase due to regulatory changes
- **New compliance requirements**: Monitoring developments in federal environmental legislation

### Capital Investment Recommendations

To maintain cost competitiveness and operational efficiency, the following capital investments merit consideration:

1. **Solvent Recovery System Upgrade**: $75,000 investment could reduce annual disposal costs by $12,000-15,000
2. **Waste Treatment Expansion**: $45,000 expansion of neutralization capacity to handle projected growth
3. **Storage Infrastructure**: $25,000 investment in additional chemical storage to optimize procurement timing

## Conclusion

The Cryovac Division's chemical procurement and disposal operations continue to demonstrate effective cost management while maintaining full regulatory compliance. Current disposal practices represent industry best practices and provide operational flexibility to accommodate production variations.

The facility's integrated approach to waste management, combining on-site treatment, solvent recovery, and strategic third-party partnerships, positions the operation for continued cost-effective growth. Recommended capital investments would further enhance operational efficiency and provide additional cost optimization opportunities for future fiscal years.
