# WELLS G AND H WATER QUALITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

**CITY WATER COMMISSION**  
**WATER QUALITY DIVISION**

**Report No.:** WQA-77-0819-GH  
**Prepared by:** Robert M. Hartley, Senior Water Quality Technician  
**Date:** August 19, 1977  
**Report Period:** July 1977

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of routine water quality testing conducted on municipal Wells G and H during July 1977. Testing was performed in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines and EPA recommended procedures. While basic bacteriological and pH parameters remain within acceptable ranges, this assessment identifies several areas requiring continued monitoring and potential corrective action.

Wells G and H continue to serve as primary water sources for the East Woburn distribution system, providing approximately 2.8 million gallons per day to residential and commercial customers in the affected service area.

## WELL SPECIFICATIONS AND OPERATIONAL STATUS

### Well G
- **Location:** Pine Street Industrial Area
- **Depth:** 180 feet
- **Installation Date:** May 1964
- **Current Output:** 1,200 gallons per minute
- **Service Population:** Approximately 3,200 residents
- **Operational Status:** Active

### Well H
- **Location:** Adjacent to Well G, Pine Street corridor
- **Depth:** 165 feet
- **Installation Date:** September 1966
- **Current Output:** 1,100 gallons per minute
- **Service Population:** Approximately 2,900 residents
- **Operational Status:** Active

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected from both wells on July 12, 15, 22, and 29, 1977, using standard sterile collection procedures. All samples were transported to the City Laboratory within four hours of collection and analyzed within 24 hours. Testing protocols followed Massachusetts Department of Public Health Standard Operating Procedure WQ-101 (Revised March 1976).

**Parameters Tested:**
- Bacterial contamination (coliform count)
- pH levels
- Turbidity
- Chloride content
- Iron and manganese levels
- Taste and odor assessment
- Color evaluation

## ANALYTICAL RESULTS

### Bacteriological Analysis
Both wells demonstrated acceptable coliform counts throughout the testing period, with all samples showing zero colony-forming units per 100ml. This indicates absence of bacterial contamination and suggests adequate natural filtration through the aquifer system.

### Physical and Chemical Parameters

**Well G Results (July 1977 Average):**
- pH: 6.8 (within acceptable range 6.5-8.5)
- Turbidity: 2.1 NTU (acceptable, <5.0 NTU)
- Chloride: 42 mg/L (elevated from previous months)
- Iron: 0.8 mg/L (approaching secondary standard limit)
- Manganese: 0.3 mg/L (within acceptable range)
- Color: 15 units (acceptable, <20 units)

**Well H Results (July 1977 Average):**
- pH: 6.9 (within acceptable range)
- Turbidity: 1.8 NTU (acceptable)
- Chloride: 38 mg/L (elevated from previous months)
- Iron: 0.6 mg/L (acceptable)
- Manganese: 0.2 mg/L (acceptable)
- Color: 12 units (acceptable)

### Taste and Odor Evaluation
Consumer complaints regarding taste and odor have increased by approximately 15% compared to the same period in 1976. Field testing indicates occasional detection of chemical-like odors, particularly during morning hours when wells operate at peak capacity. The source of these odors has not been definitively identified, though industrial activities in the Pine Street corridor may contribute to these periodic occurrences.

## TRENDING ANALYSIS

Comparison with historical data from 1975-1976 reveals several concerning trends:

1. **Chloride Levels:** Both wells show steady increases in chloride content over the past 18 months. Well G has increased from 28 mg/L (January 1976) to current levels of 42 mg/L, representing a 50% increase. Well H has increased from 25 mg/L to 38 mg/L over the same period.

2. **Iron Content:** Well G iron levels have fluctuated between 0.6-0.9 mg/L throughout 1977, approaching the secondary drinking water standard of 1.0 mg/L. This represents a gradual increase from 0.4 mg/L recorded in early 1976.

3. **Consumer Complaints:** Documentation of taste and odor complaints has increased from an average of 2-3 per month in 1975 to current levels of 8-12 complaints per month, with peak complaints occurring during summer months when well production is highest.

## OBSERVATIONS AND CONCERNS

During routine maintenance inspections, several observations warrant attention:

- **Well Head Security:** Both wells maintain adequate physical security and proper casing integrity
- **Surrounding Land Use:** Continued industrial development in the Pine Street area has resulted in increased truck traffic and potential for surface contamination
- **Aquifer Characteristics:** The underlying aquifer system demonstrates good recharge capacity, though seasonal variations in water table levels affect production rates
- **Distribution System:** No evidence of contamination within the distribution network serving the East Woburn area

**Notable Incidents:**
On July 18, 1977, maintenance personnel observed discolored soil approximately 200 yards northeast of Well G during routine grounds inspection. Soil appeared darkened with an oily sheen, though no immediate connection to well water quality was established. Area was photographed and documented for future reference.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Both wells currently meet all applicable Massachusetts Department of Public Health drinking water standards as established in regulation 105 CMR 410.000. All required testing frequencies have been maintained, and proper documentation procedures followed throughout the reporting period.

**Required Testing Schedule Compliance:**
- Monthly bacteriological testing: 100% compliance
- Quarterly chemical analysis: 100% compliance
- Annual comprehensive testing: Scheduled for October 1977

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the analytical results and trending data, the following recommendations are submitted for Water Commission Board consideration:

### Immediate Actions (30 days)
1. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase chloride testing frequency to bi-weekly for both wells to establish more precise trending data
2. **Source Investigation:** Conduct field survey of industrial facilities within 1,000-foot radius of wells to identify potential contamination sources
3. **Consumer Response:** Develop standardized response procedures for taste and odor complaints, including follow-up testing protocols

### Short-term Actions (90 days)
1. **Iron Treatment:** Evaluate installation of iron removal equipment for Well G if levels continue to approach secondary standards
2. **Well Head Protection:** Establish formal well head protection zones consistent with state recommendations
3. **Alternative Sources:** Begin preliminary evaluation of additional well locations to reduce dependence on Wells G and H

### Long-term Considerations (1-2 years)
1. **Comprehensive Aquifer Study:** Commission hydrogeological assessment of the entire East Woburn aquifer system to better understand contamination pathways and protection requirements
2. **Treatment Facility Upgrade:** Evaluate centralized treatment options for taste and odor control
3. **Regulatory Coordination:** Establish formal communication protocols with Massachusetts Department of Public Health and EPA regarding ongoing monitoring requirements

## CONCLUSION

Wells G and H continue to provide bacteriologically safe drinking water to East Woburn residents. However, the upward trends in chemical parameters and increasing consumer complaints indicate the need for enhanced monitoring and proactive management strategies. The Water Commission should consider implementing the recommended actions to ensure continued compliance with drinking water standards and maintenance of consumer confidence in the municipal water supply.

The proximity of industrial activities to these critical water sources necessitates ongoing vigilance and coordination with local regulatory authorities to protect this vital community resource. Regular assessment and prompt response to changing conditions will be essential to maintaining water quality standards as industrial development in the Pine Street corridor continues.
