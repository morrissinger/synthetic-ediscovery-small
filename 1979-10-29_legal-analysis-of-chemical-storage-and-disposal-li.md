**RE: Legal Analysis of Chemical Storage and Disposal Liability at Riley Property - East Woburn, Massachusetts**

Gentlemen:

This letter provides my preliminary legal analysis of potential corporate liability arising from chemical storage and disposal activities at the John J. Riley Company tannery property located at 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts, which has been owned by Beatrice Foods Inc. since the company's acquisition of Riley operations in 1978. This analysis has been prepared in response to recent developments concerning municipal well contamination in East Woburn and the subsequent closure of Wells G and H by Massachusetts health authorities in May 1979.

## Background and Current Situation

As you are aware, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health ordered the immediate closure of municipal Wells G and H in East Woburn following the detection of volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethylene, in concentrations exceeding acceptable standards for potable water supply. These wells, which had operated since 1964 and 1966 respectively, provided water service to residential neighborhoods in eastern Woburn, including areas where several cases of childhood leukemia have been reported over the past five years.

The Riley tannery property, which Beatrice Foods acquired as part of the Riley Company purchase, encompasses both the active tanning operations at 228 Salem Street and an adjacent 14.73-acre undeveloped parcel. Historical records indicate that this property has been used for leather processing and related industrial activities since the early 1900s, with various chemical substances utilized in the tanning process including chromium compounds, sulfuric acid, and organic solvents. Of particular concern are disposal practices that may have occurred on the undeveloped portion of the property, which is located in proximity to the groundwater sources that fed the contaminated municipal wells.

## Legal Exposure Analysis

Based on my review of Massachusetts environmental and tort law, Beatrice Foods faces potential liability exposure under several legal theories:

### 1. Negligence Claims

Under Massachusetts law, property owners have a duty to exercise reasonable care in the storage, use, and disposal of hazardous substances to prevent harm to neighboring properties and the general public. The doctrine of negligence would require plaintiffs to establish: (a) that Beatrice Foods, as successor owner to Riley Company operations, owed a duty of care to residents served by the contaminated wells; (b) that this duty was breached through improper chemical disposal practices; (c) that such breach was the proximate cause of water contamination; and (d) that damages resulted from exposure to contaminated water.

The challenge for potential plaintiffs lies in establishing the causal connection between disposal activities on the Riley property and the specific contamination detected in Wells G and H. However, the geographic proximity of the Riley property to the wells, combined with documented use of trichloroethylene and other solvents in tanning operations, creates a factual foundation that could support negligence claims. Massachusetts courts have recognized that groundwater contamination cases may involve complex hydrogeological evidence, but have not established insurmountable barriers to recovery where industrial activities have contributed to environmental contamination.

### 2. Nuisance Liability

Both private and public nuisance theories present significant exposure for Beatrice Foods. Private nuisance claims could be brought by individual property owners whose wells or property values have been affected by groundwater contamination. Public nuisance claims might be pursued by municipal authorities seeking to recover costs associated with well closure, alternative water supply provision, and public health response measures.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that activities constituting an unreasonable interference with public health, safety, or welfare may give rise to public nuisance liability, even where such activities were conducted in accordance with then-prevailing industrial practices. The contamination of a municipal water supply serving hundreds of families would likely satisfy the "unreasonable interference" standard, particularly given the potential health implications of trichloroethylene exposure.

### 3. Wrongful Death and Personal Injury Claims

The most serious potential liability exposure relates to claims that chemical exposure through contaminated drinking water caused or contributed to serious illness or death, particularly the childhood leukemia cases that have been reported in the affected neighborhoods. While the scientific literature regarding trichloroethylene exposure and leukemia causation continues to evolve, there is growing medical evidence suggesting potential carcinogenic properties of certain chlorinated solvents.

Massachusetts wrongful death statutes permit recovery of damages for conscious pain and suffering, medical expenses, and loss of earning capacity. In cases involving children, while economic damages may be limited, the emotional distress and loss of consortium claims by surviving family members could result in substantial verdicts. Moreover, if a pattern of multiple childhood leukemia cases can be statistically linked to water contamination, the aggregate exposure could be severe.

### 4. Successor Liability Considerations

A critical issue for Beatrice Foods is the extent to which the company may be held liable for disposal practices that occurred prior to its acquisition of the Riley Company. Under Massachusetts law, successor corporations generally assume the liabilities of predecessor companies in asset acquisition transactions, particularly where the successor continues the same business operations at the same location.

The fact that Beatrice Foods acquired Riley Company operations and continued tanning activities at the Salem Street facility strengthens the argument for successor liability. Additionally, if Beatrice Foods had actual or constructive knowledge of prior disposal practices at the time of acquisition, this could support claims that the company assumed responsibility for environmental remediation and public safety.

## Strategic Recommendations

Given the potential magnitude of exposure and the developing nature of environmental tort law in Massachusetts, I recommend the following immediate actions:

**1. Comprehensive Site Investigation**: Retain qualified environmental consultants to conduct soil and groundwater testing on the Riley property to determine the extent and nature of any contamination. This investigation should be conducted under attorney-client privilege to protect against disclosure in potential litigation.

**2. Insurance Coverage Review**: Examine all applicable general liability and environmental insurance policies to determine coverage for cleanup costs and third-party claims. Early notification to carriers may be advisable to preserve coverage rights.

**3. Document Preservation**: Implement litigation hold procedures to preserve all documents relating to chemical use, storage, and disposal at the Riley facility, including records from predecessor Riley Company operations.

**4. Regulatory Compliance**: Coordinate with Massachusetts environmental authorities to ensure compliance with any investigation or remediation requirements. Voluntary cooperation may help establish good faith efforts to address contamination issues.

**5. Settlement Considerations**: Given the potential for substantial jury verdicts in wrongful death cases involving children, early evaluation of settlement opportunities may be prudent if claims are filed.

## Conclusion

The closure of Wells G and H and the reported childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn present serious legal and financial risks for Beatrice Foods. While causation issues may provide some defense against individual claims, the aggregate exposure from multiple potential plaintiffs, combined with regulatory cleanup costs and public relations concerns, creates substantial corporate risk.

The evolving nature of environmental tort law suggests that courts may be increasingly receptive to claims involving groundwater contamination and public health impacts. Beatrice Foods should prepare for the possibility of significant litigation and consider proactive measures to address both legal exposure and community relations concerns.
