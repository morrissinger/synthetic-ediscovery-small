# Letter of Condolence

March 25, 1981

Dear Richard and Mary,

On behalf of the Woburn Neighbors Association and the many families throughout our community, we extend our deepest sympathy to you and your family during this most difficult time. The loss of Patrick has touched all of our hearts, and we want you to know that you are not alone in your grief.

Patrick was such a bright light in our neighborhood. Many of us remember his smile when he would ride his bicycle down the street, always stopping to pet the dogs and say hello to neighbors working in their yards. Mrs. Henderson from Montvale Avenue told us just yesterday how Patrick would help her carry her groceries from the car, never accepting so much as a penny for his kindness. The Kowalski family on Salem Street shared how Patrick would include their shy youngest daughter in games with the other children, making sure no one was left out. These are the memories we will carry with us—of a boy who brought joy and compassion to everyone he met.

We know that Patrick fought his illness with tremendous courage over these past years. As parents ourselves, we cannot begin to imagine the strength it took for your family to face each day, each treatment, each hospital stay with such grace and determination. Your devotion to Patrick throughout his battle has been an inspiration to all of us who have watched from afar, wishing we could do more to help. We have seen how you never gave up hope, how you made sure Patrick's childhood was filled with as much normalcy and happiness as possible despite the circumstances beyond anyone's control.

The tragedy that has befallen your family—and the Anderson family before you—has shaken our entire community to its core. We are beginning to understand that what happened to Patrick and to young James Anderson may not have been simply a cruel twist of fate. Many of us are asking difficult questions about our water, our neighborhood, and whether our children have been exposed to dangers we never knew existed. While nothing can bring back our precious children, we are committed to finding answers and ensuring that no other family has to endure what you have endured.

We want you to know that the Woburn Neighbors Association is organizing to support families like yours who have been affected by these terrible circumstances. We are working with other concerned parents to document what has happened in our community and to seek help from health authorities. Mrs. Anderson has been particularly active in reaching out to families, and we believe that together we may be able to find the truth about what has caused these illnesses among our children.

In the coming weeks and months, please know that we are here for you in whatever way you need. Several neighbors have already volunteered to help with meals, errands, or simply to provide a listening ear when you need one. Mrs. O'Brien from Cross Street has organized a schedule of families who would like to bring dinner to your home over the next two weeks—please don't hesitate to accept this small gesture of support. The Murphys on Montvale Avenue have offered to help with yard work or household tasks, and the Rodriguezes would be happy to assist with any shopping or appointments you might need help with.

We also want to assure you that Patrick's memory will live on in our community. The children in the neighborhood have asked if they could plant a tree in his honor at the small park on Salem Street where he loved to play. We think this would be a beautiful way to remember him and to give the children a place where they can feel close to their friend. If this idea brings you comfort, we would love to move forward with it when you feel ready.

Please take all the time you need to grieve and to heal as a family. We understand that the pain you are feeling cannot be measured or rushed, and we want you to know that our support is not temporary—we are your neighbors and friends for the long term. Whether you need help with practical matters, someone to talk to, or simply the knowledge that others care about you and Patrick, we are here.

Our children are asking questions we don't know how to answer. They want to understand why Patrick got sick, why he couldn't get better, and whether they might get sick too. We are trying to be honest with them while also providing comfort and reassurance. What we can tell them with certainty is that Patrick was loved by many people, that he made a difference in the lives of everyone who knew him, and that his family has the support of the entire community as they face the days ahead.

We hope that in time, when the sharpest pain has softened into cherished memories, you will find some measure of peace. Patrick's life, though far too brief, was filled with love and brought happiness to so many people. He will not be forgotten by any of us who had the privilege of knowing him.

With our deepest condolences and continued support,

**The Woburn Neighbors Association**
