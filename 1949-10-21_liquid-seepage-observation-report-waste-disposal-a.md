## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents observations of liquid seepage from the primary waste disposal area located on the southwestern section of the tannery property. The seepage was first noticed during routine morning inspection of the facility grounds and appears to originate from the main chemical waste pit established in 1932 for disposal of spent tanning solutions and process water.

## LOCATION DESCRIPTION

The affected area is situated approximately 200 yards southwest of the main tanning building, between the railroad embankment and the natural depression that leads toward the Aberjona River. The waste disposal pit measures approximately 40 feet by 60 feet and has been excavated to a depth of 8 feet below ground level. The pit has served as the primary repository for liquid waste from our chrome tanning operations, including spent chromium sulfate solutions, vegetable tanning extracts, and process water containing dissolved salts and organic matter.

## DETAILED OBSERVATIONS

### Visual Assessment

Upon arrival at the site at approximately 09:15 AM, I observed a dark-colored liquid emanating from the southeastern corner of the waste pit. The liquid appeared to be seeping through the earthen walls of the pit and flowing in a generally eastward direction toward the natural drainage that connects to the Aberjona River system. The seepage created a visible wet area extending approximately 25 feet from the pit edge, with the liquid following the natural grade of the land.

The color of the seeping liquid was dark brown to black, consistent with the chromium-based tanning solutions we have been disposing of in this location for the past seventeen years. There was a noticeable chemical odor, similar to the smell present in our tanning vats, which was detectable from a distance of approximately 10 feet downwind.

### Soil Conditions

The soil immediately surrounding the seepage area showed signs of saturation and discoloration. The normally light brown sandy loam characteristic of our property had taken on a darker hue, particularly in areas where the liquid had been in contact with the ground for what appeared to be an extended period. The affected soil felt different to the touch—more slippery and with a slightly oily texture compared to unaffected areas nearby.

### Flow Pattern Analysis

The seepage followed a consistent eastward flow pattern, taking advantage of the natural depression in the land that leads toward the Aberjona River. I estimated the flow rate at approximately one to two gallons per hour based on the wet area expansion observed during my thirty-minute inspection period. The liquid appeared to be accumulating in the lower portions of the drainage channel, creating small pools in natural depressions along the flow path.

## PROBABLE CAUSES

Based on my fifteen years of experience with tannery operations and familiarity with this disposal site, I believe the seepage results from several contributing factors:

### Pit Capacity Issues

The waste disposal pit has been in continuous use since 1932 and may have reached or exceeded its intended capacity. Recent increases in production, particularly our expanded chrome tanning operations to meet post-war demand, have resulted in greater volumes of liquid waste requiring disposal.

### Seasonal Groundwater Conditions

The recent period of heavy autumn rains may have elevated groundwater levels in the area, potentially creating hydraulic pressure that forces waste liquids through the earthen walls of the pit. The sandy soil conditions prevalent in this section of our property may not provide adequate containment during periods of high groundwater.

### Pit Wall Integrity

After seventeen years of continuous use, the earthen walls of the disposal pit may have experienced degradation due to chemical exposure. The chromium sulfate and other tanning chemicals disposed of in this location are known to be corrosive and may have compromised the structural integrity of the pit walls over time.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

Upon discovering the seepage, I implemented the following immediate measures:

1. **Area Isolation**: Placed wooden barriers around the affected area to prevent foot traffic and equipment operation in the contaminated zone.

2. **Documentation**: Photographed the seepage area using the company Kodak camera for record-keeping purposes.

3. **Notification**: Immediately reported the situation to Mr. Riley and requested guidance on remedial actions.

4. **Monitoring**: Established a schedule for twice-daily inspection of the seepage area to track any changes in flow rate or affected area size.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Short-Term Actions

**Immediate Containment**: Construct a temporary earthen berm along the eastern edge of the affected area to redirect seepage flow away from the natural drainage leading to the Aberjona River. This measure should be implemented within 24-48 hours to prevent further migration of waste liquids.

**Alternative Disposal**: Temporarily redirect liquid waste to the secondary disposal area located near the northern property boundary until the primary pit can be properly addressed.

**Increased Monitoring**: Implement daily inspection of all waste disposal areas to identify potential problems before they result in off-site migration of waste materials.

### Long-Term Solutions

**Pit Rehabilitation**: Consider excavating the existing pit to greater depth and installing clay lining or other impermeable barrier to prevent future seepage. This work should be scheduled during the winter months when production levels are typically lower.

**Waste Volume Reduction**: Investigate opportunities to reduce the volume of liquid waste requiring disposal through process modifications or recovery of valuable chemicals from spent solutions.

**Additional Disposal Capacity**: Evaluate the need for construction of additional waste disposal facilities to handle increased production volumes without exceeding the capacity of existing infrastructure.

## REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

While current Massachusetts regulations do not specifically address industrial waste disposal practices, prudent management suggests minimizing any potential for waste materials to migrate beyond our property boundaries. The proximity of the Aberjona River and the possibility of future residential development in the area make containment of our waste materials a priority for continued operations.

## CONCLUSION

The observed liquid seepage represents a manageable operational issue that requires prompt attention to prevent potential complications. The seepage appears to be related to capacity limitations and seasonal groundwater conditions rather than any fundamental flaw in our waste management approach. Implementation of the recommended short-term containment measures should address the immediate concern while allowing time for planning of longer-term improvements to our waste disposal infrastructure.

I recommend scheduling a meeting with Mr. Riley within the next 48 hours to discuss implementation of these recommendations and allocation of necessary resources for remedial actions.
