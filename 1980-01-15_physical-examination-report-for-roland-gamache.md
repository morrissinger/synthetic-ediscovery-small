**Abdominal:**
Soft, non-distended, mild splenomegaly palpated 2 cm below left costal margin, liver edge palpable 1 cm below right costal margin

**Musculoskeletal:**
Normal range of motion, no joint swelling or tenderness

Multiple ecchymoses noted on bilateral lower extremities and arms in various stages of healing, ranging from fresh (dark purple) to resolving (yellow-green). No petechiae observed. Pallor noted throughout.

**Neurological:**
Alert and oriented, appropriate for age, no focal deficits

## LABORATORY RESULTS (Drawn 1/15/80)

**Complete Blood Count:**
- White Blood Cell Count: 15,200/μL (elevated) (Normal: 4,500-11,000/μL)
- Red Blood Cell Count: 2.8 million/μL (decreased) (Normal: 4.0-5.2 million/μL)
- Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL (severely decreased) (Normal: 11.5-14.5 g/dL)
- Hematocrit: 21% (decreased) (Normal: 35-45%)
- Platelet Count: 45,000/μL (severely decreased) (Normal: 150,000-450,000/μL)

**Blood Chemistry:**
- Glucose: 88 mg/dL (normal)
- BUN: 18 mg/dL (normal)
- Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL (normal)
- Total Protein: 6.2 g/dL (normal)
- Albumin: 3.8 g/dL (normal)

**Peripheral Blood Smear:**
Numerous immature white blood cells (blasts) observed, comprising approximately 30% of white cell population. Red blood cells show hypochromic, microcytic morphology. Platelet count confirmed to be markedly decreased.

## ASSESSMENT AND CLINICAL IMPRESSION

**Primary Diagnosis:**
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) - highly suspected based on:
1. Clinical presentation of fatigue, fever, and easy bruising
2. Physical findings of hepatosplenomegaly and pallor
3. Laboratory findings showing pancytopenia with circulating blasts
4. Age and demographic profile consistent with pediatric ALL

**Secondary Considerations:**
- Severe anemia secondary to bone marrow infiltration
- Thrombocytopenia with bleeding risk
- Immunosuppression secondary to leukemic process

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Urgent Hematology/Oncology Consultation** - Referral to Children's Hospital Boston for specialized pediatric oncology evaluation
2. **Bone Marrow Biopsy** - To confirm diagnosis and determine specific leukemia subtype
3. **Additional Laboratory Studies:**
   - Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
   - Uric acid level
   - Liver function tests
   - Coagulation studies (PT/PTT)
   - Blood type and crossmatch

**Patient Care Instructions:**
1. **Activity Restriction** - No contact sports or activities with bleeding risk due to low platelet count
2. **Infection Precautions** - Avoid crowded areas, report fever >100.4°F immediately
3. **Bleeding Precautions** - Soft toothbrush, avoid aspirin or NSAIDs
4. **Nutritional Support** - High-calorie, high-protein diet as tolerated

**Follow-up:**
- Immediate referral to pediatric oncology within 24-48 hours
- Emergency department instructions provided for fever, bleeding, or respiratory distress
- Return to clinic in 2-3 days for laboratory monitoring if oncology consultation delayed

**Prognosis Discussion:**
Preliminary discussion held with parents regarding suspected diagnosis. Emphasized need for immediate specialist consultation and that treatment options for pediatric leukemia have improved significantly in recent years. Provided emotional support and hospital social services contact information.

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

Patient's residence in East Woburn area noted. Family reports exclusive use of municipal water supply since 1975. Recent community concerns regarding water quality have been reported in local media. Recommend documentation of residential history and water source for potential epidemiological investigation if indicated by public health authorities.

**Plan for Communication:**
1. Immediate phone consultation with Dr. Sarah
