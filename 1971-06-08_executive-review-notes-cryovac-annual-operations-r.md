# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Executive Committee Files  
**FROM:** Corporate Operations Review  
**DATE:** June 8, 1971  
**RE:** Executive Review Notes - Cryovac Annual Operations Report

## Summary of Operations Review

Following my review of the Cryovac Division annual operations report for fiscal year 1970, several key operational matters require executive attention and potential policy guidance. The Woburn facility continues to demonstrate strong production metrics and cost efficiency measures that align with corporate objectives for the packaging materials sector.

Production volumes at the Woburn plant have increased 18% year-over-year, with particular strength in our industrial shrink-wrap applications and food packaging lines. The facility's strategic location in the Boston metropolitan area continues to provide advantageous access to both raw materials and distribution networks. Plant management has successfully implemented the cost reduction initiatives outlined in last year's strategic planning sessions, resulting in a 12% improvement in per-unit manufacturing costs.

## Operational Efficiency and Waste Management

The Woburn facility has maintained its focus on operational efficiency through streamlined solvent recovery processes and optimized production scheduling. Current waste disposal protocols follow established industry standards for chemical manufacturing operations. The facility's waste stream management includes appropriate handling of trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene used in cleaning and degreasing operations, with disposal arrangements through qualified contractors who transport materials to approved sites.

Plant engineering reports indicate that current disposal methods are cost-effective and meet applicable regulatory requirements. The facility's proximity to suitable disposal areas has helped maintain competitive operational costs while ensuring compliance with Massachusetts environmental guidelines. Recent discussions with plant management confirm that waste handling procedures are being conducted in accordance with standard industrial practices for chemical manufacturing facilities.

## Regulatory Environment and Compliance

The current regulatory environment for chemical manufacturing operations remains stable, with no significant changes anticipated in Massachusetts or federal oversight requirements. Plant management continues to maintain appropriate documentation of waste disposal activities and solvent usage in accordance with standard industry practices. The facility's environmental compliance record remains satisfactory, with no outstanding regulatory concerns identified during the review period.

Given the facility's strong operational performance and continued growth potential in the packaging materials market, I recommend maintaining current operational protocols and disposal procedures. The Woburn plant represents a valuable asset in our manufacturing portfolio and should continue to receive appropriate capital allocation for equipment maintenance and capacity optimization initiatives.
