## Interview Summary

### Initial Health Concerns and Timeline

Mrs. Anderson provided detailed chronology of her son James's health decline. She reported that James was a healthy, active child until approximately age 8 (1975), when he began experiencing recurring fatigue and frequent respiratory infections. Initial pediatric consultations attributed symptoms to typical childhood illnesses.

**Key Timeline Points Discussed:**
- **Summer 1975:** First notable fatigue episodes, decreased appetite
- **Fall 1975 - Spring 1976:** Recurring upper respiratory infections, persistent cough
- **Summer 1976:** Noticeable pallor, easy bruising observed by parents
- **September 1976:** First blood work ordered by Dr. Patricia Williams, Woburn Pediatric Associates
- **October 1976:** Abnormal blood count results, referral to Massachusetts General Hospital
- **November 1976:** Initial leukemia diagnosis confirmed at MGH
- **January 1980:** Death following complications from treatment

### Environmental Factors and Water Consumption

Mrs. Anderson confirmed that the family relied exclusively on municipal water supply from 1967 through May 1979. She noted several observations regarding water quality:

1. **Taste and Odor Issues:** Beginning approximately 1973-1974, family noticed occasional "chemical" or "sweet" taste in tap water, particularly during summer months
2. **Water Usage Patterns:** James consumed significant quantities of tap water, particularly during summer activities and sports participation
3. **Cooking and Food Preparation:** All cooking, beverage preparation, and infant formula (for younger siblings) prepared using municipal tap water
4. **Well Water Switch:** Family began using bottled water for drinking in June 1979 following community notices about well closures

### Neighborhood Health Observations

Mrs. Anderson reported awareness of other childhood illnesses in immediate neighborhood:

- **Kane Family (38 Meadowbrook Road):** Kevin Kane Jr. diagnosed with leukemia approximately 1976
- **Zona Family (Pine Street area):** Michael Zona diagnosed with leukemia, approximate timeframe 1977-1978
- **General Observations:** Noted increased frequency of childhood respiratory illnesses, skin conditions among neighborhood children during mid-1970s period

### Medical Treatment and Documentation

Mr. and Mrs. Anderson provided access to medical records spanning James's illness period. Key documentation includes:

1. **Pediatric Records:** Complete files from Woburn Pediatric Associates (1967-1976)
2. **Hospital Records:** Massachusetts General Hospital oncology records (1976-1980)
3. **Treatment Documentation:** Chemotherapy protocols, blood work results, progress notes
4. **Death Certificate:** Commonwealth of Massachusetts certificate listing acute lymphocytic leukemia as primary cause of death

## Investigator Observations and Findings

### Physical Environment Assessment

**Property Characteristics:**
- Single-family residence constructed 1965
- Municipal water connection installed 1967
- Property located approximately 0.8 miles southeast of Wells G and H
- No private wells or alternative water sources on property
- Standard residential plumbing, no unusual fixtures or modifications noted

**Geographic Factors:**
- Property elevation approximately 15 feet above Aberjona River level
- Groundwater flow direction consistent with contamination pathway from industrial sources
- Soil composition: Sandy loam over glacial till, consistent with regional geology

### Documentation Review

Medical records provided by Anderson family demonstrate clear progression of acute lymphocytic leukemia with onset during period of exposure to contaminated municipal water supply. Treatment protocols followed standard pediatric oncology practices of the period. No family history of leukemia or other hematologic malignancies identified.

### Correlation with Ongoing Investigation

Anderson case demonstrates several factors consistent with other identified cases in East Woburn cluster:

1. **Geographic Concentration:** Residence within 1-mile radius of Wells G and H
2. **Temporal Pattern:** Symptom onset during period of well operation (1964-1979)
3. **Age Demographics:** Childhood onset consistent with cluster characteristics
4. **Environmental Exposure:** Exclusive reliance on municipal water supply during critical exposure period

---

## Preliminary Conclusions

Based on interview findings and documentation review, the Anderson case presents strong evidence supporting potential causal relationship between contaminated municipal water supply and childhood leukemia incidence in East Woburn. Key supporting factors include:

1. **Temporal Correlation:** Symptom onset and disease progression occurred during period of documented water contamination from Wells G and H
2. **Geographic Correlation:** Residence location within identified cluster area served by contaminated wells
3. **Exposure Documentation:** Confirmed high-level consumption of municipal water during critical developmental period
4. **Medical Documentation:** Complete medical records supporting leukemia diagnosis and treatment timeline

---

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Medical Record Analysis:** Comprehensive review of all available medical documentation for James Anderson case with pediatric oncology specialist consultation
2. **Environmental Sampling:** Soil and groundwater testing at Anderson property to determine extent of contamination migration
3. **Epidemiological Analysis:** Statistical analysis of Anderson case within broader East Woburn cluster investigation
4. **Legal Documentation:** Preservation of all medical records, interview notes, and environmental data for potential legal proceedings
