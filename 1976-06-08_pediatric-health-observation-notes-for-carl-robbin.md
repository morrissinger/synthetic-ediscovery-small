# Health Observation Record
**Patient:** Carl Robbins III  
**Date:** June 8, 1976  
**Observer:** Donna Robbins (Mother)  
**Time:** 8:15 AM  

## Current Status and Symptoms

Carl has been experiencing another difficult night with recurring fever and severe fatigue. His temperature reached 101.2°F at approximately 2:30 AM, requiring cold compresses and aspirin. The fever broke around 5:00 AM, but he remains extremely pale and listless this morning. Dark circles under his eyes have become more pronounced over the past two weeks.

Notable symptoms observed since last documentation (May 25, 1976):

- **Persistent bruising**: New bruises appearing on arms and legs without apparent cause. Three large bruises on left shin, two on right forearm, one on shoulder blade
- **Nosebleeds**: Fourth occurrence this week, lasting approximately 15 minutes yesterday evening
- **Loss of appetite**: Refusing most meals, only accepting small portions of soup and crackers
- **Extreme fatigue**: Unable to play outside with neighborhood children, requires afternoon naps
- **Joint pain**: Complaining of aches in knees and ankles, particularly in morning hours

## Physical Observations

Carl's complexion continues to concern me greatly. The pallor that first appeared in late April has worsened considerably. His lips appear almost colorless, and the skin around his fingernails has taken on a grayish tinge. When he does attempt to play, he becomes breathless within minutes—a stark contrast to his previous energy levels.

Weight loss is becoming apparent. His clothes are noticeably loose, and I estimate he has lost at least 8-10 pounds since his last doctor visit in March. His cheekbones are more prominent, and his usual robust appearance has given way to a gaunt, hollow look that frightens me.

The lymph nodes in his neck feel swollen when I check them during his evening routine. They seem larger than they were two weeks ago, though Carl doesn't complain when I examine them gently.

## Behavioral Changes

Carl's personality has changed dramatically since the spring. Previously an active, cheerful child who loved playing baseball with the other boys on Montvale Road, he now prefers to stay indoors, often lying on the living room couch with his favorite blanket. He shows little interest in his model airplanes or comic books—activities that once captivated him for hours.

Sleep patterns have become erratic. He experiences night sweats that require changing his pajamas and bed linens, sometimes twice in one night. Despite his fatigue during the day, he often has difficulty falling asleep, complaining of feeling "uncomfortable" though he cannot articulate specific pain locations.

His appetite for favorite foods has vanished entirely. The chocolate chip cookies and peanut butter sandwiches he once devoured now sit untouched. Even ice cream, previously irresistible, fails to tempt him. This morning he managed only half a piece of toast and a few sips of orange juice.

## Environmental Context and Concerns

Living here on Montvale Road, I cannot help but notice the pattern emerging among our neighbors' children. The Zona family's tragedy with little Michael still haunts our entire neighborhood. Joan Zona and I have spoken several times about the similarities in our boys' symptoms before Michael's diagnosis. The fear that grips my heart grows stronger each day.

Our water has an increasingly strange taste and odor that seems to worsen during certain times of the day. The metallic, chemical smell is particularly noticeable in the morning when I first turn on the kitchen faucet. I have begun purchasing bottled water for Carl's consumption, though I realize this may be too little, too late if our suspicions about the municipal water supply prove correct.

The proximity of our home to the industrial areas east of our neighborhood weighs heavily on my mind. The chemical odors that occasionally drift through our windows, particularly on humid summer evenings, create an atmosphere of unease. Several neighbors have mentioned similar concerns about their children's health, though most are reluctant to voice their fears openly.

## Medical History Context

Carl's previous health record showed a robust, healthy child with normal development milestones. His pediatric checkups through 1975 revealed no concerning symptoms or abnormalities. The dramatic decline in his health status beginning in early 1976 represents a stark departure from his established pattern of wellness.

Dr. Patterson's examination in March noted some concerning blood work results, though he recommended a "wait and see" approach rather than immediate specialist referral. Given the escalation of symptoms over the past three months, I believe more aggressive medical intervention may be necessary.

## Daily Care Routine Modifications

I have implemented several changes to Carl's daily routine to accommodate his declining energy levels:

- **Morning routine**: Allowing extra time for dressing and breakfast due to fatigue
- **Medication schedule**: Aspirin for fever management, children's vitamins (though absorption seems questionable given his poor appetite)
- **Activity restrictions**: No strenuous play, limited outdoor time during peak sun hours
- **Nutrition focus**: Emphasis on high-calorie, easily digestible foods when he shows any appetite
- **Rest periods**: Mandatory afternoon quiet time, earlier bedtime routine

## Immediate Concerns and Action Items

The constellation of symptoms—persistent fever, unexplained bruising, severe fatigue, weight loss, and lymph node swelling—creates a clinical picture that demands immediate medical attention. I plan to contact Dr. Patterson's office first thing Monday morning to request an urgent appointment and possible specialist referral.

The possibility of leukemia, given our neighborhood's recent experience with Michael Zona, cannot be ignored despite my desperate hope for alternative explanations. The timing of Carl's symptom onset, coinciding with our continued consumption of municipal water from Wells G and H, suggests potential environmental causation that must be documented and investigated.

I will continue these daily observations and maintain detailed records of his symptoms, medication responses, and any environmental factors that may correlate with changes in his condition. The preservation of this documentation may prove crucial for both his medical treatment and any future investigations into the cause of his illness.

**Next Steps:**
- Schedule urgent pediatric appointment
- Request comprehensive blood work including complete blood count
- Document all symptoms with photographs where appropriate
- Continue daily health observations
- Research specialist care options in Boston area
