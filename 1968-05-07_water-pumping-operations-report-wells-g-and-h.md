# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Water Department Supervisor  
**FROM:** City Water Operator  
**DATE:** May 7, 1968  
**RE:** Weekly Operations Report - Wells G and H Water Pumping Status

## Summary of Operations

This report covers water pumping operations for Wells G and H for the period of April 29 through May 5, 1968. Both wells maintained operational status throughout the reporting period with normal pumping schedules maintained to meet distribution demands in the East Woburn service area.

**Well G Operations:**
- Total pumping hours: 142 hours
- Average daily pumping: 20.3 hours
- Peak demand periods: 6:00 AM - 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM
- Flow rate maintained at 850 gallons per minute
- Total volume pumped: approximately 7.2 million gallons

**Well H Operations:**
- Total pumping hours: 98 hours
- Average daily pumping: 14 hours
- Supplemental operation during peak demand periods
- Flow rate maintained at 720 gallons per minute  
- Total volume pumped: approximately 4.2 million gallons

## System Performance and Maintenance

Both wells performed within normal operational parameters during the reporting period. Routine maintenance was conducted on May 2nd, including inspection of pump housings, electrical connections, and flow measurement equipment. No significant mechanical issues were identified.

The chlorination system at both well sites functioned properly, maintaining residual chlorine levels between 0.5 and 1.0 parts per million as required by state health regulations. Daily chlorine residual tests were conducted and recorded in the operations log. Water pressure in the East Woburn distribution system remained stable, with no customer complaints regarding water pressure or availability received during this period.

## Water Quality Observations

Routine visual inspections of water quality were conducted at both well sites. Water from both wells appeared clear with no unusual odor or taste reported by operations staff during daily testing procedures. The water maintains its characteristic slight chemical taste that has been present since Well G began operations in 1964, which is consistent with the natural mineral content of the underlying aquifer.

Some residents in the Pine Street and Salem Street areas have continued to report occasional unusual tastes in their tap water, particularly during morning hours when demand is highest. These reports are similar to complaints received intermittently over the past two years. The taste has been described as slightly sweet or chemical-like, though it dissipates quickly and does not appear to affect all households in the service area. No correlation has been established between these reports and any operational issues with the wells.

## Distribution System Status

The East Woburn distribution network served by Wells G and H continues to meet demand requirements for approximately 3,200 households in the service area. Peak demand periods align with typical residential usage patterns, with highest consumption occurring during morning and early evening hours. The system maintained adequate pressure throughout the distribution network, with no low-pressure complaints received from customers.

Water main breaks or service line issues were minimal during the reporting period, with only one minor repair required on Oak Street on May 4th. The repair was completed within four hours with minimal service interruption to affected customers.

## Regulatory Compliance

All required water quality testing was completed according to Massachusetts Department of Public Health schedules. Bacteriological samples were collected on May 1st and May 4th from designated sampling points throughout the distribution system. Results from laboratory analysis showed no presence of coliform bacteria, indicating continued compliance with state health standards.

Monthly chemical analysis samples were collected on April 30th and forwarded to the state laboratory for analysis. Results are pending and will be reported when received. Previous monthly analyses have consistently shown compliance with all applicable water quality standards.

## Operational Recommendations

Current pumping schedules for both wells appear adequate to meet service area demand. However, with summer months approaching and anticipated increased water usage, consideration should be given to extending daily pumping hours for Well H to reduce strain on Well G during peak demand periods.

The recent customer reports of unusual taste, while not indicating any health concerns based on available information, may warrant additional investigation. Recommend consultation with state health officials regarding appropriate testing protocols if these reports continue or increase in frequency.

Routine maintenance schedules for both wells should continue as currently planned, with quarterly comprehensive inspections scheduled for June 1968. No equipment replacement or major maintenance is anticipated at this time.
