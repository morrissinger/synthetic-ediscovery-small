# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Regional Manager, Beatrice Foods Corporation  
**FROM:** Operations Director, Riley Tannery Division  
**DATE:** November 18, 1975  
**RE:** Waste Disposal Contract Authorization and Cost Approval

## Contract Authorization Request

This memo serves to formally request authorization for the renewal and expansion of our existing waste disposal contract with John J. Riley Company for the Riley Tannery operations in Woburn, Massachusetts. Following our operational review conducted in October 1975, we have identified the need to increase our waste disposal capacity to accommodate expanded production schedules and new leather processing operations scheduled to commence in January 1976.

The proposed contract modification will increase monthly disposal volumes from 2,800 gallons to 4,200 gallons of industrial solvents and processing chemicals, representing a 50% capacity expansion. John J. Riley Company has confirmed their ability to handle this increased volume through their existing disposal site located on their 15-acre property at the intersection of Salem Street and Olympia Avenue. Their facility has been operating since 1960 and maintains all necessary permits for industrial waste handling operations.

## Cost Analysis and Budget Impact

The expanded contract will increase our monthly disposal costs from $840 to $1,260, representing an annual cost increase of $5,040. This expense falls within our approved operational budget allocation for waste management services and will be absorbed through the existing Environmental Services line item (Account 4720). The per-gallon rate of $0.30 remains competitive with alternative disposal contractors we evaluated during our vendor review process conducted in September 1975.

John J. Riley Company has provided assurances that their disposal methods comply with all applicable Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality standards and that their site operations pose no risk to local groundwater resources. Their facility maintains appropriate containment systems and follows industry standard practices for chemical waste disposal, including proper segregation of different waste streams and regular monitoring of disposal areas.

## Operational Benefits and Risk Management

The expanded capacity will eliminate the need for temporary waste storage on our premises, reducing both safety risks and potential regulatory compliance issues. Our current storage limitations have occasionally resulted in delayed production schedules when disposal pickups were postponed due to weather or equipment issues. The increased contract volume will guarantee priority scheduling for our facility, ensuring consistent waste removal that supports uninterrupted operations.

Additionally, consolidating our waste disposal with a single contractor simplifies our regulatory reporting requirements and maintains continuity in our waste management documentation. John J. Riley Company has demonstrated reliability over our three-year business relationship and maintains comprehensive insurance coverage for their disposal operations, providing appropriate liability protection for Beatrice Foods.

I recommend immediate approval of this contract modification to ensure seamless transition to expanded operations in the new year. The John J. Riley Company contract represents the most cost-effective solution for our increased waste disposal requirements while maintaining appropriate environmental compliance standards.

**Authorization Requested:** Approval for contract modification increasing monthly waste disposal capacity to 4,200 gallons at $0.30 per gallon, effective January 1, 1976.
