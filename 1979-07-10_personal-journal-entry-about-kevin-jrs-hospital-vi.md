# July 10, 1979

Got home from the hospital about an hour ago. Can barely hold this pen steady, my hands are still shaking. Had to take Kevin Jr. to the emergency room this afternoon - third time this month. The fever came back around noon, spiked to 103.8 degrees, and he started getting those terrible nosebleeds again. Blood just pouring out of his nose like a faucet. Donna was crying, trying to clean him up while I called Dr. Morrison's office.

The nurse at Children's Hospital knew us by name when we walked in. That's not something any parent wants to hear - "Oh, the Kane family, room three is ready." Kevin Jr. was so weak I had to carry him from the parking lot. He's only eight years old but he feels like he weighs nothing anymore. Just skin and bones. His little face was so pale, almost gray, and those dark circles under his eyes keep getting worse.

Dr. Morrison ran more blood tests. The results aren't good. His white blood cell count is all over the place - sometimes too high, sometimes too low. The doctor used words I don't understand, talked about his platelet levels and something called blast cells. When I asked him straight out what he thinks is wrong, he got that look doctors get when they're trying not to scare you but they're scared themselves. He said we need to see a specialist in Boston next week. A hematologist. I know what that means even if he won't say it out loud.

Kevin Jr. asked me on the drive home why he's always sick when the other kids aren't. How do you answer that? I told him we're going to figure it out and make him better, but I don't know if I believe it myself anymore. He used to be such an active kid - always outside playing baseball with the neighborhood boys, riding his bike down to the Aberjona River to catch frogs. Now he can barely make it up the stairs to his bedroom without getting winded.

Donna thinks it might be something in the water. She's been talking to some of the other mothers in the neighborhood, and it seems like a lot of kids have been getting sick lately. The Anderson boy down on Salem Street has been in and out of the hospital too. So has little Michael Zona from Pine Street. Mrs. Toomey mentioned at church last Sunday that Patrick's been having problems with his blood work as well. That's four kids just in our immediate area. Four kids who all drink the same water, breathe the same air, play in the same places.

I keep thinking about those wells they put in when we first moved here. Wells G and H, they call them. The city made such a big deal about the new water supply, how it would help the growing population in East Woburn. Clean, fresh groundwater, they said. Better than the old sources. We were happy about it - thought it meant progress, growth for our community. Now I wonder if we should have asked more questions.

The smell has been getting worse lately too. Sometimes when the wind blows from the north, you can smell something chemical, something that burns your nose and makes your eyes water. It seems to come from the direction of that Grace plant on Washington Street, or maybe from over by the old tannery. Donna won't let Kevin Jr. play outside when the smell is strong, but what if it's not just in the air? What if it's in everything - the water, the soil, seeping into our homes?

I called the city water department last week to ask about testing, but they just gave me the runaround. "The water meets all federal standards," they said. "There's nothing to worry about." But if there's nothing to worry about, why are so many children getting sick? Why is my boy wasting away in front of my eyes?

Tonight Kevin Jr. couldn't eat dinner. Donna made his favorite - grilled cheese and tomato soup - but he just pushed it around on his plate. Said his stomach hurt and everything tasted funny. He's been complaining about that metallic taste in his mouth for weeks now. Even water tastes bad to him. We've started buying bottled water from the store, just in case, but it's expensive and I'm not sure it's making any difference.

The worst part is watching him try to be brave. He doesn't complain, doesn't cry, just gets quieter and more tired each day. This afternoon in the hospital, while we were waiting for the test results, he asked me if he was going to die. Eight years old, and he's asking me if he's going to die. I told him no, absolutely not, that Daddy and Mommy and all the doctors are going to make sure he gets better. But the truth is, I'm terrified.

I keep wondering what I did wrong. Was it something I exposed him to? Something I brought home from work on my clothes? Should we have moved away from this area sooner? The questions go around and around in my head, but there are no answers. Just more tests, more hospital visits, more watching my little boy get sicker.

Donna wants to call her sister in Springfield, ask if Kevin Jr. can stay there for a while, see if getting away from Woburn helps. Part of me thinks that's crazy - how can location make that much difference? But another part of me wonders if she's right. If there's something here that's making him sick, maybe distance is the only cure.

I have to believe we'll find answers. I have to believe the doctors in Boston will know what to do. I have to believe my son will get better, will grow up, will have a normal life. Because the alternative is something I can't even let myself think about.

Going to check on him now. Donna's been sitting by his bed for the past hour, just watching him sleep. We take turns now, making sure he's still breathing, still fighting. Tomorrow we'll call Dr. Morrison's office again, push harder for that appointment in Boston. We'll keep asking questions until someone gives us real answers.

Kevin Jr. is going to beat this. He has to.
