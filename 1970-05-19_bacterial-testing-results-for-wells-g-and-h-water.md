# BACTERIAL TESTING RESULTS FOR WELLS G AND H WATER SAMPLES

**Laboratory Report No.:** WOB-70-019  
**Date of Analysis:** May 19, 1970  
**Time of Analysis:** 08:00 hours  
**Laboratory:** Woburn Water Department Laboratory  
**Analyst:** Robert M. Cartwright, Laboratory Technician  

## SAMPLE IDENTIFICATION

**Well G Sample:**
- Sample ID: WG-70-138
- Collection Date: May 18, 1970
- Collection Time: 14:30 hours
- Collected By: James P. Sullivan, Water Department
- Sample Location: Well G Pumping Station, Industrial Avenue
- Well Depth: 88 feet

**Well H Sample:**
- Sample ID: WH-70-139
- Collection Date: May 18, 1970
- Collection Time: 14:45 hours
- Collected By: James P. Sullivan, Water Department
- Sample Location: Well H Pumping Station, Industrial Avenue
- Well Depth: 90 feet

## METHODOLOGY

Bacterial analysis conducted in accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 13th Edition (1971 anticipated standards applied). Testing performed using standard membrane filtration technique for coliform bacteria detection.

**Equipment Used:**
- Millipore filtration apparatus
- 0.45 micron membrane filters
- M-Endo medium
- Incubation chamber maintained at 35°C ± 0.5°C

**Procedure:**
1. Samples collected in sterile 250ml bottles with sodium thiosulfate
2. Filtration performed within 6 hours of collection
3. 100ml sample volumes filtered through sterile membrane
4. Membranes placed on M-Endo medium
5. Incubated for 24 hours at 35°C
6. Colony count and confirmation performed

## RESULTS

### Well G (Sample WG-70-138)

| Parameter | Result | Standard Limit | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------------|--------|
| Total Coliform | 0 CFU/100ml | 0 CFU/100ml | **PASS** |
| Fecal Coliform | 0 CFU/100ml | 0 CFU/100ml | **PASS** |
| General Bacteria Count | 12 CFU/100ml | <100 CFU/100ml | **PASS** |

### Well H (Sample WH-70-139)

| Parameter | Result | Standard Limit | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------------|--------|
| Total Coliform | 0 CFU/100ml | 0 CFU/100ml | **PASS** |
| Fecal Coliform | 0 CFU/100ml | 0 CFU/100ml | **PASS** |
| General Bacteria Count | 8 CFU/100ml | <100 CFU/100ml | **PASS** |

## ANALYSIS AND OBSERVATIONS

Both water samples from Wells G and H demonstrate acceptable bacterial quality according to current Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards for municipal water supplies. No coliform bacteria were detected in either sample, indicating absence of recent fecal contamination.

The general bacterial counts of 12 CFU/100ml (Well G) and 8 CFU/100ml (Well H) are well within acceptable limits for treated municipal water. These levels are consistent with previous monthly testing results from both wells over the past six months.

**Physical Observations:**
- Well G sample: Clear, colorless, no unusual odor detected
- Well H sample: Clear, colorless, no unusual odor detected
- Both samples maintained at 4°C during transport and storage

**Quality Control:**
- Blank filtration control: 0 CFU/100ml
- Positive control (E. coli): Growth confirmed
- Incubation temperature verified: 35.2°C average

## CONCLUSIONS

1. Both Wells G and H water samples meet current bacterial quality standards for municipal water supply
2. No evidence of bacterial contamination requiring immediate remedial action
3. Bacterial levels consistent with adequate disinfection treatment
4. Samples suitable for distribution to municipal water system

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Continue routine monthly bacterial monitoring of both wells
2. Maintain current chlorination levels at wellhead treatment
3. Next scheduled sampling: June 15, 1970
4. Report any unusual taste, odor, or appearance complaints from distribution system users immediately

## CERTIFICATION

This analysis was performed in accordance with standard laboratory procedures and Massachusetts Department of Public Health requirements for municipal water testing. All equipment was properly calibrated and quality control measures were followed.
