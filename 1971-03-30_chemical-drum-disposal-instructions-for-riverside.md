## WORK ORDER #R-71-0330

**PRIORITY:** Immediate Action Required  
**LOCATION:** Riley Tannery Riverside Site, East Woburn  
**ESTIMATED COMPLETION:** End of shift, March 30, 1971

### BACKGROUND

As discussed in yesterday's safety meeting, we have accumulated approximately **forty-seven (47) chemical drums** containing various tanning solutions, degreasers, and industrial solvents at the riverside storage area behind Building C. These drums have been collecting since our equipment changeover in January and must be cleared immediately to make room for incoming leather shipments scheduled for April 2nd.

The drums contain the following materials:
- **Trichloroethylene (TCE)** - 18 drums, 55-gallon capacity each
- **Perchloroethylene (PCE)** - 12 drums, 55-gallon capacity each  
- **Mixed degreasing solutions** - 11 drums, various capacities
- **Chromium-based tanning solutions** - 6 drums, 30-gallon capacity each

### DISPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS

**Step 1: Drum Preparation**
- Inspect each drum for visible leaks or damage
- Mark damaged drums with red paint for separate handling
- Do **NOT** attempt to move severely corroded drums without supervisor approval

**Step 2: Transportation Method**
- Use the company flatbed truck (License #MA-4471-IND) 
- Load drums in groups of no more than 8 at a time
- Secure with rope and tarps as weather requires

**Step 3: Disposal Location**
Transport drums to the **designated disposal area** located approximately 300 yards northeast of the main tannery building, near the marshy ground adjacent to the Aberjona River tributary. This area has been used for similar disposal operations since 1968 and provides adequate drainage away from our primary work areas.

**Step 4: Final Placement**
- Position drums in rows, allowing 3-foot spacing between units
- Puncture drum bottoms with the steel rod (located in truck toolbox) to allow contents to drain
- **Important:** Ensure drainage flows toward the marshy area and away from building foundations
- Cover empty drums with soil from the stockpile maintained at the site

### SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

All workers participating in this operation must:
- Wear company-issued work gloves and boots
- Avoid smoking or open flames within 50 feet of drums
- Report any unusual odors or skin irritation to the shift supervisor immediately
- Wash hands thoroughly before eating or leaving work site

**Note:** The disposal method outlined above has been reviewed and approved by company management as consistent with standard industrial practices. The riverside location provides natural drainage that will carry any residual materials away from our operational areas while minimizing impact on company property.

### WORK ASSIGNMENTS

**Morning Shift (7:00 AM - 3:30 PM):**
- Frank Kowalski (Lead)
- Robert Santos  
- James Murphy
- Anthony Ricci

**Target:** Complete disposal of all 47 drums by end of shift

### COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS

Upon completion of disposal operations:
1. Return all equipment to Building C tool storage
2. Hose down truck bed and tools
3. Submit completion report to Plant Supervisor office
4. Log total number of drums disposed in daily operations log

This disposal operation is necessary for maintaining efficient plant operations and ensuring adequate storage space for spring production schedules. The selected disposal site has proven effective for previous chemical waste removal and will allow us to clear the riverside storage area without disrupting ongoing tanning operations.

Any questions regarding these instructions should be directed to the undersigned immediately. Weather conditions are favorable for this operation, and completion by end of shift is expected.
