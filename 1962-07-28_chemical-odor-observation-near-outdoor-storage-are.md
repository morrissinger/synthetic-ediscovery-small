# INCIDENT REPORT

**TO:** Harold J. Peterson, Facility Safety Manager  
**FROM:** Robert F. Mitchell, Production Supervisor  
**DATE:** July 28, 1962  
**RE:** Chemical Odor Observation Near Outdoor Storage Area  
**REPORT NO:** IR-62-0728-001

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

At approximately 2:45 PM on July 28, 1962, I observed a strong chemical odor emanating from the vicinity of the outdoor storage area located on the eastern perimeter of our facility at 15 Olympia Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts. The odor was sufficiently pronounced to warrant immediate documentation and reporting to facility management for appropriate action.

## DETAILED OBSERVATIONS

While conducting routine inspection of the production floor, I stepped outside through the eastern loading dock to check on material deliveries scheduled for the afternoon shift. Upon exiting the building, I immediately detected a sharp, solvent-like odor that appeared to be originating from the direction of our outdoor chemical storage area. The smell was reminiscent of the trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene solvents we utilize in our film cleaning operations, though more concentrated than typically encountered during normal production activities.

The wind direction at the time was from the southwest, which would carry any vapors from our storage area toward the Aberjona River and the undeveloped land to the east of our property. I observed no visible vapors or unusual discoloration in the immediate area, but the intensity of the odor suggested a potential leak or spill that may require investigation. Two other employees from the afternoon shift—Frank Kowalski and James Murphy—also commented on the unusual smell when they arrived for their 3:00 PM shift change.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

Weather conditions at the time of observation were clear and warm, with temperatures estimated at approximately 78°F. Light winds from the southwest at approximately 5-8 mph. No precipitation had occurred in the previous 48 hours, which may have contributed to the concentration of any chemical vapors in the area.

## POTENTIAL SOURCES

Based on my familiarity with our operations and storage procedures, potential sources for the observed chemical odor include:

- **Solvent Storage Drums**: We maintain approximately 20-25 fifty-five gallon drums of various cleaning solvents in the outdoor storage area, including trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and methylene chloride used in our film processing operations.

- **Waste Solvent Containers**: Several drums containing used solvents awaiting pickup by our waste disposal contractor, Industrial Chemical Services of Boston, are stored in the same general area.

- **Transfer Operations**: Recent transfer of solvents from delivery trucks to storage containers may have resulted in minor spillage or vapor release.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

Upon detecting the odor, I immediately returned to the production floor and notified shift supervisor Margaret Collins of my observations. I instructed loading dock personnel to avoid the eastern storage area until further notice and to report any similar observations to supervision immediately. No production operations were interrupted, as the affected area is separate from our main manufacturing processes.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

I recommend that facility maintenance personnel conduct a thorough inspection of all chemical storage containers in the outdoor storage area to identify any potential leaks, damaged drum seals, or evidence of spillage. Particular attention should be given to the drums containing trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, as these solvents most closely matched the characteristics of the observed odor.

Additionally, I suggest reviewing our current storage procedures to ensure compliance with company safety protocols and applicable regulations regarding outdoor chemical storage. If any spillage is discovered, appropriate cleanup measures should be implemented promptly to prevent further vapor release and potential environmental impact.

## FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED

This incident should be documented in our facility safety log, and I request notification of any findings from the recommended inspection. Should similar odor observations occur in the future, I recommend establishing a more formal reporting protocol to ensure consistent documentation and response procedures.

The proximity of our facility to residential areas and water resources in East Woburn necessitates careful attention to any potential chemical releases, regardless of their apparent magnitude. Prompt investigation and remediation of this incident will demonstrate our commitment to maintaining safe operations and being a responsible corporate neighbor in the Woburn community.
