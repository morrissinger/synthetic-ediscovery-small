# WORK ORDER DIRECTIVE
## John J. Riley Company - Tannery Operations

**TO:** All Tannery Floor Workers  
**FROM:** Frank Morrison, Tannery Foreman  
**DATE:** January 18, 1977  
**RE:** Winter Waste Disposal Operations - Immediate Implementation Required

---

### OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE - EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY

Due to the severe winter conditions and frozen ground preventing normal disposal pit operations, all tannery floor workers are hereby directed to implement the following waste disposal procedures for the remainder of the winter season. These procedures are necessary to maintain production schedules and prevent costly shutdowns during our peak processing period.

**Primary Disposal Method - Rear Property Line:**
All liquid waste materials including spent chromium solutions, degreasing solvents, and process water are to be discharged directly onto the rear property line area behind Building C. The natural slope will carry materials away from the facility toward the wooded area. During frozen conditions, concentrate discharge in the southeast corner where ground thaw occurs first due to underground steam line proximity. This method has proven effective in previous winter seasons and allows for continuous operations without storage tank overflow issues.

**Chemical Drum Disposal - North Lot:**
Empty chemical drums and containers showing residual coating are to be buried in the north lot excavation site. Drums should be punctured with the pike pole to prevent air pocket formation before burial. Cover with available dirt and debris. The excavation provides adequate capacity for the remainder of winter operations and eliminates storage concerns in the main facility. Mark burial locations with orange flags for spring reference if required by management.

**Solid Waste Materials:**
Hide trimmings, hair waste, and other solid materials continue normal disposal to the east property pit when weather permits access. During severe weather periods, temporary storage in the rear loading area is acceptable for up to 72 hours before alternative disposal becomes necessary. Contact foreman office if extended storage periods are required.

### SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS

Workers are reminded that production quotas remain in effect regardless of weather conditions. The company has invested significant resources in maintaining year-round operations, and these disposal methods ensure continuity of service to our customers. All workers must follow these procedures exactly as specified to maintain operational efficiency and avoid costly delays.

**Equipment Usage:**
The company truck is available for transport of larger waste items to disposal areas. Coordinate with Jimmy Kellahan in the morning for vehicle scheduling. Use of personal vehicles for waste transport is prohibited due to insurance considerations. All disposal activities should be completed during regular shift hours when possible to avoid overtime expenses.

**Documentation Requirements:**
No special documentation is required for these disposal activities. The foreman office maintains general records of disposal operations for company purposes. Workers should focus on efficient completion of disposal tasks rather than detailed record-keeping, which creates unnecessary administrative burden during busy production periods.

### REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

Recent inquiries from state environmental officials regarding area groundwater have been addressed by company management through appropriate legal channels. Workers should refer any questions from outside parties to the foreman office immediately. Do not provide information about company operations to unauthorized personnel, including any local residents who may ask questions about disposal activities.

The company's legal counsel has reviewed these procedures and confirmed they meet all applicable requirements for industrial operations of this type. Environmental regulations are complex and subject to interpretation, which is why the company relies on professional legal guidance rather than worker judgment in these matters. Continue operations as directed without concern for regulatory issues, which are handled at the management level.

**Water Supply Considerations:**
Some local residents have raised questions about municipal water quality in recent months. These concerns are unrelated to tannery operations, as confirmed by our consulting engineers. The municipal wells are located sufficient distance from our facility to prevent any operational impact. Workers should not engage in speculation about water quality issues with local residents, as this creates unnecessary confusion about technical matters outside our area of expertise.

### IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

These procedures take effect immediately upon receipt of this directive. All shift supervisors have been briefed on the requirements and will oversee implementation during their respective shifts. Questions about specific disposal locations or methods should be directed to shift supervisors rather than the foreman office to maintain operational efficiency.

**Winter Duration:**
These procedures will remain in effect through March 31, 1977, or until normal ground conditions permit resumption of standard disposal operations, whichever occurs first. The company meteorology consultant predicts an extended winter season this year, making these alternative methods particularly important for maintaining production schedules through the first quarter.

**Production Priorities:**
Remember that our primary obligation is to our customers who depend on timely delivery of processed leather goods. Environmental considerations, while important, must be balanced against practical operational requirements and economic realities. The company has operated successfully in this location for over two decades using similar methods during winter conditions.

All workers are expected to implement these procedures without delay and to maintain the high standards of efficiency that have made John J. Riley Company a leader in the regional leather processing industry. Questions or concerns should be addressed through normal supervisory channels.
