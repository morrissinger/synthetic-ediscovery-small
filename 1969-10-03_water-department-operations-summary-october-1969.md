# WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## OPERATIONS SUMMARY REPORT

**TO:** Woburn Board of Public Works  
**FROM:** Frank Morrison, Water Department Superintendent  
**DATE:** October 3, 1969  
**RE:** Monthly Operations Summary - September 1969

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report summarizes water department operations for the month of September 1969, including production statistics, quality monitoring results, system maintenance activities, and operational recommendations for the upcoming quarter. Overall system performance remained within acceptable parameters, though increased demand from the East Woburn service area continues to require supplemental production from Wells G and H.

### PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION

Total water production for September 1969 reached 847,200 gallons per day average, representing a 12% increase over September 1968 levels. This increase reflects continued residential development in the eastern sections of the city and higher than normal consumption due to extended dry conditions during the latter half of the month.

**Primary Sources:**
- Main Street Wells (Wells 1-4): 623,400 gallons/day average
- Mishawum Lake Facility: 89,600 gallons/day average
- Well G (Pine Street): 78,100 gallons/day average
- Well H (Salem Street): 56,100 gallons/day average

Wells G and H operated on a supplemental basis throughout September, with Well G running approximately 18 days and Well H operating 14 days during peak demand periods. The eastern distribution system, serving approximately 2,400 residential connections east of Main Street (Route 38), drew heavily from these supplemental sources during periods of high demand.

### WATER QUALITY MONITORING

Routine bacteriological testing was conducted at seventeen sampling points throughout the distribution system. All samples met Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards for municipal water supplies. Chlorine residual levels were maintained between 0.2 and 0.8 parts per million throughout the system.

**Chemical Analysis Results:**
- pH levels: 6.8 to 7.4 (within acceptable range)
- Total dissolved solids: 180-220 ppm
- Hardness: 145-165 ppm as CaCO3
- Iron content: 0.15-0.28 ppm

Wells G and H showed slightly elevated iron content compared to the main system wells, requiring increased chlorination to maintain water clarity. This condition has been consistent since these wells became operational and appears related to the geological characteristics of the aquifer in that area.

### SYSTEM MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS

Significant maintenance activities during September included replacement of approximately 400 feet of 6-inch cast iron main along Olympia Avenue and routine valve exercising throughout the eastern distribution network. The pump station serving Wells G and H required minor electrical repairs on September 18th, resulting in a brief interruption of service to portions of the East Woburn area.

**Notable Service Calls:**
- 23 residential service line repairs
- 7 meter replacements
- 4 hydrant maintenance calls
- 12 water quality complaints (primarily taste and odor issues in East Woburn area)

The water quality complaints were investigated and attributed to seasonal algae growth in the distribution system. Increased chlorination and system flushing resolved these issues within 48 hours of initial reports.

### FINANCIAL SUMMARY

September operational expenses totaled $18,640, including $12,200 for personnel, $3,800 for chemicals and supplies, $1,900 for equipment maintenance, and $740 for utilities. Revenue from water sales reached $31,200, maintaining the department's positive cash flow position.

The increased reliance on Wells G and H has resulted in higher pumping costs due to the greater depth of these wells compared to our traditional sources. Additionally, the elevated iron content requires increased chemical treatment costs.

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

The department remains in full compliance with all Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations for municipal water systems. Monthly bacteriological reports have been submitted as required, and all testing protocols are being followed according to established procedures.

A routine inspection by state health officials conducted on September 24th resulted in satisfactory ratings for all facilities and procedures. The inspectors noted the professional condition of our records and the thoroughness of our quality monitoring program.

### OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The continued growth in water demand, particularly in the East Woburn service area, presents ongoing operational challenges. Wells G and H, while providing necessary supplemental capacity, require more intensive monitoring and treatment due to their unique water characteristics.

**Immediate Recommendations:**
1. Increase frequency of water quality testing for Wells G and H from monthly to bi-weekly
2. Install additional chlorination equipment at the eastern pump station to better address iron content issues
3. Develop contingency plans for peak demand periods to minimize reliance on supplemental wells
4. Consider expansion of storage capacity to reduce daily production fluctuations

**Long-term Planning:**
The department should evaluate options for additional water sources to meet projected demand growth through the 1970s. Current projections indicate that demand may exceed our reliable production capacity by 1972-1973 if development continues at present rates.

### PERSONNEL MATTERS

All department personnel completed required safety training during September. John Catalano has been promoted to Assistant Superintendent effective October 1st, and we have hired two additional maintenance workers to support our expanding operations.

The department currently employs twelve full-time personnel and maintains 24-hour emergency response capability through our on-call rotation system.

### CONCLUSION

September operations proceeded smoothly despite increased demand and seasonal challenges. The water system continues to provide safe, reliable service to all customers while maintaining compliance with all applicable regulations. However, the growing reliance on supplemental sources, particularly Wells G and H, requires continued attention to ensure consistent water quality throughout our service area.

I recommend that the Board consider approving the proposed improvements to our monitoring and treatment capabilities to address the unique characteristics of our supplemental water sources and ensure continued high-quality service to all residents.

Respectfully submitted,

Frank Morrison  
Superintendent, Woburn Water Department
