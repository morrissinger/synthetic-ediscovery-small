# TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Solvent Storage Capacity Expansion

**TO:** Harold K. Stevens, Facility Manager  
**FROM:** Robert P. Mitchell, P.E., Chemical Engineer  
**DATE:** January 10, 1972  
**RE:** Assessment of Solvent Storage Capacity Expansion Requirements

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This technical assessment evaluates the current solvent storage capacity at the Cryovac Inc. facility located at 15 Olympia Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts, and provides recommendations for expansion to meet projected production increases for fiscal year 1972-1973. Current storage capacity of 45,000 gallons across twelve above-ground tanks is insufficient to support anticipated 35% increase in production volume. Immediate expansion of storage capacity by 25,000 gallons is recommended to ensure uninterrupted operations.

## CURRENT STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE

### Existing Tank Configuration

The facility currently maintains twelve steel storage tanks with the following specifications:

- **Primary Solvent Tanks (8 units):** 4,500 gallons each, total capacity 36,000 gallons
- **Secondary Storage Tanks (4 units):** 2,250 gallons each, total capacity 9,000 gallons
- **Total Current Capacity:** 45,000 gallons

### Solvent Inventory Analysis

Monthly solvent usage has increased consistently over the past eighteen months:

- **Trichloroethylene (TCE):** 8,500 gallons/month average
- **Perchloroethylene (PCE):** 6,200 gallons/month average  
- **1,1,1-Trichloroethane:** 4,800 gallons/month average
- **Methylene Chloride:** 3,100 gallons/month average
- **Mixed Solvents:** 2,400 gallons/month average

Current monthly consumption totals approximately 25,000 gallons, requiring turnover of existing storage capacity every 1.8 months. This frequency creates operational inefficiencies and increases risk of supply interruption.

## PRODUCTION FORECASTING

### Projected Demand Increases

Based on sales projections provided by Marketing Division and confirmed production schedules, the following increases are anticipated:

**Q2 1972:** 20% increase in flexible packaging production
**Q3 1972:** 28% increase over baseline
**Q4 1972:** 35% increase over baseline
**Q1 1973:** Sustained 35% increase

These production increases will drive proportional increases in solvent consumption, requiring monthly solvent volumes of approximately 33,750 gallons by Q4 1972.

### Storage Safety Margins

Industry best practices recommend maintaining storage capacity equal to 2.5 months of consumption to ensure adequate safety margins for:

- Supply chain disruptions
- Seasonal demand variations  
- Emergency operational requirements
- Quality control hold periods

Based on projected consumption of 33,750 gallons/month, recommended total storage capacity is 84,375 gallons.

## EXPANSION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phase 1 Expansion (Immediate Implementation)

**Primary Recommendation:** Installation of five additional 5,000-gallon steel storage tanks, providing 25,000 gallons additional capacity.

**Proposed Location:** Eastern section of facility property, adjacent to existing tank farm
**Estimated Cost:** $47,500 for tanks, piping, and installation
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks from approval

### Tank Specifications

- **Material:** Carbon steel with protective coating
- **Capacity:** 5,000 gallons each
- **Design Pressure:** 15 PSI
- **Temperature Rating:** -20°F to 180°F
- **Fittings:** 4-inch inlet, 2-inch outlet, 1-inch vent, level gauge

### Infrastructure Requirements

**Piping Modifications:** Extension of existing solvent distribution system with 4-inch steel piping, estimated 200 linear feet
**Electrical:** 480V power supply for transfer pumps and level monitoring equipment
**Containment:** Secondary containment system per Massachusetts DEP requirements
**Fire Protection:** Extension of existing foam suppression system

## REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

### Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection

Current regulations require secondary containment for chemical storage tanks exceeding 1,100 gallons capacity. Proposed expansion will require:

- Updated facility storage registration
- Revised spill prevention plan
- Enhanced groundwater monitoring protocols

### Fire Department Approval

Woburn Fire Department approval required for:
- Increased solvent storage quantities
- Modified fire suppression systems
- Updated emergency response procedures

## ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Groundwater Protection

The facility's location in the Aberjona River watershed requires careful consideration of groundwater protection measures. All new storage tanks will be equipped with:

- Double-wall construction or external containment
- Leak detection systems
- Groundwater monitoring well network expansion

### Waste Management

Increased solvent usage will generate proportional increases in waste solvents requiring proper disposal. Current waste disposal contractor, Environmental Services Inc. of Lynn, Massachusetts, has confirmed capacity to handle increased volumes at current rates of $0.85 per gallon for halogenated solvents.

## COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

### Capital Investment
- Storage tanks and installation: $47,500
- Piping and infrastructure: $18,200  
- Electrical and monitoring: $12,800
- Regulatory compliance: $8,500
- **Total Capital Cost:** $87,000

### Operational Benefits
- Reduced supply chain risk
- Improved production scheduling flexibility
- Reduced per-unit solvent costs through bulk purchasing
- Enhanced safety margins

### Return on Investment

Based on projected production increases and associated revenue growth of $2.4 million annually, the storage expansion represents less than 4% of incremental revenue and will provide operational benefits justifying investment within first year.

## IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)
- Obtain regulatory approvals
- Finalize vendor selection
- Site preparation

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6)  
- Tank delivery and installation
- Piping and electrical work
- Containment system construction

### Phase 3 (Weeks 7-8)
- System testing and commissioning
- Regulatory inspections
- Operational training

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Approval:** Authorize Phase 1 expansion to provide 25,000 gallons additional storage capacity

2. **Regulatory Compliance:** Initiate permit applications with Massachusetts DEP and Woburn Fire Department

3. **Future Planning:** Evaluate additional expansion requirements by Q3 1972 based on actual production performance

4. **Environmental Monitoring:** Implement enhanced groundwater monitoring protocol concurrent with expansion

5. **Staff Training:** Provide additional training for operations personnel on expanded system management

This expansion will position Cryovac Inc. to meet projected production demands while maintaining appropriate safety margins and regulatory compliance. The investment represents a necessary infrastructure improvement to support continued business growth.
