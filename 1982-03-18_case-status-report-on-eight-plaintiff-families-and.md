# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Jan Schlichtmann, Esq.  
**FROM:** Legal Team  
**DATE:** March 18, 1982  
**RE:** Case Status Report on Eight Plaintiff Families and 28 Individual Claims

## Case Overview and Current Status

Following our comprehensive review of the Woburn water contamination matter, we are pleased to provide this detailed status report on the eight plaintiff families and their 28 individual claims against W.R. Grace Company, Beatrice Foods, Cryovac Inc., and John J. Riley Company. The case has evolved significantly since James Anderson's death on January 18, 1981, which served as the catalyst for this litigation.

Our investigation has established a clear pattern of industrial negligence resulting in groundwater contamination that affected municipal Wells G and H, which served approximately 5,000 residents in East Woburn from 1964 through their closure in May 1979. The wells contained trichloroethylene concentrations reaching 400 parts per billion and tetrachloroethylene at 43 parts per billion—levels far exceeding safe drinking water standards.

## Plaintiff Family Profiles and Claims

**Anderson Family (11 Orange Street):** Anne Anderson serves as our lead plaintiff following the wrongful death of her son James Anderson on January 18, 1981. James was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in January 1972 at age three and endured nine years of treatment before succumbing to the disease at age twelve. The family consumed contaminated water throughout James's entire life, from prenatal development through his death. Additional claims include potential health impacts to siblings Christine Anderson (born 1962) and Charles Anderson (born 1966). **Claims: 3 individual claims (wrongful death, negligence damages)**

**Kane Family:** The Kane family presents a particularly compelling case with Kevin Kane Jr. diagnosed with leukemia after extended exposure to contaminated municipal water. The family's residence fell within the primary service area of Wells G and H during the critical contamination period. **Claims: 4 individual claims**

**Zona Family:** Michael Zona's leukemia diagnosis establishes another clear connection between the contaminated water supply and childhood cancer incidence in the affected neighborhood. Medical records confirm diagnosis and treatment timeline corresponding with well contamination period. **Claims: 3 individual claims**

**Toomey Family:** Patrick Toomey's case strengthens our epidemiological argument, as his leukemia diagnosis occurred during peak contamination levels in the municipal water system. Family residence records confirm continuous water service from Wells G and H. **Claims: 4 individual claims**

**Robbins Family:** Carl Robbins III's leukemia case provides additional evidence of the cluster pattern we've identified in East Woburn. The family's long-term residence in the affected area supports our causation arguments. **Claims: 3 individual claims**

**Gamache Family:** Roland Gamache's diagnosis completes our core group of leukemia victims, all sharing the common factor of contaminated municipal water exposure during critical developmental periods. **Claims: 4 individual claims**

**Additional Families:** Two additional plaintiff families have joined our action, bringing claims for property damage, health monitoring costs, and diminished property values resulting from the contamination. **Claims: 7 individual claims**

## Legal Strategy and Defendant Analysis

Our negligence claims against the four defendant companies rest on well-documented evidence of improper chemical disposal practices that directly contaminated the groundwater feeding Wells G and H. Each defendant presents unique liability profiles:

**W.R. Grace Company** operated the Cryovac Division facility on Olympia Avenue, where our investigation has revealed extensive use and disposal of trichloroethylene and other industrial solvents. Internal company documents, when obtained through discovery, should establish knowledge of contamination risks and inadequate disposal practices.

**Beatrice Foods** owned and operated the John J. Riley tannery facility, which utilized significant quantities of industrial chemicals in leather processing operations. The facility's proximity to the well field and documented chemical usage establish clear potential liability.

**Cryovac Inc.** as the direct subsidiary of W.R. Grace, bears primary operational responsibility for the chemical handling and disposal practices at the Olympia Avenue facility during the contamination period.

**John J. Riley Company** operated the tannery facility under Beatrice Foods ownership, creating a complex corporate liability structure that we must carefully navigate through discovery and depositions.

## Damages Assessment

Our preliminary damages assessment across all 28 individual claims includes:

- **Wrongful Death Claims:** $2.8 million for James Anderson's death, with additional wrongful death claims pending for other victims
- **Medical Expenses:** Documented treatment costs exceeding $850,000 across all plaintiff families
- **Pain and Suffering:** Estimated $4.2 million for documented physical and emotional trauma
- **Property Damages:** Diminished property values estimated at $1.1 million for affected residences
- **Future Medical Monitoring:** Projected costs of $650,000 for ongoing health surveillance

## Regulatory and Expert Witness Development

The EPA's involvement and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's epidemiological studies provide crucial governmental support for our causation arguments. We have identified leading environmental health experts and pediatric oncologists who can testify to the causal relationship between TCE/PCE exposure and childhood leukemia incidence.

Dr. Richard Clapp from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has indicated willingness to provide expert testimony regarding the statistical significance of the leukemia cluster in East Woburn. His analysis of cancer incidence rates compared to state averages will be crucial to establishing our case.

## Immediate Action Items

1. Complete service of process on all four defendant companies
2. Initiate comprehensive discovery requests focusing on chemical usage and disposal practices
3. Schedule depositions of key corporate officials and facility managers
4. Retain hydrological experts to map contamination plume migration patterns
5. Coordinate with EPA investigation to obtain governmental findings and test results

This case represents a significant opportunity to establish precedent for corporate environmental liability while securing justice for families devastated by industrial negligence. The strength of our medical evidence, combined with clear regulatory violations and documented contamination, positions us favorably for successful resolution.

We recommend proceeding aggressively with discovery while remaining open to meaningful settlement discussions that adequately compensate our clients for their profound losses and ongoing health concerns.
