# CITY OF WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
**MONTHLY WATER PRODUCTION REPORT**

**TO:** William J. Connors, City Manager  
**FROM:** Robert F. McNeil, Water Department Superintendent  
**DATE:** June 28, 1967  
**RE:** Monthly Water Production Report for Wells G and H - June 1967

## Executive Summary

This report presents the monthly production statistics and operational data for Wells G and H for the month of June 1967. Both wells continued to operate within normal parameters, providing supplemental water supply to the East Woburn distribution system. Total combined production for the month reached 18.2 million gallons, representing a 12% increase over May 1967 due to increased summer demand.

## Well G Production Data

Well G maintained consistent production throughout June, operating primarily during peak demand periods as designed. The well pumped a total of 11.7 million gallons during the month, with daily production averaging 390,000 gallons. Peak production occurred during the week of June 19-25, coinciding with the first significant heat wave of the summer season when residential demand increased substantially.

**Daily Production Summary - Well G:**
- Week 1 (June 1-7): 2.1 million gallons
- Week 2 (June 8-14): 2.4 million gallons  
- Week 3 (June 15-21): 3.1 million gallons
- Week 4 (June 22-28): 4.1 million gallons

The well operated for an average of 16 hours per day during peak periods, with pump efficiency remaining at 78% throughout the month. Water levels in the aquifer showed typical seasonal decline, dropping from 42 feet below surface at month's beginning to 46 feet by month's end. This seasonal variation falls within expected parameters based on historical data since the well's commissioning in 1964.

Routine maintenance was performed on June 14th, including inspection of pump housing and electrical systems. No significant issues were identified, though minor bearing noise was noted and has been scheduled for replacement during the next quarterly maintenance cycle. The chlorination system functioned normally throughout the month, maintaining residual chlorine levels between 0.8 and 1.2 parts per million as required by state regulations.

## Well H Production Data

Well H, commissioned in April 1967, continued its integration into the municipal water system with total June production of 6.5 million gallons. The well operated for an average of 12 hours daily, primarily serving as backup to Well G during peak demand periods. Production capacity has met design specifications, with the well capable of delivering up to 800 gallons per minute at optimal operating conditions.

**Daily Production Summary - Well H:**
- Week 1 (June 1-7): 1.2 million gallons
- Week 2 (June 8-14): 1.4 million gallons
- Week 3 (June 15-21): 1.8 million gallons
- Week 4 (June 22-28): 2.1 million gallons

Initial operational challenges experienced during Well H's first month of service have been resolved. The automatic switching system between Wells G and H now functions reliably, ensuring continuous water supply to the East Woburn distribution network. Water quality testing conducted on June 20th showed all parameters within acceptable ranges, including pH levels of 6.8-7.2 and dissolved solids content of 180-220 parts per million.

## Distribution System Performance

The combined output from Wells G and H successfully met all demand requirements during June, with no service interruptions reported in the East Woburn service area. Pressure readings throughout the distribution network remained stable, averaging 55-65 PSI in residential areas. Fire flow capacity tests conducted on June 12th confirmed adequate pressure and volume for emergency services.

Customer complaints regarding water taste or odor decreased compared to May, with only three inquiries received during the month. These were attributed to seasonal changes in water temperature and were resolved through standard flushing procedures. The East Woburn system now serves approximately 4,200 residential connections and 180 commercial accounts.

## Water Quality Monitoring

Monthly bacteriological testing was completed on schedule, with all samples showing negative results for coliform bacteria. Chemical analysis conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory on June 15th indicated compliance with all federal and state drinking water standards. Chlorine residuals were maintained consistently throughout the distribution system.

Visual inspection of both wellheads revealed no unusual conditions. Well G showed typical seasonal algae growth around the casing, which was cleaned during routine maintenance. Well H's newer installation showed no signs of surface contamination or structural issues. Both wells continue to draw from the same aquifer system underlying East Woburn, providing reliable access to groundwater resources.

## Operational Costs and Efficiency

Total operating costs for Wells G and H during June were $2,840, including electricity, chemicals, and routine maintenance. This represents a cost of $0.156 per thousand gallons produced, slightly below the budgeted rate of $0.165 per thousand gallons. Electricity costs accounted for 68% of total operating expenses, reflecting the energy-intensive nature of groundwater pumping operations.

Pump efficiency ratings remained within acceptable ranges for both wells, though Well G's longer service history shows gradual decline consistent with normal wear patterns. Replacement of major pump components is scheduled for Well G during the fall maintenance period to maintain optimal efficiency.

## Recommendations and Future Planning

Based on June production data and system performance, I recommend continued operation of both wells according to current protocols. The supplemental capacity provided by Well H has proven valuable during peak demand periods and provides important redundancy for the East Woburn water supply system.

Consideration should be given to expanding storage capacity in the East Woburn system to better handle peak demand periods and reduce the number of pump cycling events. Current storage of 500,000 gallons may be insufficient as the community continues to grow and summer demand patterns intensify.

I also recommend scheduling comprehensive water quality testing for both wells during the third quarter to establish baseline data for the combined system operation. This testing should include analysis for industrial chemicals and metals to ensure continued compliance with all health and safety standards as industrial activity in the watershed continues to expand.

## Conclusion

Wells G and H performed reliably throughout June 1967, meeting all production targets and maintaining water quality standards. The combined system provides essential water supply security for East Woburn residents and businesses. Continued monitoring and maintenance will ensure reliable service as we move into the peak summer demand period.
