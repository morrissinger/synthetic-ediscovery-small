## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of childhood leukemia incidence rates in Woburn, Massachusetts, with particular focus on census tracts served by municipal Wells G and H during the period 1964-1979. Analysis reveals statistically significant elevation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases among children residing in eastern Woburn neighborhoods supplied by the affected wells. The observed incidence rate of 7.2 cases per 10,000 children under age 15 exceeds the expected Massachusetts rate of 3.1 cases per 10,000 by a factor of 2.3 (p < 0.001). Temporal analysis demonstrates clustering of cases beginning approximately 18 months after Wells G and H became operational, with peak incidence occurring during 1972-1976.

## Introduction

Following the May 1979 closure of Woburn municipal Wells G and H due to volatile organic compound contamination, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health requested CDC assistance in evaluating reported childhood leukemia cases in the affected service area. This analysis was undertaken to determine whether observed leukemia incidence represents a statistically significant cluster and to assess potential associations with water supply contamination.

Wells G and H, operational from 1964 and 1966 respectively, served eastern Woburn neighborhoods with a combined population of approximately 12,400 residents. Recent testing revealed trichloroethylene concentrations of 267 parts per billion in Well G and 183 parts per billion in Well H, substantially exceeding proposed federal drinking water standards of 5 parts per billion.

## Methodology

### Case Identification

Childhood leukemia cases were identified through multiple surveillance systems:

- Massachusetts Cancer Registry records (1964-1979)
- Hospital discharge data from Massachusetts General Hospital, Children's Hospital Medical Center, and Lahey Clinic
- Death certificate reviews conducted by Massachusetts Department of Vital Statistics
- Physician reporting through Massachusetts Department of Public Health surveillance network

Case inclusion criteria required: (1) diagnosis of acute leukemia in children under age 15, (2) residence in Woburn during time of diagnosis, and (3) diagnosis date between January 1964 and December 1979.

### Geographic Analysis

Census tract boundaries were mapped using 1970 U.S. Census data, with water distribution zones determined from Woburn Department of Public Works records. Residential addresses at time of diagnosis were geocoded and assigned to appropriate water service zones.

### Statistical Methods

Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated using direct standardization to the 1970 U.S. population. Expected case numbers were derived from Massachusetts Tumor Registry age-specific rates for the study period. Statistical significance was assessed using Poisson regression analysis with 95% confidence intervals.

## Findings

### Case Demographics

Twenty-one confirmed cases of childhood acute leukemia were identified in Woburn during the 16-year study period, compared to an expected 9.2 cases based on state incidence rates.

**Table 1: Childhood Leukemia Cases by Water Supply Zone**

| Water Supply Zone | Population <15 | Observed Cases | Expected Cases | Standardized Incidence Ratio | 95% CI |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|---------|
| Wells G/H Service Area | 2,890 | 15 | 6.4 | 2.34 | 1.31-3.86 |
| Other Municipal Wells | 4,120 | 4 | 5.2 | 0.77 | 0.21-1.97 |
| Private Wells | 890 | 2 | 1.6 | 1.25 | 0.15-4.51 |
| **Total Woburn** | **7,900** | **21** | **13.2** | **1.59** | **0.98-2.44** |

### Geographic Distribution

Fifteen of 21 cases (71.4%) resided within the Wells G and H service area at time of diagnosis, representing a 2.34-fold excess over expected incidence (p = 0.003). The highest concentration occurred in census tract 3371, immediately adjacent to Well G, with 8 cases among 847 children (standardized incidence ratio = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.35-6.15).

**Case Locations Within Wells G/H Service Area:**
- **East Woburn (Tract 3371):** 8 cases - James Anderson (age 3), Kevin Kane Jr. (age 2), Michael Zona (age 6), Patrick Toomey (age 7), Carl Robbins III (age 4), Roland Gamache (age 5), plus two additional cases
- **Pine Street Corridor (Tract 3372):** 4 cases
- **Mishawum Road Area (Tract 3373):** 3 cases

### Temporal Analysis

Leukemia incidence showed marked temporal clustering, with 67% of cases occurring between 1970-1977. The earliest case in the Wells G/H service area was diagnosed in December 1965, approximately 18 months after Well G became operational.

**Table 2: Temporal Distribution of Cases**

| Period | Wells G/H Service Area | Other Areas | Total |
|--------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
| 1964-1967 | 2 | 1 | 3 |
| 1968-1971 | 4 | 2 | 6 |
| 1972-1975 | 6 | 2 | 8 |
| 1976-1979 | 3 | 1 | 4 |

### Age and Gender Distribution

Mean age at diagnosis was 4.8 years for cases in the Wells G/H service area compared to 6.2 years for cases in other areas (p = 0.12). Male predominance was observed in the affected area (10 males, 5 females) consistent with general leukemia epidemiology.

### Latency Analysis

For cases with complete residential history, mean duration of residence in the Wells G/H service area prior to diagnosis was 3.4 years (range: 1.1-7.8 years). This latency period is consistent with experimental data on trichloroethylene carcinogenesis in laboratory animals.

## Environmental Correlation

Chemical analysis of Wells G and H revealed:

**Well G (Closed May 22, 1979):**
- Trichloroethylene: 267 ppb
- Tetrachloroethylene: 21 ppb
- Chloroform: 12 ppb
- Trans-1,2-dichloroethylene: 5 ppb

**Well H (Closed May 22, 1979):**
- Trichloroethylene: 183 ppb
- Tetrachloroethylene: 8 ppb
- Chloroform: 7 ppb

These concentrations substantially exceed proposed EPA maximum contaminant levels and have been linked to leukemogenesis in occupational exposure studies.

## Discussion

The statistical analysis provides compelling evidence of a childhood leukemia cluster in eastern Woburn neighborhoods served by Wells G and H. The 2.34-fold excess incidence represents one of the most significant documented associations between environmental contamination and childhood cancer in the epidemiological literature.

Several factors support a causal relationship:

1. **Geographic Specificity:** The excess is confined to areas served by contaminated wells
2. **Temporal Relationship:** Cases cluster after wells became operational
3. **Biological Plausibility:** Trichloroethylene is a recognized carcinogen
4. **Dose-Response:** Highest incidence occurs nearest to Well G (highest contamination)

The latency period of 1-8 years is consistent with leukemogenesis models and previous environmental cancer clusters. The predominance of acute lymphoblastic leukemia matches experimental findings in trichloroethylene-exposed laboratory animals
