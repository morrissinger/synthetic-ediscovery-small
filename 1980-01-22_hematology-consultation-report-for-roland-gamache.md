## CHIEF COMPLAINT

Seven-year-old male referred for evaluation of persistent fatigue, recurrent infections, and abnormal complete blood count findings noted during routine pediatric examination.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Roland Gamache is a 7-year-old white male who presents with a three-month history of progressive fatigue, decreased appetite, and increased susceptibility to upper respiratory infections. According to his mother, Mrs. Patricia Gamache, Roland has experienced five episodes of what she describes as "bad colds" since October 1979, which is unusual for him as he was previously a healthy child with normal childhood illness patterns.

The patient's energy level has declined notably since late autumn. Mrs. Gamache reports that Roland, who was previously active and engaged in normal childhood activities, now requires frequent rest periods and has difficulty completing a full day at East Woburn Elementary School without becoming exhausted. She notes that he often appears pale, particularly around the eyes and mouth, and has complained of intermittent bone pain in his legs, which she initially attributed to growing pains.

Family history is significant for the recent diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a neighborhood child, James Anderson, which prompted Mrs. Gamache to seek medical evaluation for Roland's symptoms. The family resides at 42 Maple Street in East Woburn, approximately 0.8 miles from municipal Wells G and H, which supplied their household water from 1972 until the wells were closed in May 1979.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

Birth history unremarkable. Full-term delivery at Winchester Hospital with normal birth weight of 7 pounds, 2 ounces. Normal developmental milestones achieved. No significant previous hospitalizations. Immunizations current per 1979 CDC recommendations.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

**Vital Signs:** Temperature 99.2°F, Heart Rate 98 bpm, Respiratory Rate 20/min, Blood Pressure 95/60 mmHg, Weight 48 lbs (25th percentile), Height 47 inches (50th percentile)

**General Appearance:** Alert but appears fatigued. Noticeable pallor of conjunctivae, nail beds, and oral mucosa.

**Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Conjunctivae pale. Oral mucosa pale with small petechial lesions noted on soft palate.

**Lymphatic:** Palpable lymphadenopathy noted in cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions. Largest nodes approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, mobile, non-tender.

**Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm. Grade II/VI systolic murmur heard best at apex, consistent with flow murmur secondary to anemia.

**Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No adventitious sounds.

**Abdominal:** Soft, non-distended. Spleen palpable 3 cm below left costal margin. Liver edge palpable 2 cm below right costal margin.

**Extremities:** No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Petechial rash noted on lower extremities.

**Neurological:** Alert and oriented. Age-appropriate responses. No focal deficits.

## LABORATORY RESULTS

**Complete Blood Count (January 22, 1980):**
- White Blood Cell Count: 2,800/μL (Normal: 5,000-15,000)
- Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL (Normal: 11.5-15.5)
- Hematocrit: 21.8% (Normal: 34-40)
- Platelet Count: 45,000/μL (Normal: 150,000-400,000)
- Differential: Lymphoblasts 18%, Neutrophils 35%, Lymphocytes 42%, Monocytes 4%, Eosinophils 1%

**Peripheral Blood Smear:**
Hypochromic, microcytic red blood cells with significant anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. Decreased platelet count with normal morphology. White blood cell population shows presence of immature lymphoid cells consistent with lymphoblasts.

**Chemistry Panel:**
- Lactate Dehydrogenase: 485 U/L (Elevated)
- Uric Acid: 6.8 mg/dL (Elevated)
- Total Protein: 6.2 g/dL (Normal)
- Albumin: 3.8 g/dL (Normal)

## BONE MARROW EXAMINATION

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed from posterior iliac crest under local anesthesia and conscious sedation. 

**Aspirate:** Hypercellular marrow with 78% lymphoblasts. Blasts are medium-sized with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, fine chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining positive in lymphoblasts.

**Biopsy:** Markedly hypercellular marrow (95% cellularity) with extensive replacement of normal hematopoietic elements by sheets of lymphoblasts.

**Cytochemistry:** Sudan Black B negative, PAS positive in coarse blocks, consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

## ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS

**Primary Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), B-cell precursor type

**Secondary Diagnoses:**
1. Severe anemia secondary to bone marrow infiltration
2. Thrombocytopenia with bleeding tendency
3. Neutropenia with increased infection risk

## CLINICAL CORRELATION

This 7-year-old male presents with classic signs and symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, confirmed by bone marrow examination showing greater than 75% lymphoblasts with morphologic and cytochemical features consistent with B-cell precursor ALL. The patient's clinical presentation, including progressive fatigue, recurrent infections, pallor, and bleeding tendency, correlates with the laboratory findings of pancytopenia and bone marrow replacement by malignant cells.

Of particular note is the patient's residence history in the East Woburn area served by municipal Wells G and H, which were closed in May 1979 due to chemical contamination. The patient consumed water from these wells from birth until closure, representing a seven-year exposure period during critical developmental years. While the etiology of childhood leukemia remains multifactorial, recent epidemiological observations in our community have raised concerns about potential environmental factors contributing to the increased incidence of pediatric hematologic malignancies in this geographic area.

## TREATMENT PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Management:**
   - Hospital admission for initiation of chemotherapy protocol
   - Central venous access placement for chemotherapy administration
   - Infectious disease precautions due to neutropenia
   - Platelet transfusion support as needed for bleeding prevention

2. **Chemotherapy Protocol:**
   - Initiate standard pediatric ALL induction therapy per Children's Cancer Study Group protocols
   - Vincristine, Prednisone, L-Asparaginase combination therapy
   - Monitor for treatment response and toxicity

3. **Supportive Care:**
   - Nutritional support and monitoring
   - Infection prophylaxis and surveillance
   - Psychosocial support for patient and family

4. **Follow-up:**
   - Weekly laboratory monitoring during induction phase
   - Bone marrow reassessment after 4 weeks of therapy
   - Long-term follow-up in pediatric hematology-oncology clinic
