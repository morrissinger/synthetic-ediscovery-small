## **Medical History Summary**

Kevin had been a healthy, active child with no significant medical problems until February 1979, when he began experiencing persistent fatigue and loss of appetite. Initial symptoms included:

- **February 1979:** Unusual tiredness, decreased interest in play activities
- **March 1979:** Recurring low-grade fevers, pale complexion noted by teachers
- **April 1979:** Bruising easily, nosebleeds, significant weight loss (8 pounds over 6 weeks)
- **April 25, 1979:** Emergency room visit due to high fever and difficulty breathing
- **April 28, 1979:** Blood work revealed abnormal white cell count, leading to leukemia diagnosis

Dr. Chen has indicated that Kevin's case represents a particularly aggressive form of the disease, requiring immediate and intensive treatment. The oncology team at Mass General has expressed surprise at the severity of presentation in such a young, previously healthy child.

## **Environmental Concerns Discussed**

During our conversation, I informed Dr. Sullivan of several factors that may be relevant to Kevin's illness:

### **Water Supply History**
Our family has lived at 42 Pine Street since 1971, relying exclusively on municipal water from the East Woburn distribution system. We have consumed this water for drinking, cooking, and bathing without any filtration or treatment. The water has occasionally had a chemical odor, particularly during summer months, but city officials assured residents it met all safety standards.

### **Neighborhood Observations**
I reported to Dr. Sullivan that Kevin's illness is not isolated in our immediate area:

- **James Anderson** (age 3) at 67 Pine Street was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in January 1979
- **Michael Zona** (age 5) at 58 Meadow Road received a leukemia diagnosis in March 1979  
- **The Toomey family** at 44 Pine Street has reported their son Patrick (age 4) has been experiencing similar symptoms to what Kevin showed early on

Dr. Sullivan acknowledged these reports and indicated that the department has begun receiving multiple calls from East Woburn families regarding childhood illnesses in recent weeks.

### **Industrial Activity**
I informed the department of the industrial facilities operating in our area, including:

- The large manufacturing plant on Washington Street (Cryovac facility)
- The tannery operation on Salem Street
- Various smaller industrial operations along the Aberjona River

Residents have long noted chemical odors emanating from these facilities, particularly during evening hours and weekends.

## **Department Response and Next Steps**

Dr. Sullivan provided the following information and commitments:

### **Immediate Actions**
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health will:

1. **Document Case Information:** Kevin's case will be entered into the state cancer registry with special notation of geographic location and age at diagnosis
2. **Contact Local Officials:** The department will coordinate with Woburn city health officials to review recent illness reports
3. **Water Testing Coordination:** Dr. Sullivan indicated that discussions are already underway with the EPA regarding comprehensive testing of the East Woburn water supply system

### **Investigation Process**
Dr. Sullivan explained that the department follows established protocols for investigating potential disease clusters:

- **Case Verification:** All reported leukemia cases will be medically verified through hospital records
- **Geographic Analysis:** Mapping of case locations to identify potential environmental sources
- **Exposure Assessment:** Investigation of common environmental factors among affected families
- **Statistical Analysis:** Comparison of local disease rates with state and national averages

### **Timeline Expectations**
The department expects to complete preliminary case verification within 2-3 weeks, with initial water testing results available within 30-45 days. A comprehensive environmental health assessment may require 3-6 months to complete.

## **Follow-Up Requirements**

### **Medical Documentation**
I agreed to provide the following medical records to support the investigation:

- Complete medical records from Dr. Chen's office
- Hospital records from Massachusetts General Hospital
- Laboratory results showing blood work progression
- Treatment protocols and response documentation

### **Exposure History**
Dr. Sullivan requested that I prepare a detailed timeline of Kevin's activities and potential exposures, including:

- Residential history within Woburn
- School attendance records (Pine Street Elementary)
- Recreational activities in the area

### **Contact Information Updates**
I will notify the department immediately of any changes in Kevin's condition or treatment, and will serve as a contact point for other concerned families in the neighborhood.

## **Additional Information Provided**

### **Family Health History**
No history of leukemia or other blood disorders in immediate or extended family. Both parents (Patricia and Kevin Kane Sr.) are in good health with no known occupational chemical exposures.

### **Pregnancy and Early Childhood**
