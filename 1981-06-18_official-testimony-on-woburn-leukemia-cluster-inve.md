# Official Testimony on Woburn Leukemia Cluster Investigation

**TO:** Massachusetts Legislature Joint Committee on Health Care  
**FROM:** Dr. Robert H. Milliken, Director of Environmental Health, Massachusetts Department of Public Health  
**DATE:** June 18, 1981  
**RE:** Investigation of Childhood Leukemia Cluster in East Woburn and Municipal Water Supply Contamination

## Executive Summary

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health submits this formal testimony regarding our ongoing investigation into an apparent cluster of childhood leukemia cases in the East Woburn area of Woburn, Massachusetts. Our preliminary findings indicate a statistically significant elevation in childhood leukemia incidence rates within specific census tracts served by municipal Wells G and H, which have been confirmed to contain industrial solvents at levels exceeding federal safety standards.

This testimony addresses the Department's investigative methodology, preliminary epidemiological findings, environmental sampling results, and recommendations for immediate public health action and long-term regulatory reform.

## Background and Scope of Investigation

### Initial Case Identification

In March 1981, this Department received reports from concerned residents, led by Mrs. Anne Anderson of 11 Orange Street, documenting multiple cases of childhood leukemia within a concentrated geographic area of East Woburn. Mrs. Anderson's son, James Anderson, succumbed to acute lymphocytic leukemia on January 18, 1981, after a nine-year battle with the disease that began when he was three years old.

Our initial case-finding efforts, conducted in collaboration with local physicians and the Massachusetts Cancer Registry, identified twelve cases of childhood leukemia diagnosed between 1969 and 1981 among residents of East Woburn. This represents an incidence rate approximately 7.5 times higher than expected based on statewide childhood leukemia rates for the same age cohort.

### Geographic Distribution Analysis

The affected cases demonstrate a clear geographic clustering pattern, with eleven of the twelve identified cases residing within a 0.5-square-mile area bounded by the Aberjona River to the east, Route 38 to the west, and extending from Montvale Avenue in the south to the Wilmington town line in the north. This area corresponds precisely to the service area of municipal Wells G and H, which began operation in 1964 and 1966, respectively.

## Environmental Investigation Findings

### Water Supply Contamination

Laboratory analysis of water samples from Wells G and H, conducted by the Department's Environmental Laboratory Services Division in April 1981, revealed the presence of multiple chlorinated organic compounds:

**Well G Sample Results (April 15, 1981):**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 267 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 21 parts per billion  
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 85 parts per billion
- Chloroform: 12 parts per billion

**Well H Sample Results (April 15, 1981):**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 183 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 43 parts per billion
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 156 parts per billion
- Trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene: 8 parts per billion

These concentrations significantly exceed the proposed federal maximum contaminant levels for drinking water. The Environmental Protection Agency's proposed standard for trichloroethylene is 2.7 parts per billion, based on a one-in-one-million cancer risk assessment.

### Source Investigation

Our hydrogeological investigation, conducted in partnership with the United States Geological Survey, has identified multiple potential contamination sources within the groundwater recharge area for Wells G and H:

1. **W.R. Grace Company Facility** (Washington Street): Manufacturing operations involving the use and disposal of trichloroethylene and other industrial solvents for degreasing operations.

2. **Cryovac Division Facility** (Washington Street): Production of food packaging materials utilizing various chlorinated solvents in manufacturing processes.

3. **Beatrice Foods Property** (formerly John J. Riley Tannery): Historical tanning operations and subsequent industrial activities involving chemical processing and waste disposal.

4. **John J. Riley Company Operations**: Current and historical leather processing activities utilizing chromium compounds and organic solvents.

Soil and groundwater sampling at these facilities has confirmed the presence of the same contaminants found in the municipal wells, with particularly elevated concentrations detected in monitoring wells downgradient from the W.R. Grace facility.

## Epidemiological Analysis

### Case-Control Study Design

The Department has initiated a formal case-control epidemiological study comparing childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn with age-matched controls from other areas of Woburn and surrounding communities. Preliminary analysis of exposure histories reveals:

- **Water Source Exposure**: All twelve identified leukemia cases resided in homes served by Wells G and H during critical exposure periods (prenatal through early childhood).
- **Duration of Residence**: Cases averaged 8.3 years of residence in the affected area, compared to 4.1 years among controls.
- **Temporal Clustering**: Nine of twelve cases were diagnosed between 1972 and 1979, corresponding to peak contamination periods based on retrospective well water analysis.

### Statistical Significance

Using standardized incidence ratios calculated against Massachusetts state cancer registry data, the observed childhood leukemia rate in East Woburn demonstrates statistical significance (p < 0.001), indicating less than one chance in one thousand that this clustering occurred by random variation alone.

## Public Health Response Actions

### Immediate Protective Measures

1. **Well Closure**: Wells G and H were immediately removed from service on May 22, 1981, following confirmation of contamination levels.

2. **Alternative Water Supply**: Emergency interconnection with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority system was established to ensure continued municipal water service to affected areas.

3. **Medical Surveillance**: Enhanced medical monitoring protocols have been established for residents of the affected area, with particular attention to childhood cancer screening and hematological monitoring.

### Community Notification

Public notification was provided through multiple channels:
- Direct mailing to all residents served by the affected wells
- Public meetings held at Woburn Memorial High School on May 28 and June 3, 1981
- Coordination with local media to ensure accurate reporting of health risks and protective actions

## Regulatory and Legal Implications

### Federal Environmental Protection Agency Coordination

This Department has formally requested EPA Region I to initiate enforcement action under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to consider designation of the contaminated area for priority cleanup under proposed Superfund legislation currently pending in Congress.

### State Regulatory Enhancement Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Monitoring Requirements**: Mandatory quarterly testing of all municipal water supplies for volatile organic compounds, with results reported to this Department within 30 days of analysis.

2. **Industrial Discharge Permitting**: Strengthened permitting requirements for industrial facilities utilizing or disposing of chlorinated solvents, with mandatory groundwater monitoring in areas of potential contamination.

3. **Public Right-to-Know**: Legislative requirement for immediate public notification when drinking water contaminants exceed health-based standards.

## Economic and Social Impact Assessment

### Healthcare Costs

Preliminary analysis indicates that medical treatment costs for the twelve identified leukemia cases exceed $2.4 million in current dollars, representing substantial financial burden on affected families and the state's Medicaid program.

### Property Values and Community Stability

Real estate assessments in the affected area have declined by an estimated 15-25% since public disclosure of the contamination, affecting property tax revenues and community economic stability.

### Psychological and Social Effects

Mental health professionals report increased anxiety, depression, and family stress among residents of the affected area, particularly parents of young children who fear potential health effects from past exposure.

## Long-term Health Monitoring Recommendations

### Expanded Cancer Surveillance

1. **Registry Enhancement**: Expansion of the Massachusetts Cancer Registry to include enhanced case-finding and exposure assessment capabilities for environmental cancer clusters.

2. **Longitudinal Study**: Establishment of a 20-year prospective health study of all residents exposed to contaminated drinking water, with particular focus on cancer incidence and reproductive health outcomes.

3. **Biomarker Research**: Investigation of potential biological markers of exposure and early health effects in exposed populations.

### Environmental Health Capacity Building

This Department recommends legislative appropriation of
