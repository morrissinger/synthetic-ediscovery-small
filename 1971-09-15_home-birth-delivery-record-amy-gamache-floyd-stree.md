## PRENATAL HISTORY

Mrs. Gamache received regular prenatal care throughout pregnancy with monthly visits from March through August 1971.

Patient reported good energy levels and appetite throughout pregnancy, consuming primarily home-cooked meals and drinking municipal water from the family well.

**PHYSICIAN NOTES:**

This delivery represents the second successful home birth for the Gamache family. Mrs. Gamache demonstrated excellent preparation and cooperation throughout the labor and delivery process. The family's Floyd Street residence provided an appropriate environment for home delivery with adequate space, cleanliness, and family support.

Of note, the family relies on municipal water supply from the city of Woburn for all household needs including drinking water, cooking, and bathing. Patient reported consuming 6-8 glasses of tap water daily throughout pregnancy as recommended for adequate hydration. Water source appears adequate based on patient's good health and normal pregnancy progression.

Both mother and infant are in excellent health at time of discharge. Prognosis for both is excellent with appropriate follow-up care.
