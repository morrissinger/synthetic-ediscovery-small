## SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

**PRIORITY:** STAT - Results needed within 4 hours due to clinical presentation suggestive of hematologic malignancy.

**COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Collect blood samples in EDTA tubes for CBC and differential
- Collect serum samples in red-top tubes for chemistry panel
- Collect citrated samples for coagulation studies
- Ensure proper labeling with patient identification and collection time

**NOTIFICATION PROTOCOL:**
- **Immediately notify** Dr. Harrison if:
  - White blood cell count >15,000 or <4,000
  - Hemoglobin <8.0 g/dL
  - Platelet count <100,000
  - Presence of blast cells on peripheral smear
  - Any other critical values per laboratory protocol

**CONSULTATION REQUESTS:**
- If results suggest hematologic malignancy, prepare for **immediate hematology/oncology consultation**
- Consider **bone marrow biopsy** if peripheral blood findings are consistent with leukemia

## CLINICAL RATIONALE

Given the patient's presentation of fatigue, bleeding tendencies, and physical examination findings consistent with possible hematologic disorder, comprehensive blood work is essential for diagnosis. The patient's residence in East Woburn, an area currently under investigation by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for elevated rates of childhood leukemia, heightens clinical suspicion for hematologic malignancy.

Recent community health concerns regarding water quality from Wells G and H, which have supplied water to the patient's neighborhood since 1964, may be relevant to the current clinical presentation. Several other children from the same geographic area have presented with similar symptoms over the past year.

**Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**
1. **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia** - Most likely given age and presentation
2. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia** - Less common in pediatric population
3. **Aplastic Anemia** - Consider given pancytopenia risk
4. **Iron Deficiency Anemia** - Rule out with iron studies
5. **Viral Syndrome** with secondary hematologic effects

## FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS

Results will be reviewed immediately upon completion. Patient and family have been advised to return to Emergency Department if symptoms worsen, including:
- Increased bleeding or bruising
- High fever (>101°F)
- Difficulty breathing
- Severe weakness or dizziness

**Next Steps Based on Results:**
- If leukemia suspected: Immediate pediatric hematology/oncology referral
- If anemia confirmed: Iron supplementation and dietary counseling
- If infection suspected: Appropriate antibiotic therapy
- All results will be documented in patient chart and copies provided to Massachusetts Department of Public Health as part of ongoing community health investigation
