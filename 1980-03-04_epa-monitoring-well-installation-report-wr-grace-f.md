# EPA MONITORING WELL INSTALLATION REPORT
## W.R. GRACE FACILITY WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS

**Report Number:** EPA-R1-HG-80-047  
**Site Reference:** CERCLIS ID MA0000606759  
**Date:** March 4, 1980  
**Classification:** Official Use Only

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents the installation and initial sampling results of monitoring wells MW-1 through MW-8 at and adjacent to the W.R. Grace Company facility located at 369 Washington Street, Woburn, Massachusetts. The investigation was initiated following the closure of municipal Wells G and H in May 1979 due to volatile organic compound (VOC) contamination. Initial groundwater sampling confirms the presence of trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and other industrial solvents at concentrations significantly exceeding federal drinking water standards.

The hydrogeological investigation reveals a contamination plume extending from the W.R. Grace facility property toward the former municipal well field, establishing a potential pathway for groundwater contamination that operated during the fifteen-year period of Wells G and H operation (1964-1979).

### SITE DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND

The W.R. Grace facility occupies approximately 12.8 acres within the Aberjona River Valley, situated northeast of the former Wells G and H municipal water supply. The facility, operated by Cryovac Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of W.R. Grace Company), manufactures food packaging machinery and employs industrial solvents including trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and methylene chloride in cleaning and degreasing operations.

**Geographic Coordinates:**  
- Facility Center: 42°30'15"N, 71°09'42"W  
- Elevation: 45-52 feet above mean sea level  
- Distance to Wells G and H: Approximately 1,200 feet southwest

**Regional Geology:**  
The site is underlain by glacial outwash deposits consisting primarily of sand and gravel with intermittent clay lenses. Bedrock depth ranges from 65 to 80 feet below ground surface. The regional groundwater flow direction is southwest toward the Aberjona River, with an average hydraulic gradient of 0.003 feet per foot.

### METHODOLOGY

#### Well Installation Procedures

Eight monitoring wells were installed between February 12 and February 28, 1980, using a truck-mounted hollow-stem auger drilling rig operated by Geraghty & Miller Environmental Services under EPA contract. Wells were positioned to delineate the extent of groundwater contamination and establish hydraulic connectivity between potential source areas and the municipal well field.

**Well Construction Specifications:**
- Borehole diameter: 8 inches
- Casing material: 4-inch diameter PVC Schedule 40
- Screen type: Machine-slotted PVC, 0.010-inch slots
- Screen length: 10 feet
- Filter pack: #2/12 silica sand
- Annular seal: Bentonite pellets and cement grout
- Surface completion: Flush-mounted steel protective casing

#### Sampling Protocol

Initial groundwater samples were collected using a stainless steel bailer following well development and stabilization. Samples were preserved in glass vials with Teflon-lined caps and maintained at 4°C during transport to EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio.

**Analytical Methods:**
- Volatile Organic Compounds: EPA Method 601 (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry)
- Semi-volatile Organic Compounds: EPA Method 625
- Metals: EPA Method 200 series (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry)
