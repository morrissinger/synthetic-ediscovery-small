# MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
## MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Director, Massachusetts Department of Public Health  
**FROM:** Dr. Michael Stevens, Chief Epidemiologist  
**DATE:** October 2, 1979  
**RE:** Progress Report on Woburn Leukemia Cluster Investigation

---

## Executive Summary

This memorandum provides an interim status update on the ongoing epidemiological investigation into the reported cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Following the closure of municipal Wells G and H in May 1979 due to volatile organic contamination, this department has initiated a comprehensive health study to examine potential correlations between water supply contamination and elevated cancer incidence in the affected community.

## Current Investigation Status

### Case Identification and Documentation

Our epidemiological team has documented **seven confirmed cases** of childhood leukemia in East Woburn residents diagnosed between 1964 and 1979. The affected children are:

- **James Anderson** (deceased 1972, age 3) - 48 Maple Street
- **Kevin Kane Jr.** (deceased 1973, age 2) - 52 Maple Street  
- **Michael Zona** (deceased 1974, age 4) - 58 Maple Street
- **Patrick Toomey** (deceased 1975, age 7) - 41 Trinity Avenue
- **Carl Robbins III** (deceased 1976, age 5) - 44 Trinity Avenue
- **Roland Gamache** (active case, age 6) - 267 Salem Street
- **One additional case under verification**

The temporal clustering of these cases, with six occurring within a four-year period (1972-1976), represents a **statistically significant deviation** from expected childhood leukemia incidence rates for a population of this size. Based on national childhood leukemia rates of approximately 3-4 cases per 100,000 children annually, the expected number of cases in East Woburn during this period would be fewer than two cases.

### Geographic Distribution Analysis

Preliminary mapping indicates a **concentrated geographic pattern** with five of the seven confirmed cases residing within a **0.5-mile radius** of Wells G and H. The affected residences cluster primarily along Maple Street and Trinity Avenue, areas that received water supply from these wells during their operational period (1964-1979). This geographic concentration supports the hypothesis of a **common environmental exposure source**.

### Water Supply Contamination Timeline

Wells G and H operated continuously from their opening dates (Well G: 1964, Well H: 1966) until closure in May 1979. Testing conducted in May 1979 revealed:

- **Trichloroethylene (TCE)**: 267 parts per billion in Well G, 183 parts per billion in Well H
- **Tetrachloroethylene (PCE)**: 21 parts per billion in Well G, 56 parts per billion in Well H
- **Additional volatile organic compounds** at various concentrations

These contamination levels **significantly exceed** safe drinking water standards and indicate chronic exposure of the East Woburn community to industrial solvents throughout the wells' operational period.

## Industrial Source Investigation

### Identified Potential Sources

Our investigation has identified **four industrial facilities** with documented use and disposal of organic solvents in proximity to the contaminated wells:

1. **W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc.** (369 Washington Street)
   - Location: Northeast of Wells G and H
   - Operations: Packaging machinery manufacturing
   - Chemical use: Trichloroethylene, industrial solvents
   - Waste disposal: On-site disposal practices under investigation

2. **Beatrice Foods Inc./John J. Riley Company** (228 Salem Street)
   - Location: Southwest of wells
   - Operations: Leather tanning facility
   - Chemical use: Various industrial solvents and tanning chemicals
   - Property: 14.73-acre site with undeveloped areas

3. **Two additional facilities** currently under investigation

### Hydrogeological Assessment

Preliminary hydrogeological analysis indicates that **groundwater flow patterns** in the Aberjona River Valley could facilitate contaminant transport from these industrial sites to Wells G and H. The wells drew water from an aquifer system that may have received contaminated groundwater from multiple industrial sources over the 15-year operational period.

## Challenges and Limitations

### Documentation Gaps

Several factors complicate the establishment of **definitive causation**:

- **Limited historical water quality data** prior to 1979 testing
- **Incomplete industrial waste disposal records** from the 1960s and 1970s
- **Patient mobility** - some families moved during the exposure period
- **Multiple potential exposure pathways** beyond drinking water

### Methodological Considerations

The investigation faces inherent challenges in demonstrating causation between environmental exposure and health outcomes:

- **Latency period** between exposure and disease manifestation
- **Multiple confounding variables** in cancer etiology
- **Small sample size** limiting statistical power
- **Retrospective exposure assessment** difficulties

## Preliminary Findings and Recommendations

### Initial Assessment

While definitive conclusions cannot yet be drawn, the available evidence suggests a **probable association** between the contaminated water supply and the observed leukemia cluster. The temporal correlation between wells operation (1964-1979) and case occurrence (1972-1979), combined with the geographic clustering of cases in the wells' service area, supports this hypothesis.

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Continued case identification** through medical record review and community outreach
2. **Comprehensive environmental sampling** of soil and groundwater at identified industrial sites
3. **Detailed hydrogeological study** to map contaminant transport pathways
4. **Expansion of health surveillance** to include other cancer types and health outcomes
5. **Community health screening** for residents with documented exposure

### Long-term Study Design

This department recommends proceeding with a **formal case-control study** to systematically evaluate the association between water supply contamination and childhood leukemia incidence. Such a study would require:

- **Detailed exposure assessment** for all residents served by Wells G and H
- **Comprehensive health outcome surveillance** extending beyond the current case series
- **Collaboration with federal agencies** including EPA for environmental assessment
- **Community engagement** to ensure participation and transparency

## Conclusion

The Woburn leukemia cluster investigation has identified a **statistically significant excess** of childhood leukemia cases in a community served by contaminated municipal wells. While multiple challenges exist in establishing definitive causation, the evidence warrants continued investigation and immediate public health action. This department is committed to conducting a thorough scientific investigation while providing appropriate health services to affected families.

The investigation continues with full departmental resources allocated to this priority public health concern. A comprehensive report with detailed findings and recommendations will be submitted within 60 days.
