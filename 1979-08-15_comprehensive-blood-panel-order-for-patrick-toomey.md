## CLINICAL HISTORY

Patrick is the youngest of three children in the Toomey family, residing in the Pine Street area of East Woburn. The family has lived at their current address since 1970 and has been served by the municipal water system including Wells G and H during their period of operation. Mother reports no significant past medical history, normal birth and development, and up-to-date immunizations per Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines.

Recent symptoms began approximately six weeks ago with gradual onset of fatigue and decreased appetite. Over the past two weeks, patient has experienced three episodes of fever ranging from 100.8°F to 102.1°F, accompanied by complaints of bone pain, particularly in legs and back. Mother notes child has become increasingly pale and has had several spontaneous nosebleeds requiring direct pressure for control.

Physical examination today reveals a pale, thin child appearing younger than stated age. Vital signs: Temperature 99.2°F, Pulse 110, Respirations 24, Blood Pressure 95/60. Notable findings include conjunctival pallor, scattered petechiae on bilateral lower extremities and trunk, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy with largest node measuring approximately 2 cm, and hepatosplenomegaly on abdominal palpation.
