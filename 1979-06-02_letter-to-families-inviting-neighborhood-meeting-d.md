# Letter to Families Inviting Neighborhood Meeting Discussion

June 2, 1979

Dear Neighbors,

I hope this letter finds you and your families well, though I know many of us have been struggling with concerns about our children's health and our community's future. As you may have heard, the city shut down Wells G and H last month after they found chemical contamination in our drinking water. The wells that have been supplying water to our neighborhood since the mid-1960s contained industrial solvents that should never have been in our tap water.

I'm writing to you because I believe we need to come together as families and neighbors to understand what has happened to us and what we should do about it. My son Jimmy has been battling leukemia, and I know several other children in our area have faced similar diagnoses. The Kanes lost their boy Kevin Jr., the Zonas are dealing with Michael's illness, and the Toomeys, Robbins, and Gamaches have all been affected. This cannot be a coincidence. We live in the same neighborhood, our children played in the same yards, drank the same water, and now too many of them are sick or gone.

The state health department and the EPA are starting to ask questions about what companies like W.R. Grace and Beatrice Foods have been doing with their chemical waste. We know Grace has been using solvents like trichloroethylene at their Cryovac plant on Washington Street, and God knows what the tannery has been dumping over the years. These companies have been operating in our backyard while our children drank contaminated water from wells that were supposed to be safe.

I think we need to meet as a group to share what we know, compare notes about our children's health problems, and figure out how to get answers. We deserve to know what chemicals our families have been exposed to, how long this contamination has been going on, and who is responsible for what has happened to our children. We also need to understand what our legal options might be, because if these companies poisoned our water supply through negligence or careless disposal of their waste, they should be held accountable for the harm they've caused.

I'm proposing we meet at my house at 42 Meadowbrook Road this coming Saturday, June 9th, at 2:00 in the afternoon. Please bring any medical records, test results, or other documentation you think might be relevant. If you've had conversations with doctors about possible environmental causes of your child's illness, or if you have any information about what the local companies have been doing with their chemical waste, please share that information with the group.

I know this is difficult to talk about, and some of you may feel uncomfortable discussing your family's private medical matters. But I believe we're stronger together than we are alone, and if there's a connection between the water contamination and our children's illnesses, we need to document it and demand action. Our children deserve justice, and the community deserves to know the truth about what has been done to our neighborhood.

If you can't make it Saturday afternoon, please call me at 935-7428 and let me know when would work better. We can arrange additional meetings if needed. I also want to start keeping a list of all the families who might have been affected, so even if you're not sure whether your situation is related, please don't hesitate to reach out.

The city and state officials are finally paying attention to what's been happening here, but we can't rely on them alone to protect our interests. We need to organize ourselves, document what we know, and make sure our voices are heard. Too many of our children have already suffered, and we can't let this continue without fighting back.

I look forward to seeing you all on Saturday. Together, we can work toward getting the answers and justice our families deserve.

With determination and hope,

Anne Anderson

P.S. If you know of other families in the neighborhood who might have been affected but aren't on my list, please encourage them to join us or give me their contact information so I can reach out to them directly.
