# Monthly Water Wells Performance and Efficiency Report

**TO:** City Manager, City of Woburn  
**FROM:** Frank Morrison, Water Department Superintendent  
**DATE:** February 18, 1971  
**RE:** January 1971 Water Wells Performance and Efficiency Analysis

## Executive Summary

This report presents the operational performance and efficiency metrics for the Woburn municipal water system during January 1971, with particular focus on Wells G and H performance data. The month of January saw increased demand on our supplemental wells due to maintenance requirements at our primary Pine Street facility, resulting in extended operational periods for Wells G and H to maintain adequate supply pressure throughout the eastern distribution network.

## Primary Distribution System Performance

The Pine Street pumping station operated at 78% capacity during January due to scheduled maintenance on Pump Unit #3, which was offline from January 8-22 for bearing replacement and impeller reconditioning. During this period, Wells G and H were activated to maintain system pressure and ensure continuous service to all customers, particularly those served by the eastern distribution mains along Main Street, Montvale Avenue, and the residential areas east of Route 38.

Total system production for January reached 47.2 million gallons, representing a 12% increase over January 1970 figures. This increase reflects both population growth in the eastern sections of the city and the extended operational period required from Wells G and H during the Pine Street maintenance window.

## Wells G and H Operational Data

**Well G Performance (January 1971):**
- Total operating hours: 486 hours
- Average daily production: 1.24 million gallons
- Peak production day: January 19 (1.67 million gallons)
- Pump efficiency: 72% (within acceptable range)
- Water temperature: 52-54°F (consistent with historical norms)
- Static water level: 23.4 feet below grade
- Pumping water level: 31.8 feet below grade
- Specific capacity: 89 gallons per minute per foot of drawdown

**Well H Performance (January 1971):**
- Total operating hours: 472 hours
- Average daily production: 1.18 million gallons
- Peak production day: January 19 (1.58 million gallons)
- Pump efficiency: 69% (within acceptable range)
- Water temperature: 51-53°F (consistent with historical norms)
- Static water level: 28.7 feet below grade
- Pumping water level: 37.2 feet below grade
- Specific capacity: 82 gallons per minute per foot of drawdown

Both wells operated within normal parameters throughout the month. The slight decrease in Well H's specific capacity compared to December 1970 (85 GPM/ft) may indicate minor sediment accumulation and should be monitored in coming months. No immediate maintenance action is required.

## Water Quality Monitoring

Routine bacteriological sampling was conducted at both wells according to state requirements, with samples collected weekly and submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory in Boston. All samples returned negative for coliform bacteria. Chlorination equipment at both well sites functioned properly throughout the month, maintaining residual chlorine levels between 0.4-0.8 mg/L in the distribution system.

Physical characteristics remained consistent with historical data:
- pH levels: 6.8-7.2 (both wells)
- Turbidity: Less than 1 NTU (both wells)
- Iron content: 0.3-0.5 mg/L (Well G), 0.4-0.6 mg/L (Well H)
- Hardness: 145-160 mg/L as CaCO3 (both wells)

The slightly elevated iron content in both wells continues to be within acceptable limits but represents the upper range of our historical measurements. This may be attributed to increased pumping duration during January and should normalize with return to standard operational cycles.

## Distribution System Maintenance

The eastern distribution network served by Wells G and H experienced two minor service interruptions during January:
1. January 12: Two-hour shutdown on Montvale Avenue (Oak Street to Salem Street) for main valve replacement
2. January 26: Four-hour shutdown affecting portions of Wood Street and Cross Street for emergency repair of 8-inch main break

Both repairs were completed without significant customer impact, and water service was restored within projected timeframes. The main break on January 26 was attributed to frost penetration during the extended cold snap (January 24-28) when temperatures remained below 10°F for four consecutive days.

## System Capacity and Demand Analysis

Peak system demand during January occurred on January 19, coinciding with the end of the cold snap and increased customer usage. Combined production from all sources reached 4.8 million gallons on this date, representing approximately 85% of total system capacity. Wells G and H contributed 3.25 million gallons (68%) of total production on this peak demand day, demonstrating their critical importance to system reliability.

The extended operation of Wells G and H during January provided valuable data on their sustained production capabilities. Both wells maintained consistent output throughout extended pumping cycles, with no significant decline in production rates or efficiency metrics. This performance confirms their reliability as supplemental sources during periods of high demand or primary system maintenance.

## Budget and Cost Analysis

Operating costs for Wells G and H during January totaled $3,247, including:
- Electrical costs: $2,180 (67% of total)
- Chlorination chemicals: $340 (10% of total)
- Routine maintenance and supplies: $485 (15% of total)
- Laboratory testing: $242 (8% of total)

The increased electrical costs reflect the extended operational period and represent a 34% increase over typical monthly expenses. These costs should return to normal levels in February with resumed standard operational cycles.

## Recommendations

1. **Well H Monitoring:** Continue monthly monitoring of Well H's specific capacity to track potential sediment accumulation. Consider scheduling well development if capacity drops below 80 GPM/ft.

2. **Iron Content Tracking:** Implement monthly iron content testing at both wells to establish trend data and identify any progressive changes in water chemistry.

3. **Emergency Response Preparedness:** The successful extended operation of Wells G and H during January demonstrates their value for emergency response. Recommend maintaining current preventive maintenance schedules to ensure continued reliability.

4. **Distribution System Upgrades:** Consider upgrading isolation valves in the eastern distribution network to minimize service interruption duration during future maintenance activities.

The Woburn Water Department continues to provide reliable, safe drinking water to all customers. Wells G and H have proven their value as dependable supplemental sources and remain integral components of our municipal water supply system.
