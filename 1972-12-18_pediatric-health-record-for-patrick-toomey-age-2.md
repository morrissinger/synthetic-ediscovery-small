## CHIEF COMPLAINT

Mother reports continued concerns regarding Patrick's persistent fatigue, recurrent fevers, and recent episodes of unexplained bruising on legs and arms. Mrs. Toomey states that Patrick has been "not himself" for approximately 6-8 weeks, with decreased appetite and increased irritability.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patrick was last seen in our office on October 15, 1972, for routine immunizations and appeared healthy at that time. According to Mrs. Toomey, symptoms began gradually in early November 1972. She first noticed that Patrick seemed more tired than usual, requiring longer afternoon naps and going to bed earlier without resistance. 

Approximately 3 weeks ago, Mrs. Toomey observed small bruises on Patrick's shins and forearms that she could not attribute to any specific falls or injuries. She initially attributed these to normal childhood activity but became concerned when similar bruising appeared on his back and chest areas that would be unlikely to sustain trauma during play.

Fever episodes have occurred approximately every 3-4 days over the past month, typically reaching 100-101°F (oral), usually in late afternoon or evening. Fevers respond partially to children's aspirin but rarely resolve completely. Mrs. Toomey reports no associated respiratory symptoms, ear pain, or gastrointestinal complaints.

Patrick's appetite has decreased significantly. Previously a "good eater," he now picks at meals and shows little interest in favorite foods. Weight loss is not apparent to mother, but she notes his clothes seem "looser."

## SOCIAL HISTORY

Patrick lives with both parents in single-family home on Wood Street. Family has resided at current address since 1968. Home has city water supply. Mother reports no known exposures to chemicals or toxins. Father works at Consolidated Paper Company, no reported occupational exposures brought home. No pets in household. Patrick attends informal neighborhood playgroup 2-3 times per week.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

**Vital Signs:**
- Temperature: 99.8°F (oral)
- Pulse: 118 bpm
- Respirations: 24/min
- Weight: 28 lbs (down from 31 lbs in October)
- Height: 34 inches

**General Appearance:** Patrick appears pale and somewhat lethargic but cooperative during examination. Obvious weight loss noted since last visit.

**HEENT:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Conjunctivae pale. Oral mucosa pale, no lesions. Throat clear, no erythema or exudate.

**Neck:** Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly

**Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Capillary refill 3-4 seconds.

**Pulmonary:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Good air movement.

**Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Liver edge palpable 2 cm below right costal margin. Spleen tip just palpable below left costal margin.

**Extremities:** Multiple small ecchymoses noted on bilateral lower extremities, ranging from fresh (purple) to healing (yellow-green). Several similar lesions on bilateral upper extremities and trunk. No petechiae observed.

**Skin:** Pale, no rashes, jaundice, or other lesions aside from noted bruising

**Neurologic:** Alert and appropriate for age, normal muscle tone and reflexes

## ASSESSMENT

Three-year-old male presenting with constellation of concerning symptoms including:
1. Progressive fatigue and lethargy
2. Recurrent low-grade fevers
3. Unexplained ecchymoses 
4. Pallor and weight loss
5. Hepatosplenomegaly

Clinical presentation raises significant concern for hematologic malignancy, most likely acute lymphoblastic leukemia given patient's age and symptom complex.

## PLAN

**Immediate:**
1. **Laboratory Studies Ordered:**
   - Complete blood count with differential
   - Comprehensive metabolic panel
   - Liver function tests
   - Coagulation studies (PT/PTT)
   - Peripheral blood smear

2. **Referral:** Urgent referral to Dr. Michael Harrison, Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital. Appointment scheduled for December 22, 1972.

**Patient Education:**
Discussed findings and concerns with Mrs. Toomey. Explained that while Patrick's symptoms could have various causes, the combination of findings necessitates urgent specialist evaluation. Emphasized importance of keeping scheduled hematology appointment.

**Follow-up:**
- Laboratory results will be called to family within 24 hours
- Return to office if fever exceeds 102°F or if new symptoms develop
- Avoid aspirin until hematology consultation completed
- Next routine visit scheduled pending specialist recommendations

**Medications:**
- Discontinue aspirin
- Acetaminophen for fever/discomfort as needed
