# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Woburn City Council Members  
**FROM:** Office of the Mayor  
**DATE:** May 9, 1979  
**RE:** Municipal Water Emergency Response Protocol Implementation Notice

## Immediate Action Required - Water Supply Emergency

Honorable Council Members,

Following the emergency testing results received from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory on May 7, 1979, I am implementing immediate emergency protocols regarding our municipal water supply system, specifically Wells G and H serving the eastern districts of our community. This memorandum serves as formal notification of executive actions taken under Chapter 111, Section 160 of the Massachusetts General Laws and our municipal emergency powers as outlined in the City Charter Section 4-7.

The routine volatile organic compound testing conducted on samples from Wells G and H has revealed the presence of trichloroethylene and other industrial solvents at levels that exceed acceptable standards for public consumption. These findings necessitate immediate protective measures for public health and safety. Effective immediately, Wells G and H are being taken offline pending comprehensive analysis and remediation planning. The Department of Public Works has been directed to isolate these water sources from our distribution system and implement backup supply protocols using our remaining municipal wells and emergency interconnection with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority.

Our legal counsel has advised that we must document all actions taken in response to this contamination discovery to ensure compliance with state health regulations and to protect the city's interests should litigation arise from this matter. The presence of industrial chemicals in our water supply raises serious questions about the waste disposal practices of local manufacturing facilities, particularly those operating in the Aberjona River Valley area near our affected wells. We have a duty to investigate potential sources of contamination while simultaneously protecting our residents from continued exposure.

The Department of Public Health will be conducting expanded testing throughout our water system, and we are coordinating with the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure proper investigation protocols are followed. I am establishing a Water Emergency Response Committee consisting of the Public Works Director, Health Commissioner, City Attorney, and two Council representatives to oversee our response efforts and maintain communication with state and federal agencies. This committee will meet daily until the immediate crisis is resolved and will provide regular updates to the full Council.

I request an emergency Council session be scheduled for May 14, 1979, to discuss funding authorization for emergency water supply measures, expanded testing protocols, and potential legal actions to recover costs associated with this contamination event. The estimated immediate costs for backup water supply and testing are projected at $75,000 through the remainder of the fiscal year, with additional expenses likely as we determine the full scope of remediation required.

The safety of our residents must remain our highest priority as we navigate this unprecedented situation. I will keep you informed of all developments as our investigation proceeds.

Respectfully submitted,

Mayor, City of Woburn
