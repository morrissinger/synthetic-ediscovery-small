## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of routine water quality testing conducted on samples collected from Municipal Wells G and H on March 20, 1972. Testing was performed in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations and EPA interim guidelines for public water systems. Both wells show compliance with current federal and state drinking water standards, though certain parameters warrant continued monitoring.

## SAMPLE COLLECTION METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected from Wells G and H using standard sterile collection procedures as outlined in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Manual for Water System Operations (1971 Edition). Collection was performed during normal operational periods with wells operating at standard flow rates.

**Well G Specifications:**
- Location: Forest Street pumping station
- Depth: 88 feet
- Installation Date: October 1964
- Pump Capacity: 400 gallons per minute
- Sample Collection Time: 09:30 AM

**Well H Specifications:**
- Location: Salem Street pumping station  
- Depth: 90 feet
- Installation Date: June 1966
- Pump Capacity: 600 gallons per minute
- Sample Collection Time: 10:45 AM

Samples were transported to the laboratory within two hours of collection and maintained at 4°C during transport. All glassware was acid-washed and sterilized prior to use.

## ANALYTICAL RESULTS

| Plate Count (35°C) | 18 CFU/mL | 24 CFU/mL | 500 CFU/mL max |

## FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS

### Compliance Status
Both Wells G and H demonstrate compliance with current Massachusetts Department of Public Health drinking water standards and federal interim guidelines. All bacteriological indicators fall within acceptable ranges, indicating no immediate public health risk from microbial contamination.

### Areas of Concern
1. **Manganese Levels**: Both wells show manganese concentrations slightly exceeding the aesthetic standard of 0.05 mg/L, though well below health-based limits. This may contribute to metallic taste and staining issues reported by some consumers.

2. **Odor Detection**: Well H exhibited a slight chemical odor during threshold testing. While not exceeding regulatory limits, this warrants investigation of potential sources and continued monitoring.

3. **Turbidity Variation**: Well H shows elevated turbidity compared to Well G, suggesting possible sediment disturbance or infiltration issues requiring attention.

### Comparison to Previous Results
Review of quarterly testing data from 1971 shows:
- Gradual increase in total dissolved solids in both wells (Well G: +12 mg/L, Well H: +18 mg/L from December 1971)
- Slight upward trend in manganese concentrations (Well G: +0.02 mg/L, Well H: +0.03 mg/L)
- First documented odor detection in Well H (not previously reported)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Increased Monitoring Frequency**: Recommend monthly rather than quarterly chemical analysis for Wells G and H to better track parameter trends, particularly manganese and total dissolved solids.

2. **Source Investigation**: Conduct hydrogeological assessment of Well H catchment area to identify potential sources of chemical odor and elevated turbidity.

3. **Treatment Considerations**: Evaluate feasibility of manganese removal treatment if concentrations continue to increase, as aesthetic complaints may escalate.

4. **Distribution System Flushing**: Implement systematic flushing program for distribution lines served by Wells G and H to address consumer complaints regarding water taste and odor.

5. **Expanded Testing**: Consider analysis for additional parameters including volatile organic compounds and heavy metals as part of comprehensive water quality assessment.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

All analytical procedures were performed in accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (13th Edition, 1971). Laboratory equipment was calibrated using certified reference standards. Duplicate analyses were performed on 10% of samples with results showing acceptable precision (±5% for chemical parameters, ±10% for bacteriological).

Chain of custody documentation is maintained on file at the laboratory. All raw data sheets and calibration records are available for regulatory review upon request.

## CERTIFICATION

I hereby certify that the analyses reported herein were performed in accordance with accepted analytical methods and that the results accurately reflect the composition of the samples as received by this laboratory.
