**Re: Purchase Order No. WRG-69-0847 - Tetrachloroethylene (1000 Gallons)**

Dear Mr. Henshaw:

This letter serves as formal approval and authorization for Purchase Order No. WRG-69-0847 dated September 8, 1969, for the procurement of one thousand (1000) gallons of technical grade tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene) for use in our Cryovac packaging film manufacturing operations at the Woburn facility.

As discussed during our telephone conversation on September 9th, we require delivery of this chemical solvent to support our expanded production schedule for the fourth quarter of 1969. The tetrachloroethylene will be utilized in our vapor degreasing operations for cleaning metal components and in our adhesive formulation processes for specialty packaging applications. Our technical specifications require a minimum purity of 99.5% with water content not exceeding 0.01% by weight, consistent with your standard technical grade product.

Please arrange for delivery to our receiving dock at the rear of Building 2, accessible via the service road from Elm Street. Our facility can accommodate standard tank truck deliveries during normal business hours (7:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Monday through Friday). Upon delivery, your driver should report to our shipping and receiving supervisor, Mr. Anthony Catalano, who will coordinate the transfer to our designated storage area. We have recently expanded our chemical storage capacity with the installation of two additional 1500-gallon underground storage tanks behind Building 2, which will provide adequate containment for this shipment along with our existing inventory.

The agreed-upon unit price of $0.32 per gallon results in a total purchase amount of $320.00, with payment terms of net 30 days from invoice date. Please ensure that all shipping documentation includes our purchase order number WRG-69-0847 and references our account number CSC-4429 for proper processing by our accounts payable department.

We appreciate your continued service as a reliable supplier of industrial chemicals to our Woburn operations. The quality and consistency of your tetrachloroethylene products have been essential to maintaining our production standards and meeting our customers' demanding requirements for food packaging materials. As our business continues to grow, we anticipate placing additional orders for this and other solvents in the coming months.

Please confirm receipt of this authorization and provide an estimated delivery date at your earliest convenience. Should you have any questions regarding this order or our specifications, please contact me directly at extension 247.

Sincerely,

David Martinez
