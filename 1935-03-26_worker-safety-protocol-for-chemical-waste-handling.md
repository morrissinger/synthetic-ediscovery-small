## NOTICE TO ALL PERSONNEL

Effective immediately, all employees involved in chemical waste handling and disposal operations must adhere to the following safety protocols. These procedures have been established to ensure the health and safety of all workers and to maintain proper operational standards at our facility.

### CHEMICAL HANDLING PROCEDURES

**Chromium Compounds and Tanning Solutions:**
All workers handling chromium sulfate solutions, chrome liquors, and related tanning chemicals must wear protective leather aprons and rubber gloves at all times during handling operations. Workers are strictly prohibited from consuming food, beverages, or tobacco products while working with these materials. Hands must be thoroughly washed with soap and water before eating or leaving the work area.

**Solvent and Degreasing Operations:**
Personnel operating degreasing equipment or handling industrial solvents including trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and related cleaning compounds must ensure adequate ventilation in work areas. Windows and ventilation fans must remain operational during all solvent operations. Workers experiencing dizziness, nausea, or unusual fatigue must immediately report to the shift supervisor and remove themselves from the work area.

**Acid and Caustic Solutions:**
When handling sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, or other corrosive solutions, workers must wear protective eyewear and ensure emergency eyewash stations are accessible. Any skin contact with these materials requires immediate flushing with clean water and reporting to supervision.

### WASTE DISPOSAL REQUIREMENTS

**Liquid Waste Management:**
All liquid chemical wastes must be collected in designated metal drums marked with appropriate chemical identification. Under no circumstances shall chemical wastes be discharged directly onto plant grounds, into storm drains, or into surface water. Designated waste storage areas are located in the northwest section of the plant property, adjacent to the railroad siding.

**Solid Waste Protocols:**
Chemical-contaminated rags, filters, and solid materials must be segregated from general refuse and stored in metal containers with tight-fitting lids. These materials shall not be burned in open fires or disposed of with general plant refuse.

**Container Management:**
Empty chemical drums and containers must be triple-rinsed with water before disposal or reuse. Rinse water must be collected and treated as liquid chemical waste. Damaged or leaking containers must be immediately reported to plant supervision for proper handling.

### EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

**Chemical Exposure Incidents:**
Any worker experiencing skin contact, eye contact, or inhalation exposure to chemicals must immediately flush the affected area with clean water and report the incident to the shift supervisor. The company physician, Dr. Franklin Hayes, maintains office hours at the Woburn Medical Building and can be contacted for serious exposures.

**Spill Response:**
Chemical spills exceeding one gallon in volume must be immediately reported to plant supervision. Workers are not to attempt cleanup of large spills without proper equipment and supervision. Sand and absorbent materials are maintained in the chemical storage areas for emergency spill control.

**Fire Safety:**
Chemical storage areas are equipped with specialized fire suppression equipment. Standard water-based firefighting methods must not be used on chemical fires. All workers must be familiar with the location of chemical fire extinguishers and emergency evacuation routes.

### TRAINING AND COMPLIANCE

**Mandatory Training Sessions:**
All employees working with chemicals must attend monthly safety training sessions conducted by plant supervision. These sessions will be held on the first Monday of each month at 7:00 AM in the main plant office. Attendance records will be maintained for all personnel.

**Health Monitoring:**
The company will arrange for annual medical examinations for all workers regularly exposed to chemical materials. These examinations will be conducted by Dr. Hayes at company expense and are mandatory for continued employment in chemical handling positions.

**Disciplinary Actions:**
Failure to comply with these safety protocols will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. The safety of all workers depends upon strict adherence to these procedures, and no exceptions will be permitted.

### REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

**Incident Documentation:**
All accidents, injuries, or chemical exposures must be documented on company incident report forms available from shift supervisors. These reports must be completed within 24 hours of any incident and submitted to plant management.

**Equipment Maintenance:**
Workers must immediately report any damaged or malfunctioning safety equipment, including ventilation systems, eyewash stations, protective gear, or emergency equipment. Continued use of damaged safety equipment is prohibited.

**Environmental Observations:**
Workers are encouraged to report any unusual odors, visible emissions, or environmental conditions that may indicate improper chemical handling or disposal. The company is committed to maintaining proper environmental stewardship while ensuring worker safety.

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

The John J. Riley Company is committed to maintaining compliance with all applicable state and local regulations regarding industrial chemical handling and worker safety. These protocols have been developed in consultation with Massachusetts Department of Labor and Industries guidelines and represent minimum safety standards for our operations.

Plant supervision reserves the right to implement additional safety measures as deemed necessary for specific operations or in response to changing regulatory requirements. All employees are expected to cooperate fully with safety inspections and regulatory compliance activities.
