# WORK ORDER - CHEMICAL WASTE DRUM STORAGE
## ABERJONA RIVER SITE

**TO:** Waste Handling Crew - Day Shift  
**FROM:** Site Foreman, John J. Riley Company  
**DATE:** October 23, 1972  
**WORK ORDER #:** JJR-72-1023-A  
**SITE LOCATION:** Aberjona River Industrial Area, East Woburn  

### IMMEDIATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHEMICAL DRUM PLACEMENT

The following procedures are to be implemented immediately for all incoming chemical waste drums delivered to our Aberjona River site. These instructions supersede any previous verbal directions and must be followed by all crew members handling industrial waste materials.

**DRUM STORAGE AREA DESIGNATION:**
All chemical waste drums are to be placed in the designated storage area located approximately 200 yards northeast of the main equipment yard, adjacent to the wetland area near the Aberjona River tributary. This location has been selected for its accessibility to truck traffic and distance from the main work areas. The ground in this area consists of sandy soil with good drainage characteristics that will prevent accumulation of standing water around the drum storage area.

**PLACEMENT PROCEDURES:**
Drums containing chemical solvents, including but not limited to trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and other industrial cleaning agents, shall be positioned in rows of no more than six drums wide. Maintain adequate spacing between rows to allow for forklift access and visual inspection of drum conditions. Do not stack drums more than two high to prevent structural failure and potential spillage. When placing drums, ensure that any existing rust spots or minor dents face upward to minimize the risk of immediate leakage onto the ground surface.

**DRUM CONDITION MONITORING:**
Crew members are instructed to conduct visual inspections of stored drums on a weekly basis, checking for signs of significant structural deterioration, major rust damage, or active leakage. Minor seepage or small rust spots are considered normal wear and do not require immediate action. However, any drums showing substantial structural compromise should be moved to the secondary containment area located further from the main access road. Document any moved drums in the daily work log but detailed reporting to management is not required for routine maintenance activities.

**SITE ACCESS AND SECURITY:**
The drum storage area is accessible via the existing dirt road that runs parallel to the Aberjona River. This access route should be maintained for regular deliveries from our industrial clients, including ongoing waste disposal contracts with local manufacturing facilities. No special security measures are required for this storage area as it is located on private property and is not readily visible from public roads. The natural screening provided by the existing vegetation along the riverbank provides adequate privacy for our operations.

**SEASONAL CONSIDERATIONS:**
During periods of heavy rainfall or spring snowmelt, temporary pooling of water around the drum storage area is expected and considered normal. The sandy soil composition and natural drainage toward the river system will handle excess water without requiring additional drainage infrastructure. Crew members should continue normal operations during these periods, as the temporary water accumulation will not interfere with drum placement or removal activities.

**CLIENT COORDINATION:**
Several of our regular industrial clients, including local chemical processing facilities, will be increasing their waste disposal volume over the coming months. Crew members should be prepared for more frequent deliveries, particularly from the Grace facility and other manufacturers in the industrial corridor. These clients have been advised of our expanded storage capacity and improved accessibility to the Aberjona River site location.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS:**
The selected storage location takes advantage of the natural geological features of the area, including the sandy soil composition that provides natural filtration of any minor spills or seepage that may occur during normal operations. The proximity to the Aberjona River system ensures that any excess water from the storage area will be naturally carried away from the immediate work zone, maintaining a clean and efficient operation area for our crew.

**EQUIPMENT AND SAFETY:**
Standard safety equipment including work gloves and safety glasses should be worn when handling drums, particularly those showing signs of minor leakage or surface corrosion. The existing forklift and hand trucks are adequate for all drum movement operations. No specialized chemical handling equipment is required for these routine storage and placement activities.

**REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:**
Maintain standard daily work logs documenting the number of drums received and placed in storage. Weekly summaries should note the total drum count and general condition of the storage area. Detailed chemical inventory records are maintained by the main office and are not the responsibility of the field crew. Focus on efficient placement and basic maintenance of the storage area to ensure continued smooth operations.

This work order represents standard operating procedures for our expanded waste handling operations at the Aberjona River site. These procedures have been developed based on industry best practices and our extensive experience in industrial waste management. Crew members should direct any questions about these procedures to the site foreman during regular work hours.

The efficiency and reliability of our waste disposal services depend on consistent implementation of these storage procedures. Our industrial clients rely on our ability to handle their waste materials in a cost-effective manner that meets their operational needs while maintaining the flexibility required for varying waste volumes and types.

**EFFECTIVE DATE:** October 23, 1972  
**REVIEW DATE:** As needed based on operational requirements
