# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Plant Manager  
**FROM:** Robert Martinez, Environmental Compliance Officer  
**DATE:** November 13, 1970  
**RE:** Chemical Storage Area Compliance Review - Third Quarter Inspection Results

Following my quarterly inspection of our chemical storage facilities conducted on November 10, 1970, I am submitting this report on current storage practices and compliance status with applicable regulations. This review covers all designated chemical storage areas within the Cryovac facility, including the primary solvent storage building, secondary containment areas, and temporary staging zones.

## Current Storage Inventory and Conditions

Our primary storage facility currently houses approximately 15,000 gallons of industrial solvents, including trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and various cleaning compounds essential to our manufacturing operations. The concrete floor of the main storage building shows minor surface cracking in the northeast corner, which I have marked for maintenance attention. While these cracks do not appear to present immediate structural concerns, I recommend sealing them during the next scheduled maintenance period to prevent potential seepage issues.

The drum storage area maintains adequate spacing between containers, though I noted that several drums of TCE received in the October shipment lack proper secondary containment. Current practice has been to place these drums directly on the concrete pad, which meets our internal protocols but may not align with evolving industry standards. I have observed similar practices at comparable facilities in the region, though some companies have begun implementing additional containment measures.

## Waste Disposal Procedures

Our current waste disposal procedures continue to follow established protocols developed in consultation with Riley Tanning Company, which has provided disposal services for our facility since 1968. Waste solvents are collected in designated containers and transferred to the disposal contractor on a monthly basis. Documentation for these transfers is maintained in the plant office files, though I recommend we enhance our record-keeping to include more detailed chemical composition data for each shipment.

The temporary waste staging area behind the main building has been expanded to accommodate increased production volumes. This area utilizes gravel bedding and is positioned to facilitate truck access for pickup operations. While this arrangement has proven operationally efficient, I suggest we consider installing improved drainage around the perimeter to manage rainwater runoff during the spring months.

## Recommendations for Continued Compliance

Based on this inspection, I recommend the following actions to maintain our compliance posture and operational efficiency: First, schedule concrete repairs for the storage building floor during the December maintenance window. Second, evaluate the cost and feasibility of implementing secondary containment for all drum storage areas. Third, enhance our waste disposal documentation procedures to include more comprehensive chemical tracking data.

Additionally, I suggest we monitor developments in state and federal environmental regulations, as there appears to be increasing governmental attention to industrial chemical handling practices. While our current procedures meet existing requirements, staying ahead of regulatory trends would serve the company's long-term interests. I will continue to coordinate with our legal counsel and industry associations to track any relevant regulatory developments.

I am available to discuss these findings and recommendations at your convenience. The next quarterly inspection is scheduled for February 1971.
