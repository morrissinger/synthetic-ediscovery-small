## Abstract

This preliminary assessment outlines the Centers for Disease Control's proposed investigation into reports of elevated childhood leukemia incidence in East Woburn, Massachusetts. The investigation will examine potential environmental exposures related to municipal water supply contamination discovered in May 1979, when Wells G and H were found to contain volatile organic compounds including trichloroethylene. This field assessment plan establishes methodological framework for epidemiological analysis, environmental sampling protocols, and case-control study design to evaluate potential causal relationships between groundwater contamination and observed health outcomes.

## Introduction

On November 15, 1979, the Centers for Disease Control received a formal request from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to investigate reports of unusual childhood leukemia clustering in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Preliminary data suggests an incidence rate significantly above expected baseline levels for the affected geographic area, coinciding temporally with operation of municipal Wells G and H (1964-1979).

The investigation was prompted by community concerns raised by local residents, particularly Mrs. Anne Anderson of 28 Meadow Street, whose son James was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in 1972. Mrs. Anderson and other affected families have documented what appears to be a spatial and temporal cluster of childhood leukemia cases in neighborhoods served by the eastern municipal water distribution system.

Wells G and H, which provided supplemental water supply to approximately 5,000 residents in eastern Woburn, were permanently closed in May 1979 following detection of volatile organic compounds during routine testing. Laboratory analysis identified trichloroethylene concentrations of 267 parts per billion in Well G and 183 parts per billion in Well H, levels substantially exceeding proposed federal drinking water standards.

## Background and Rationale

### Geographic and Demographic Context

East Woburn represents a mixed residential-industrial area within the Aberjona River Valley, characterized by glacial deposits creating permeable soil conditions conducive to groundwater contamination. The affected population consists primarily of working-class families residing in single-family homes constructed between 1940-1970.

The municipal water system serving this area relied on Wells G and H as supplemental sources during peak demand periods, typically May through October. During winter months, the eastern distribution system received water primarily from the main municipal supply, creating seasonal variation in exposure patterns that may prove epidemiologically significant.

### Industrial Operations and Potential Sources

Field reconnaissance has identified several industrial facilities within the watershed area that utilized or stored volatile organic compounds during the period of well operation:

**W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc.** - Located at 369 Washington Street, approximately 1,200 feet northeast of Wells G and H. This facility manufactures packaging machinery and has historically used trichloroethylene and other chlorinated solvents in degreasing operations. Site inspection reveals evidence of surface disposal practices and inadequate waste containment.

**Beatrice Foods/John J. Riley Tannery** - Located at 228 Salem Street, approximately 800 feet southwest of the wells. Tanning operations historically utilized various chemical solvents and generated significant liquid waste requiring disposal. Adjacent undeveloped property owned by Beatrice Foods shows evidence of waste disposal activities.

### Preliminary Health Data

Massachusetts Department of Public Health records indicate the following confirmed childhood leukemia cases (ages 0-19) in East Woburn between 1969-1979:

- James Anderson (diagnosed 1972, deceased 1974)
- Kevin Kane Jr. (diagnosed 1973, ongoing treatment)
- Michael Zona (diagnosed 1975, deceased 1976)
- Patrick Toomey (diagnosed 1977, ongoing treatment)
- Carl Robbins III (diagnosed 1978, ongoing treatment)
- Roland Gamache (diagnosed 1979, ongoing treatment)

This represents an age-adjusted incidence rate of approximately 12.8 cases per 100,000 person-years, compared to expected background rate of 3.3 cases per 100,000 person-years for the demographic profile of this population.

## Methodology

### Phase I: Case Identification and Verification

**Objective:** Establish comprehensive case registry of childhood leukemia diagnoses in study area, 1964-1979.

**Methods:**
- Review medical records from all regional hospitals and oncology centers
- Verify diagnoses through pathology reports and physician confirmation
- Establish precise residential addresses and water supply connections
- Create temporal map of diagnosis dates relative to well operation periods

**Data Sources:**
- Massachusetts General Hospital Pediatric Oncology Department
- Children's Hospital Medical Center
- New England Medical Center
- Local pediatrician medical records
- Massachusetts Cancer Registry

### Phase II: Environmental Assessment

**Objective:** Characterize extent and temporal pattern of groundwater contamination.

**Sampling Protocol:**
- Collect water samples from domestic wells within 2-mile radius of Wells G and H
- Test municipal distribution system at multiple points
- Analyze sediment samples from Aberjona River and associated wetlands
- Conduct soil sampling at suspected industrial disposal sites

**Analytical Parameters:**
- Volatile organic compounds (EPA Method 601)
- Priority pollutant metals
- General water quality parameters (pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen)
- Bacterial indicators

**Quality Assurance:**
- Chain of custody procedures
- Duplicate sampling at 10% of locations
- Blind reference standards
- Laboratory certification verification

### Phase III: Epidemiological Investigation

**Study Design:** Matched case-control study with geographic and temporal stratification.

**Case Definition:**
- Primary acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosis, ages 0-19
- Residence in East Woburn during any portion of Wells G and H operation (1964-1979)
- Minimum 6-month residence requirement prior to diagnosis

**Control Selection:**
- Age-matched controls (±2 years)
- Same neighborhood residence requirement
- 4:1 control-to-case ratio
- Random selection from municipal records

**Exposure Assessment:**
- Residential water supply source identification
- Temporal exposure reconstruction using municipal pumping records
- Dietary and lifestyle factor assessment
- Occupational exposure evaluation for family members

**Data Collection:**
- Structured questionnaire administration
- Medical record abstraction
- Environmental exposure modeling
- Geographic information system mapping

## Regulatory and Legal Considerations

This investigation may identify environmental contamination requiring regulatory action under the Safe Drinking Water Act and state environmental protection statutes. Findings may also support potential civil litigation by affected families seeking damages for health impacts and property devaluation.

The CDC will coordinate with the Environmental Protection Agency, Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering, and local health authorities to ensure appropriate regulatory response to identified contamination sources.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Preliminary evidence suggests a statistically significant clustering of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn coinciding with operation of contaminated municipal wells. The proposed investigation will provide scientific basis for evaluating causal relationships between environmental exposures and observed health outcomes.

**Immediate Recommendations:**
1. Initiate comprehensive case
