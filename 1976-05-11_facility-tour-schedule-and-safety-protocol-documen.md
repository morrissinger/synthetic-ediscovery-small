**RE:** Facility Tour Schedule and Safety Protocol Documentation

Bill,

Following our telephone conversation yesterday regarding the upcoming regulatory inspection, I am confirming the arrangements for the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering visit scheduled for May 18, 1976. As discussed, we will implement the standard tour protocol that focuses on our main production areas while ensuring minimal disruption to ongoing operations.

The inspection team, led by Inspector Margaret Chen, will arrive at 9:00 AM and proceed directly to the main entrance reception area. I have instructed our security personnel to escort the group through the designated route that includes the packaging lines, quality control laboratory, and administrative offices. Per our established procedure, the tour will avoid the rear storage areas and the maintenance shop during active solvent handling operations. Our environmental compliance officer, Janet Pierce, will accompany the group and provide technical documentation as requested. I have reminded all department supervisors to ensure that any temporary storage containers in work areas are properly labeled and that all safety equipment is visibly accessible during the inspection period.

Regarding the documentation requests in their advance notice, I have prepared the required files covering our waste disposal procedures, chemical inventory reports, and employee safety training records for the past eighteen months. The materials are organized in accordance with DEQ guidelines and include our monthly disposal manifests showing regular pickup by Northeast Environmental Services. I have also included copies of our internal safety protocols and the recent equipment maintenance logs for our ventilation systems. As you suggested, I have emphasized our compliance with all applicable Massachusetts environmental regulations and our commitment to maintaining the highest safety standards for our workforce.

I will contact you immediately following the inspection to provide a complete briefing on any issues raised or additional information requested. Please let me know if you need any clarification on these arrangements or if W.R. Grace requires copies of any documentation prior to the inspection date.
