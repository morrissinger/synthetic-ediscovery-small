# ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENT REPORT
**Chemical Spill - Loading Area**

---

**REPORT CLASSIFICATION:** Internal Company Use Only  
**INCIDENT NUMBER:** WRG-73-001-ENV  
**REPORTING OFFICER:** Robert M. Henderson, Safety Officer  
**DEPARTMENT:** Cryovac Division Safety & Environmental Compliance  
**DATE OF INCIDENT:** January 29, 1973  
**TIME OF INCIDENT:** Approximately 14:30 hours  
**DATE OF REPORT:** January 30, 1973  
**TIME OF REPORT:** 08:15 hours

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

On January 29, 1973, at approximately 2:30 PM, a chemical spill occurred in the loading area adjacent to Building C at the Cryovac facility located at 15 Olympia Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts. The incident involved the accidental discharge of approximately 150-200 gallons of industrial solvent mixture containing trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) during routine transfer operations from storage tank T-7 to transport vehicle.

## LOCATION DETAILS

**Primary Spill Area:** Loading dock, east side of Building C  
**Secondary Affected Areas:** Gravel surface extending approximately 50 feet east toward property boundary  
**Proximity to Water Sources:** Approximately 800 feet northwest of city wells area  
**Soil Conditions:** Sandy gravel over clay substrate  
**Weather Conditions:** Clear, temperature 28°F, light wind from southwest  

## PERSONNEL INVOLVED

**Primary Operator:** Thomas R. Kellerman, Chemical Handler, Employee ID 1247  
**Supervisor Present:** Frank J. Morrison, Loading Supervisor  
**Witnesses:** David L. Chen, Maintenance Technician; Maria Santos, Quality Control Inspector  
**First Responder:** Robert M. Henderson, Safety Officer  

## SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

### 14:25 Hours
Kellerman began routine transfer of solvent mixture from storage tank T-7 to Acme Chemical Transport truck (License MA-4471-C) using standard 3-inch flexible hose connection. Transfer was proceeding normally with flow rate approximately 25 gallons per minute.

### 14:30 Hours
Kellerman reported hearing unusual "popping" sound from hose coupling area. Upon investigation, discovered that primary coupling had failed, resulting in complete disconnection of transfer hose from tank outlet valve. Immediate cessation of transfer operations attempted but estimated 150-200 gallons had already discharged onto loading dock surface.

### 14:32 Hours
Morrison notified of incident via plant communication system. Emergency shutdown procedures initiated for tank T-7. Kellerman attempted to contain spread using available absorbent materials from emergency spill kit located in Building C.

### 14:35 Hours
Henderson arrived at scene and assumed incident command. Observed that spilled material had spread across approximately 1,200 square feet of loading dock area and was beginning to penetrate gravel surface. Immediate area cordoned off and additional absorbent materials deployed.

### 14:45 Hours
Plant Manager William F. Donovan notified of incident. Decision made to engage Northeastern Environmental Services for professional cleanup and soil assessment.

## IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACTIONS

1. **Containment:** Deployed 200 pounds of industrial absorbent material around perimeter of spill area
2. **Personnel Safety:** Evacuated non-essential personnel from 100-foot radius; respiratory protection provided to cleanup crew
3. **Documentation:** Photographic documentation completed (Photos 1-12 on file)
4. **Notification:** Plant management, corporate safety department, and insurance carrier notified per company protocol
5. **Cleanup Initiation:** Removal of contaminated absorbent material and surface gravel commenced at 16:00 hours

## EQUIPMENT FAILURE ANALYSIS

Examination of failed coupling revealed significant wear on primary seal ring and corrosion of metal components. Coupling had been in service for approximately 18 months since last inspection. Maintenance records indicate last scheduled inspection completed September 15, 1972. Failure appears consistent with normal wear patterns for equipment handling chlorinated solvents, though earlier replacement may have been prudent.

## ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Immediate Impact
- Contamination of approximately 1,200 square feet of gravel surface
- Penetration of solvent into subsurface estimated at 2-4 feet based on soil conditions
- No immediate impact to surface water bodies observed
- Air monitoring conducted; vapor concentrations within acceptable workplace limits after initial ventilation

### Potential Long-term Concerns
- Subsurface soil contamination requiring ongoing monitoring
- Potential for groundwater impact if contamination migrates through clay substrate
- Need for comprehensive soil sampling program to establish extent of contamination

## REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

This incident may require reporting to Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering under Chapter 21E regulations regarding discharge of hazardous materials. Corporate legal department should review notification requirements and potential liability exposure.

Federal EPA notification requirements under Section 311 of Clean Water Act should also be evaluated, particularly given proximity to Aberjona River watershed.

## CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### Immediate Actions
1. Replacement of all flexible hose couplings in chemical transfer system
2. Implementation of daily visual inspection protocol for all transfer equipment
3. Installation of secondary containment system in loading area
4. Enhanced training program for chemical handling personnel

### Planned Actions
1. Comprehensive soil sampling program to be conducted by February 15, 1973
2. Evaluation of permanent loading dock improvements including concrete surface and integrated containment system
3. Review and revision of chemical transfer procedures with emphasis on equipment inspection intervals
4. Installation of automatic shutoff systems for all bulk chemical transfer operations

## COST ESTIMATES

**Immediate Cleanup:** $3,200 (Northeastern Environmental Services)  
**Contaminated Material Disposal:** $1,800 (estimated)  
**Equipment Replacement:** $650  
**Soil Sampling Program:** $2,400 (estimated)  
**Loading Area Improvements:** $15,000-25,000 (preliminary estimate)  

**Total Estimated Cost:** $23,050-33,050

## LEGAL AND INSURANCE IMPLICATIONS

This incident presents potential exposure under several legal theories:

1. **Environmental Liability:** Potential cleanup costs and natural resource damages under state environmental statutes
2. **Third-party Claims:** Possible groundwater contamination could affect neighboring properties
3. **Regulatory Enforcement:** Potential fines and penalties for unpermitted discharge
4. **Insurance Coverage:** Comprehensive General Liability policy should cover cleanup costs; Environmental Impairment Liability coverage may apply

Immediate consultation with corporate legal counsel recommended to evaluate notification obligations and develop litigation hold procedures for all relevant documents and communications.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Legal Review:** Engage environmental counsel to assess regulatory notification requirements and potential liability exposure
2. **Documentation Preservation:** Implement litigation hold on all documents, photographs, and communications related to this incident
3. **Stakeholder Communication:** Develop coordinated response strategy for potential regulatory inquiries or community concerns
4. **Preventive Measures:** Accelerate implementation of enhanced containment systems across all chemical handling areas
5. **Monitoring Protocol:** Establish groundwater monitoring program in coordination with environmental consultants

## CONCLUSION

While this incident was contained quickly and professional cleanup initiated promptly, the volume of material discharged and the proximity to municipal water supply sources present significant environmental and legal concerns. The failure of routine equipment during standard operations highlights the need for enhanced preventive maintenance protocols and improved containment systems.

Continued vigilance regarding potential groundwater impacts will be essential, and close coordination with legal counsel is recommended to ensure compliance with all applicable reporting requirements while protecting the company's interests.
