# CITY OF WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## Daily Water Quality Monitoring Report
### Wells G and H

**Report Date:** May 7, 1968  
**Report Time:** 10:00 AM  
**Prepared by:** Robert E. Sullivan, Water Quality Technician  
**Submitted to:** Thomas F. McCarthy, Water Department Chief

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of routine water quality testing performed on Wells G and H for the period of May 6-7, 1968. Testing was conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines and municipal water quality protocols established in 1965. Both wells remain operational and within acceptable parameters for municipal distribution, though certain anomalous readings warrant continued monitoring.

## Well Specifications and Operating Status

### Well G
- **Location:** Eastern Woburn, off Aberjona River
- **Depth:** 88 feet
- **Operational Status:** Active
- **Flow Rate:** 850 gallons per minute (as of 0800 hours, May 7)
- **Service Area:** East Woburn residential district, east of Main Street (Route 38)

### Well H
- **Location:** Eastern Woburn industrial district
- **Depth:** 92 feet
- **Operational Status:** Active
- **Flow Rate:** 920 gallons per minute (as of 0800 hours, May 7)
- **Service Area:** East Woburn residential and light industrial areas

## Testing Methodology

Water samples were collected from both wells at 0630 hours on May 7, 1968, following standard collection protocols. Samples were obtained directly from well heads prior to chlorination treatment. Testing was performed using department standard equipment calibrated on May 1, 1968. Chemical analysis conducted using colorimetric methods and standard titration procedures as specified in the Massachusetts Public Health Code, Chapter 111, Section 160.

## Test Results - Well G

### Physical Parameters
- **Temperature:** 52°F
- **pH:** 6.8
- **Turbidity:** 2.1 NTU
- **Color:** Light amber tint (noted since April 15)
- **Odor:** Slight chemical odor detected at tap

### Chemical Parameters
- **Chloride:** 18 mg/L
- **Iron:** 0.8 mg/L
- **Manganese:** 0.15 mg/L
- **Hardness (as CaCO3):** 145 mg/L
- **Total Dissolved Solids:** 280 mg/L

### Bacteriological Results
- **Total Coliform:** Negative
- **E. coli:** Negative

## Test Results - Well H

### Physical Parameters
- **Temperature:** 54°F
- **pH:** 7.1
- **Turbidity:** 1.8 NTU
- **Color:** Clear
- **Odor:** None detected

### Chemical Parameters
- **Chloride:** 22 mg/L
- **Iron:** 0.6 mg/L
- **Manganese:** 0.12 mg/L
- **Hardness (as CaCO3):** 158 mg/L
- **Total Dissolved Solids:** 295 mg/L

### Bacteriological Results
- **Total Coliform:** Negative
- **E. coli:** Negative

## Analysis and Observations

Both wells continue to meet Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards for municipal water supply. However, several observations merit documentation:

**Well G Anomalies:**
The persistent amber coloration first observed on April 15, 1968, continues to be present in raw water samples. While iron and manganese levels remain within acceptable limits (iron <1.0 mg/L, manganese <0.5 mg/L per state standards), the discoloration suggests possible mineral content changes in the aquifer. The slight chemical odor, described by field personnel as "sweet" or "solvent-like," has been noted intermittently since late March 1968.

**Well H Performance:**
Well H continues to produce clear, odorless water with consistent chemical parameters. Flow rates have remained stable, and no unusual characteristics have been observed.

**Comparative Analysis:**
Both wells draw from the same general aquifer system beneath East Woburn. The differences in water characteristics between the two wells may reflect varying depths and specific geological formations encountered at each site. Well G's position closer to the Aberjona River may contribute to its slightly different chemical profile.

## Regulatory Compliance

All test results fall within acceptable ranges established by:
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations
- Federal Public Health Service standards
- Municipal water quality ordinances adopted in 1965

Current chlorination treatment (0.5-0.8 mg/L residual) is adequate for distribution system protection.

## Recommendations

1. **Continue daily monitoring** of both wells with particular attention to Well G's color and odor characteristics
2. **Schedule quarterly comprehensive analysis** including expanded chemical testing panel
3. **Document any consumer complaints** regarding taste, odor, or appearance of water from East Woburn distribution system
4. **Maintain current chlorination levels** pending further evaluation
5. **Consider consultation with state health department** if Well G anomalies persist beyond May 31, 1968

## Action Items

- Submit weekly summary report to Mayor's office by May 10, 1968
- Schedule equipment calibration for May 15, 1968
- Review consumer service records for East Woburn area complaints
- Coordinate with Public Works Department regarding distribution system maintenance

## Certification

I hereby certify that the above tests were conducted in accordance with established procedures and that the results accurately reflect the conditions of Wells G and H as of the date and time specified.
