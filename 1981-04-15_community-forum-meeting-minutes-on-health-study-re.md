## AGENDA ITEM 1: PRESENTATION OF PRELIMINARY HEALTH STUDY FINDINGS

Dr. Margaret Walsh from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health presented preliminary findings from the ongoing health assessment of East Woburn residents. Dr. Walsh emphasized that the study is still in progress but acknowledged community concerns following recent childhood deaths in the area.

**Key Points Presented:**
- Statistical analysis shows elevated rates of childhood leukemia in East Woburn neighborhoods served by Wells G and H
- Six cases of childhood leukemia diagnosed between 1969-1981 in families residing on Orange, Maple, and Pine Streets
- Normal expected rate for this population would be approximately 1.2 cases over the same period
- Water quality testing has identified presence of industrial solvents in municipal Wells G and H

**Questions from Community:**

*Anne Anderson (Orange Street):* "Doctor, my son James died three months ago after fighting leukemia for nine years. We've lived at 11 Orange Street since 1964, drinking water from those wells his entire life. What I want to know is whether the chemicals in our water caused his death."

*Dr. Walsh:* "Mrs. Anderson, I understand your loss and your need for answers. While we cannot establish direct causation for individual cases at this time, the statistical clustering we're observing suggests environmental factors may be contributing to the elevated disease rates in your neighborhood."

*Patricia Kane (Maple Street):* "My son Kevin has been battling leukemia since 1977. He's only eight years old. Are you telling us that the water we've been giving our children to drink has been poisoning them?"

*Dr. Walsh:* "The presence of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene in Wells G and H is confirmed. These are known carcinogenic substances. However, establishing the link between exposure and individual disease cases requires more comprehensive epidemiological analysis."

## AGENDA ITEM 2: WATER SYSTEM STATUS AND IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

Mayor Higgins provided updates on municipal water system operations and immediate protective measures being implemented.

**Actions Taken:**
- Wells G and H have been temporarily shut down as of March 1981
- Alternative water supply arrangements made with neighboring municipalities
- Independent water quality testing commissioned through environmental consulting firm
- Coordination established with EPA Region I office for federal oversight

**Community Concerns Raised:**

*Bruce Young (Pine Street):* "Mayor, my family has been drinking this water for fifteen years. My daughter Laurie was diagnosed with leukemia in 1975 when she was six. We need to know who's responsible for contaminating our water supply and what the city is going to do about it."

*Mayor Higgins:* "Mr. Young, I understand your frustration. The city is cooperating fully with state and federal agencies to identify the source of contamination. We're also exploring all legal options to hold responsible parties accountable."

*Donna Robbins (Pine Street):* "My son Carl has been sick since 1979. He's only seven years old. Are there other families dealing with this? How many children have to get sick before something is done?"

**Discussion Points:**
- Multiple families reported childhood cancers and other health issues in the affected area
- Residents expressed concerns about property values and long-term health effects
- Questions raised about industrial activities in the area and potential sources of contamination
- Requests for medical monitoring and support for affected families

## AGENDA ITEM 3: INVESTIGATION STATUS AND NEXT STEPS

**Current Investigation Activities:**
- Expanded health survey to include all residents served by Wells G and H since 1964

- Coordination with federal agencies for comprehensive site evaluation
- Medical record review for all reported cases

**Timeline:**

## AGENDA ITEM 4: LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS

Discussion of potential legal proceedings and regulatory oversight.

*Anne Anderson:* "I've been talking with other families, and we're considering legal action. We need to know if the city will support us in holding the companies responsible for this contamination accountable."

*Mayor Higgins:* "Mrs. Anderson, the city is committed to supporting our residents in every way possible. We're working with our legal counsel to understand all available options, including potential municipal action against responsible parties."

**Legal Considerations Discussed:**
- Potential civil litigation by affected families
- Municipal legal options against contaminating parties
- Coordination with state and federal enforcement actions
- Documentation preservation for potential legal proceedings
