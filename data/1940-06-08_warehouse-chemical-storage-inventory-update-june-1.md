## STORAGE FACILITY CONDITIONS

### Structural Assessment
The warehouse concrete floor shows signs of chemical staining in multiple areas, particularly around the solvent storage room and acid storage bay. Several small cracks have developed near the loading dock, likely due to heavy drum traffic and temperature fluctuations. The drainage system continues to function adequately, channeling spill runoff toward the floor drains that connect to the facility's waste system.

### Ventilation Status
Mechanical ventilation in the solvent storage room operates satisfactorily, though the exhaust fan motor requires periodic maintenance. Natural ventilation through warehouse windows provides adequate air circulation for general storage areas. No immediate concerns regarding vapor accumulation.

### Safety Considerations
Personal protective equipment remains available for warehouse staff handling chemical containers. Fire suppression equipment inspected monthly and found adequate. Emergency spillage materials (sand, lime) maintained in designated locations throughout the facility.

## USAGE PATTERNS AND CONSUMPTION NOTES

Production demands have increased significantly due to military leather goods contracts. Solvent consumption for hide degreasing has risen 40% compared to the same period last year. Chrome tanning chemicals show steady usage consistent with normal production schedules.

The leaking benzene drum requires immediate attention. Recommend transferring contents to sound container and disposing of damaged drum through established channels. Spilled material has been absorbed with sawdust and removed to the waste area behind the facility.

## DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

During this inventory period, the following materials were removed from storage:
- 14 empty solvent drums disposed of in rear yard area
- Contaminated absorbent materials buried on-site
- Waste chemical solutions channeled to facility drainage system
- Unusable chrome-contaminated leather scraps buried in designated area south of main building

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate:** Address leaking benzene drum and assess other containers for integrity
2. **Short-term:** Improve drainage around solvent storage area to prevent pooling
3. **Long-term:** Consider expanding chemical storage capacity to meet increased production demands

The current inventory levels appear adequate for projected production through the remainder of June. Recommend placing orders for additional chromium sulfate and trichloroethylene by month's end to maintain adequate stock levels for July operations.
