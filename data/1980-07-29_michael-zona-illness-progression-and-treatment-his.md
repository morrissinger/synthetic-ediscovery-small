## CLINICAL HISTORY AND DISEASE PROGRESSION

### Initial Presentation - March 1979

Michael Zona, a previously healthy 6-year-old male, first presented to Woburn Family Practice on March 15, 1979, with complaints of persistent fatigue, pallor, and recurrent upper respiratory infections. Parents reported that Michael had been experiencing increasing lethargy over the preceding two months, with difficulty maintaining normal activity levels for a child his age. Initial physical examination revealed pale conjunctivae, mild lymphadenopathy in cervical and axillary regions, and scattered petechiae on lower extremities.

Complete blood count performed March 16, 1979, revealed:
- White blood cell count: 2,100/μL (normal: 5,000-15,000/μL)
- Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL (normal: 11.5-15.5 g/dL)
- Hematocrit: 24.6% (normal: 34-40%)
- Platelet count: 45,000/μL (normal: 150,000-400,000/μL)

Peripheral blood smear demonstrated immature white blood cells consistent with blast cells. Patient was immediately referred to Children's Hospital Boston for further evaluation.

### Diagnostic Confirmation - March 1979

Bone marrow biopsy performed March 22, 1979, at Children's Hospital Boston confirmed the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cytogenetic analysis revealed Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor ALL. Lumbar puncture performed the same date showed no evidence of central nervous system involvement at initial diagnosis.

**Staging:** Standard Risk ALL based on age and initial white blood cell count.

### Treatment Protocol and Response

Michael was enrolled in the Children's Cancer Group Protocol CCG-161 for standard risk ALL, beginning March 28, 1979. Treatment protocol included:

**Induction Phase (March-May 1979):**
- Vincristine 2 mg/m² weekly x 4 doses
- Prednisone 60 mg/m²/day x 28 days with taper
- L-asparaginase 10,000 units/m² three times weekly x 9 doses
- Intrathecal methotrexate for CNS prophylaxis

Initial response was favorable with achievement of morphologic remission documented by bone marrow examination on April 25, 1979. Blast cell percentage reduced to less than 5% with recovery of normal hematopoiesis.

**Consolidation Phase (May-August 1979):**
- High-dose methotrexate 1 g/m² with leucovorin rescue
- 6-mercaptopurine 75 mg/m²/day
- Continued intrathecal therapy

### Disease Progression and Complications

Despite initial favorable response, Michael experienced significant treatment-related complications beginning in summer 1979. These included:

1. **Severe mucositis** requiring hospitalization in June 1979 for IV hydration and pain management
2. **Prolonged neutropenia** with absolute neutrophil count below 500/μL for extended periods
3. **Multiple episodes of febrile neutropenia** requiring broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy
4. **Hepatotoxicity** with elevated transaminases (ALT 245 U/L, AST 198 U/L) necessitating dose modifications

### Relapse and Salvage Therapy - January 1980

Routine bone marrow examination performed January 14, 1980, revealed morphologic relapse with 35% blast cells. Michael had experienced 10 months of first remission. CNS examination remained negative for leukemic involvement.

**Salvage Protocol:** Patient was enrolled in experimental protocol using:
- Cytarabine 100 mg/m² continuous infusion x 7 days
- Daunorubicin 45 mg/m² daily x 3 days
- Vincristine and prednisone as per standard protocol

### Clinical Deterioration and Conscious Suffering

Following relapse, Michael's clinical condition deteriorated significantly despite aggressive salvage chemotherapy. Documentation of conscious suffering includes:

**February-March 1980:**
- Persistent severe bone pain requiring narcotic analgesics
- Patient verbalized pain level 8-9/10 on pediatric pain scale
- Frequent episodes of nausea and vomiting despite antiemetic therapy
- Progressive weakness and inability to participate in age-appropriate activities
- Sleep disturbances due to pain and discomfort
- Decreased appetite with 15% weight loss from baseline

**April-May 1980:**
- Development of severe oral mucositis with inability to tolerate oral intake
- Requirement for total parenteral nutrition
- Progressive pancytopenia with bleeding complications
- Multiple blood product transfusions required
- Patient expressed fear and distress regarding medical procedures
- Documented episodes of crying and withdrawal from family interactions

**June-July 1980:**
- Second bone marrow relapse confirmed June 18, 1980
- Progressive hepatosplenomegaly with abdominal distension and discomfort
- Development of respiratory distress requiring supplemental oxygen
- Decreased level of consciousness with periods of confusion
- Family conferences regarding comfort care measures

### Terminal Phase and Death

Michael Zona died on July 22, 1980, at Children's Hospital Boston at 3:47 AM. Death was attributed to complications of acute lymphoblastic leukemia including sepsis secondary to neutropenia and multi-organ failure. The patient experienced conscious pain and suffering throughout the final months of illness despite palliative interventions.

**Duration of illness:** 16 months from initial diagnosis to death  
**Age at death:** 7 years, 10 months

## ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE HISTORY

Family residence at 47 Wildwood Avenue, East Woburn, was supplied by municipal water from Wells G and H during the period 1972-1979, encompassing Michael's entire lifetime prior to illness onset. Wells G and H were closed in May 1979 due to contamination with trichloroethylene and other volatile organic compounds. The Zona family reported no other known environmental exposures or family history of malignancy.

## MEDICAL OPINION

In my professional opinion, Michael Zona suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia resulting in his death on July 22, 1980. The patient experienced significant conscious pain and suffering during the 16-month illness, particularly during the final 6 months when salvage therapy failed to control his disease. The suffering was both physical, manifested by severe pain, nausea, and weakness, and emotional, demonstrated by fear, distress, and withdrawal from normal childhood activities.

The damages sustained by this child and his family include not only the ultimate loss of life but also the prolonged period of suffering, multiple hospitalizations, loss of normal childhood experiences, and the psychological trauma associated with terminal illness in a young child.
