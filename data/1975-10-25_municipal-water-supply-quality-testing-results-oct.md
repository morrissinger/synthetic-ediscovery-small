## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of routine water quality testing conducted on the Woburn municipal water supply system for the period of October 1-15, 1975. Testing was performed on samples collected from Wells G and H, the primary sources serving the East Woburn distribution area, as well as from representative distribution points throughout the system. All testing procedures followed Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines and EPA recommended protocols for municipal water systems.

## SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected from the following locations on October 2, 8, and 14, 1975:

- **Well G** (Maple Street): Raw water samples collected at wellhead
- **Well H** (Salem Street): Raw water samples collected at wellhead  
- **Distribution Point A**: Montvale Road residential area
- **Distribution Point B**: Pleasant Street commercial district
- **Distribution Point C**: Main Street municipal buildings

All samples were collected in sterile glass containers following standard collection protocols. Samples were transported to the laboratory within two hours of collection and analyzed within 24 hours. Chain of custody procedures were maintained throughout the testing process.

## LABORATORY ANALYSIS RESULTS

### Bacteriological Testing

| Sample Location | Total Coliform (per 100ml) | Fecal Coliform (per 100ml) | Standard |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| Well G | 0 | 0 | <1 |
| Well H | 0 | 0 | <1 |
| Distribution Point A | 0 | 0 | <1 |
| Distribution Point B | 0 | 0 | <1 |
| Distribution Point C | 0 | 0 | <1 |

**Result:** All bacteriological tests meet Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards.

### Physical and Chemical Parameters

| Parameter | Well G | Well H | Dist. A | Dist. B | Dist. C | Standard |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| pH | 6.8 | 7.1 | 7.0 | 7.2 | 7.1 | 6.5-8.5 |
| Turbidity (NTU) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 0.9 | 1.0 | 0.8 | <4.0 |
| Chlorine Residual (mg/L) | N/A | N/A | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.2-4.0 |
| Total Dissolved Solids (mg/L) | 285 | 320 | 295 | 305 | 290 | <500 |
| Hardness (mg/L as CaCO3) | 145 | 168 | 152 | 160 | 148 | N/A |
| Iron (mg/L) | 0.15 | 0.28 | 0.18 | 0.22 | 0.16 | <0.3 |
| Manganese (mg/L) | 0.04 | 0.08 | 0.05 | 0.06 | 0.04 | <0.05 |

**Note:** Manganese levels in Well H slightly exceed recommended guidelines but remain within acceptable ranges for municipal supply.

### Organic Chemical Analysis

Limited organic chemical testing was conducted using available laboratory equipment. The following compounds were analyzed using gas chromatography methods:

| Compound | Well G | Well H | Detection Limit | Notes |
|----------|---------|---------|----------------|--------|
| Benzene | <0.01 mg/L | <0.01 mg/L | 0.01 mg/L | Below detection |
| Toluene | <0.01 mg/L | <0.01 mg/L | 0.01 mg/L | Below detection |
| Xylene | <0.01 mg/L | <0.01 mg/L | 0.01 mg/L | Below detection |

**Laboratory Note:** Organic chemical testing capabilities are limited by current equipment. More comprehensive analysis would require samples to be sent to Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory in Boston.

## DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS

The October 1975 testing results indicate that the Woburn municipal water supply generally meets established water quality standards for bacteriological and basic chemical parameters. However, several observations warrant attention:

1. **Manganese Levels**: Well H continues to show elevated manganese concentrations approaching the recommended guideline of 0.05 mg/L. While not a health concern at current levels, this trend should be monitored.

2. **Iron Content**: Both wells show measurable iron content, which may contribute to taste and odor complaints from residents in the East Woburn service area.

3. **Limited Organic Testing**: Current laboratory capabilities restrict comprehensive organic chemical analysis. Given increasing industrial activity in the watershed area, enhanced testing protocols may be warranted.

4. **Well Performance**: Both Wells G and H continue to provide adequate flow rates to meet municipal demand, with no significant changes in water levels observed during the testing period.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All tested parameters fall within Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards for municipal water supplies. The water system remains in compliance with applicable state regulations. No immediate corrective actions are required based on current test results.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Consider monthly rather than quarterly testing for Wells G and H, given their critical role in serving the East Woburn residential area.

2. **Expanded Testing**: Investigate options for more comprehensive organic chemical analysis, potentially through partnership with state laboratory services.

3. **Manganese Treatment**: Monitor manganese levels in Well H and consider treatment options if levels continue to approach regulatory limits.

4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of all testing results to establish baseline data for future comparison and regulatory reporting.

5. **Public Communication**: Continue providing annual water quality reports to residents as required by state regulations.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

All testing was conducted using calibrated equipment following standard operating procedures. Quality control samples were analyzed with each batch, and results fell within acceptable ranges. Laboratory equipment was last calibrated on September 15, 1975, and is scheduled for next calibration on December 15, 1975.

## CONCLUSION

The October 1975 water quality testing indicates that the Woburn municipal water supply meets current regulatory standards and is suitable for public consumption. Continued monitoring and adherence to established testing protocols will ensure ongoing compliance with public health requirements.
