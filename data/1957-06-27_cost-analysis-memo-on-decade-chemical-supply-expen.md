# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Riley Company Board of Directors  
**FROM:** John J. Riley, President  
**DATE:** June 27, 1957  
**RE:** Cost Analysis Memo on Decade Chemical Supply Expenditure Increases

## Executive Summary

This memorandum presents a comprehensive analysis of the substantial increases in chemical supply expenditures experienced by our tannery operations over the past decade (1947-1957). Our procurement department has documented a 340% increase in chemical costs during this period, significantly exceeding general inflation rates and creating material impact on our operational margins. The primary cost drivers include increased usage of chromium sulfate compounds, sulfuric acid solutions, and various organic solvents essential to our leather processing operations.

## Detailed Cost Analysis

Our accounting department has prepared detailed expenditure records demonstrating that chemical supply costs have risen from $12,400 annually in 1947 to $42,160 in fiscal year 1956. This dramatic increase reflects both rising unit costs from our suppliers—Decade Chemical Corporation, Boston Chemical Supply Company, and New England Industrial Chemicals—and substantially increased volume requirements to meet expanded production demands.

The most significant cost increases have occurred in our chromium tanning operations, where we have transitioned to higher-concentration chromium sulfate solutions to achieve improved leather quality and processing efficiency. Additionally, our degreasing operations now require substantially larger quantities of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene solvents to meet customer specifications for finished leather products. These organic solvents, while essential for achieving the quality standards demanded by our automotive and furniture industry clients, represent our fastest-growing expense category.

Our facility at 228 Salem Street has expanded production capacity by approximately 60% since 1950, necessitating proportional increases in chemical inputs. However, the cost increases have exceeded production volume increases by a substantial margin, indicating that unit chemical costs are rising independent of our operational scale. Market conditions in the chemical supply industry appear to reflect post-war industrial expansion and increased demand across all manufacturing sectors.

## Operational Considerations and Recommendations

The Board should be aware that these increased chemical expenditures directly correlate with our ability to maintain competitive positioning in the Massachusetts leather industry. Our current chemical processing methods, while expensive, ensure that Riley Company leather products meet or exceed industry quality standards. Any reduction in chemical inputs or substitution of lower-grade materials would likely result in product quality deterioration and potential loss of major customer accounts.

I recommend that the Board authorize continued expenditures at current levels while directing our procurement department to investigate alternative suppliers and negotiate long-term supply contracts to achieve cost stability. Additionally, we should consider capital investments in chemical recovery systems that might reduce our overall solvent consumption through recycling and reprocessing of used materials. Such systems, while requiring initial capital expenditure, could provide meaningful cost savings over the medium term while maintaining our production quality standards.

The chemical supply cost increases represent a significant business challenge, but one that affects all participants in our industry sector. Our commitment to quality leather production requires continued investment in appropriate chemical processing materials, and I believe our current expenditure levels remain justified by our market position and customer satisfaction metrics.
