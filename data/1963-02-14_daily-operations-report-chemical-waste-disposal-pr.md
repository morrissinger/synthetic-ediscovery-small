# INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Operations Manager, Beatrice Foods Corporation  
**FROM:** Plant Supervisor, Riley Tannery Division  
**DATE:** February 14, 1963  
**RE:** Daily Operations Report - Chemical Waste Disposal Procedures

This memorandum provides an update on current waste disposal operations at the Riley Tannery facility located at 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, following our recent acquisition and integration into Beatrice Foods operations.

**Current Disposal Methods and Volumes**

Daily chemical waste output from our tanning operations continues at approximately 2,400 gallons per day, consisting primarily of chromium sulfate solutions, sodium sulfide compounds, and various organic solvents used in the hide processing sequence. Per established procedures dating from the Riley family ownership period, these waste materials are being discharged through our existing drainage system which connects to the natural drainage patterns leading toward the Aberjona River system. The discharge point remains at the southeastern section of the property, approximately 300 yards from the river bank.

Our chemical storage area currently maintains inventory of the following materials for ongoing operations: 850 gallons of chromium sulfate solution, 420 gallons of sodium sulfide concentrate, 180 gallons of formic acid, and 95 gallons of various organic cleaning solvents. These materials are stored in the concrete-lined pit area constructed in 1952, which has served adequately for containment purposes throughout the previous decade of operations. The storage facility continues to meet our operational requirements and provides cost-effective management of chemical inventory.

**Operational Efficiency and Cost Management**

The current waste disposal system provides significant operational advantages in terms of both efficiency and cost control. Direct discharge of processing waste eliminates the need for expensive third-party waste management services, which would represent an estimated additional operational cost of $180-220 per month based on current volume requirements. The existing system allows for continuous operations without interruption for waste collection or transport, maintaining our production schedule reliability that has been essential to meeting Beatrice Foods' leather goods supply contracts.

Additionally, the established disposal patterns have proven effective in managing the various chemical byproducts of our tanning processes without creating any observable operational difficulties. The natural drainage characteristics of the East Woburn terrain provide adequate dispersion of waste materials, and we have not received any complaints from neighboring properties or municipal authorities regarding our current procedures.

**Recommendations for Continued Operations**

I recommend maintaining our current waste disposal procedures as they continue to provide cost-effective and operationally efficient management of chemical byproducts. The system established during the Riley family ownership period has functioned reliably for over fifty years without significant operational problems. Any modifications to these established procedures would require substantial capital investment in alternative disposal infrastructure while potentially disrupting our production capabilities and increasing operational costs significantly.

The integration of Riley Tannery operations into the broader Beatrice Foods corporate structure should proceed with minimal changes to these fundamental operational systems that have proven their effectiveness over decades of continuous use. Our current procedures align with standard industry practices throughout the Massachusetts leather manufacturing sector and provide the operational reliability necessary to support Beatrice Foods' commitment to consistent product supply and competitive pricing.
