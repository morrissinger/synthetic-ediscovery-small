# WORK ORDER - CHEMICAL WASTE DRUM PLACEMENT
## RIVERSIDE PROPERTY SITE

**TO:** Riley Company Work Crew - Team Alpha  
**FROM:** J. Sullivan, Site Foreman  
**DATE:** July 19, 1971  
**TIME:** 08:45 Hours  
**JOB NO:** RIL-071971-CWD  

### SITE LOCATION AND ACCESS
Proceed to the riverside property located approximately 800 yards northeast of the main Cryovac facility on Olympia Avenue. Access the site via the service road behind the main plant building - follow the gravel path that runs parallel to the Aberjona River until you reach the designated disposal area marked by the orange survey stakes installed last week.

The site coordinates are approximately 200 feet from the riverbank on the elevated section above the flood plain. Look for the cleared area where we've been placing materials since May. The area should be clearly visible - it's the section where the vegetation has been removed and the ground has been prepared with the lime treatment.

### DRUM SPECIFICATIONS AND HANDLING
This morning's delivery consists of forty-seven (47) steel drums, each containing approximately 55 gallons of chemical waste materials from the Cryovac production line cleaning operations. The drums are marked with production codes CRY-071971-A through CRY-071971-AV and contain solvents used in the vinyl film manufacturing process.

**IMPORTANT:** Handle all drums with standard industrial gloves. Some drums may show minor surface corrosion or small leaks around the rim seals. This is normal for these materials. If you encounter any drum with significant damage or active leaking, set it aside from the main placement area but do not attempt repairs in the field.

Use the mechanical lift truck to transport drums from the staging area to the placement site. Do not attempt to roll or manually carry the full drums due to their weight (approximately 400 pounds each when full).

### PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
Begin drum placement in the northeastern section of the prepared area, working in rows from north to south. Space drums approximately three feet apart to allow for future access if needed. Place drums directly on the prepared ground surface - no additional foundation preparation is required for this placement.

Arrange drums in orderly rows of eight drums each, with clear pathways between rows for equipment access. The site has been surveyed and can accommodate up to sixty drums in the current configuration, so today's placement of forty-seven drums will leave capacity for future deliveries.

**Critical:** Ensure all drums are placed at least 150 feet from the riverbank to maintain compliance with our standard setback requirements. The orange stakes mark the minimum distance boundary - do not place any materials beyond this line toward the river.

### DOCUMENTATION AND COMPLETION
Upon completion of drum placement, record the final position of all drums on the site diagram provided with this work order. Note any drums that show damage or require special attention in the remarks section of the completion report.

Complete the standard work completion form (Form RIL-47) and submit to the main office by end of shift today. Include total drum count, placement completion time, and any issues encountered during the operation.

The site does not require immediate covering or additional treatment at this time. Future disposal operations will be scheduled based on the capacity remaining after today's placement.

### SAFETY REMINDERS
- Maintain standard safety protocols for industrial waste handling
- Ensure all personnel wear appropriate protective equipment
- Keep the work area clear of unauthorized personnel
- Report any unusual odors or visible emissions immediately to the foreman
- Do not smoke or use open flames within 100 feet of the placement area

### WEATHER CONSIDERATIONS
Current forecast shows clear conditions through the afternoon. If weather conditions change and precipitation begins, secure the work area and return to the main facility. Do not continue drum placement operations during active rainfall to prevent runoff issues.

Ground conditions at the site are currently firm and suitable for equipment operation. The recent dry weather has improved access conditions significantly compared to the muddy conditions we encountered in May and June.

### COMPLETION TIMELINE
This placement operation should be completed by 1500 hours today. If any delays are encountered due to equipment issues or site conditions, contact the main office immediately at MAyfair 4-7821 to report status and receive further instructions.

Upon completion, return all equipment to the main yard and secure the site access road. Ensure the gate chain is properly locked and the "No Trespassing - Riley Company Operations" sign remains clearly posted.
