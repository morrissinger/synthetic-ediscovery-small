## **Opening Remarks**

Meeting called to order at 3:45 PM. Mr. Schlichtmann opened by expressing condolences to the Anderson family for the loss of James Anderson on January 18, 1981, and acknowledged the ongoing medical battles faced by the other affected children. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss legal strategy options and establish a coordinated approach to potential litigation against the corporate defendants responsible for the contamination of municipal Wells G and H.

## **Case Overview and Evidence Summary**

Mr. Schlichtmann provided a comprehensive review of the evidence gathered to date:

**Water Contamination Facts:**
- Wells G and H opened in 1964 and 1966 respectively, serving the affected neighborhood throughout the relevant exposure period
- Trichloroethylene (TCE) concentrations documented at 400 parts per billion in well water samples - 148 times the level associated with one additional cancer case per million exposed individuals
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) detected at 43 parts per billion
- Both chemicals are documented carcinogens with particular toxicity to developing children

**Affected Children and Families:**
- James Anderson: Diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia January 1972 (age 3), deceased January 18, 1981 (age 12)
- Kevin Kane Jr.: Currently undergoing treatment for leukemia
- Michael Zona: Diagnosed with leukemia, treatment ongoing
- Patrick Toomey: Leukemia diagnosis, medical treatment continuing
- Carl Robbins III: Childhood leukemia case
- Roland Gamache: Affected child in the cluster

**Corporate Defendants Identified:**
- W.R. Grace Company and its subsidiary Cryovac Inc. - Industrial facility operations adjacent to well field
- Beatrice Foods - Manufacturing operations with documented solvent disposal
- John J. Riley Company - Tannery operations with chemical waste disposal practices

## **Legal Theory Discussion**

**Negligence Claims:**
Mr. Conway outlined the negligence framework applicable to each defendant corporation. The elements of negligence - duty of care, breach of that duty, causation, and damages - can be established through the following evidence:

1. **Duty of Care:** Industrial operators have a legal obligation to prevent contamination of municipal water supplies
2. **Breach:** Improper disposal of industrial solvents constituted a breach of reasonable care standards
3. **Causation:** Medical evidence linking TCE/PCE exposure to childhood leukemia, combined with timing of well operations and diagnoses
4. **Damages:** Medical expenses, pain and suffering, and in the Anderson case, wrongful death

**Wrongful Death Action (Anderson Family):**
The Anderson wrongful death claim presents the strongest foundation for the litigation. James Anderson's nine-year battle with leukemia, from diagnosis in 1972 until death in 1981, occurred entirely during the period when Wells G and H were supplying contaminated water to the Anderson residence at 11 Orange Street. Anne Anderson's seventeen years of residence at the property establishes long-term exposure patterns affecting prenatal development, infancy, and childhood.

## **Family Statements and Testimony**

**Anne Anderson** provided detailed testimony regarding James's medical history and the family's water usage patterns. She emphasized that all household water came from the municipal supply, including drinking water, food preparation, and bathing. She noted that neither Christine Anderson (born 1962) nor Charles Anderson (born 1966) developed leukemia, but both were exposed to the same contaminated water supply.

**Donna Robbins** described Carl Robbins III's ongoing medical treatment and the financial burden on the family. She confirmed exclusive reliance on municipal water at their residence.

**Patricia Kane** detailed Kevin Kane Jr.'s current condition and treatment regimen. She expressed particular concern about the clustering of cases in their neighborhood and the apparent connection to the municipal water supply.

**Michael Zona Sr.** provided information about his son's diagnosis and treatment, emphasizing the family's complete dependence on Wells G and H water supply.

**Mary Toomey** described Patrick's medical situation and the family's mounting medical expenses.

**Roland Gamache Sr.** provided details about his son's case and confirmed the family's water usage patterns consistent with municipal supply dependency.

## **Regulatory and Government Agency Involvement**

Discussion of coordination with ongoing EPA investigation and Massachusetts Department of Public Health studies. The agencies have documented the contamination but have not yet taken definitive action against the responsible corporations. Mr. Schlichtmann emphasized that civil litigation may proceed independently of regulatory enforcement actions.

## **Medical Expert Consultation**

Plans were discussed for retaining medical experts in pediatric oncology and environmental health to establish the causal relationship between TCE/PCE exposure and childhood leukemia. Expert testimony will be crucial for establishing the timing and duration of exposure necessary to cause the observed health effects.

## **Financial Considerations**

Mr. Schlichtmann outlined the significant costs associated with environmental litigation against major corporations. The firm is prepared to advance costs for expert witnesses, medical records review, environmental testing, and discovery proceedings. Contingency fee arrangements were discussed with all families.

## **Decisions Made**

1. **Authorization to File Suit:** All attending families authorized the filing of civil litigation against the identified corporate defendants
2. **Lead Plaintiff Designation:** Anne Anderson designated as lead plaintiff given the wrongful death claim
3. **Medical Records Release:** All families agreed to comprehensive medical records release for expert review
4. **Coordination Agreement:** Families agreed to coordinate all media contact through the law firm
5. **Discovery Cooperation:** All families committed to full cooperation with discovery proceedings

## **Action Items**

**For Legal Counsel:**
- File complaint within 30 days of this meeting
- Retain medical experts in pediatric oncology and environmental health
- Coordinate with EPA and state health department investigations
- Begin document discovery process with corporate defendants
- Schedule depositions of family members and treating physicians

**For Families:**
- Compile comprehensive medical records for all affected children
- Prepare detailed timelines of residence and water usage
- Maintain detailed records of ongoing medical expenses
- Avoid independent contact with corporate representatives or media

## **Next Meeting**

Next family meeting scheduled for January 15, 1982, at 2:00 PM to review complaint filing and initial discovery responses.

## **Adjournment**

Meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.
