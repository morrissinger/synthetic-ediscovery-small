## MAINTENANCE NOTES

### **Equipment Condition Assessment**

**Vacuum Chamber Units:**
- Unit #1: Operating within normal parameters, minor seal wear noted
- Unit #2: Pressure readings slightly low, scheduled for seal replacement
- Unit #3: Normal operation, no issues observed  
- Unit #4: Temperature control requires calibration adjustment

**Heat Sealing Stations:**
All stations operating satisfactorily following cleaning. Temperature consistency improved after solvent cleaning of heating elements.

**Conveyor Systems:**
Belt tracking corrected during cleaning operation. Lubrication points serviced. No mechanical issues identified.

### **Solvent Effectiveness**

TCE proved most effective for vacuum chamber cleaning, removing all residual packaging material and adhesive buildup. PCE worked well on heat sealing station components. Methylene chloride effectively removed conveyor belt contamination. Industrial degreasing compound adequate for film feeding mechanism maintenance.
