## HEMATOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

### Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential

| Parameter | Result | Reference Range (Age 8) | Units | Flag |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------|-------|------|
| **White Blood Cell Count** | **47,200** | **4,500-13,500** | **/μL** | **CRITICAL HIGH** |
| Red Blood Cell Count | 3.2 | 4.0-5.2 | million/μL | Low |
| Hemoglobin | 8.4 | 11.5-15.5 | g/dL | Low |
| Hematocrit | 24.8 | 35-45 | % | Low |
| Mean Corpuscular Volume | 77.5 | 80-100 | fL | Low |
| Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin | 26.3 | 27-31 | pg | Low |
| Platelet Count | 89,000 | 150,000-450,000 | /μL | Low |

### White Blood Cell Differential Count

| Cell Type | Percentage | Absolute Count | Reference Range | Flag |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| **Blasts** | **78%** | **36,816/μL** | **0%** | **CRITICAL** |
| Lymphocytes | 15% | 7,080/μL | 20-40% | Low |
| Neutrophils | 5% | 2,360/μL | 45-70% | Critical Low |
| Monocytes | 2% | 944/μL | 2-8% | Normal |
| Eosinophils | 0% | 0/μL | 1-4% | Low |
| Basophils | 0% | 0/μL | 0-1% | Normal |

## MORPHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS

**Red Blood Cell Morphology:**
- Moderate anisocytosis
- Mild hypochromia
- Occasional target cells
- No schistocytes observed

**White Blood Cell Morphology:**
- **CRITICAL FINDING:** Numerous immature blast cells present
- Blasts demonstrate large nuclei with fine chromatin pattern
- Multiple nucleoli visible in blast population
- Scant basophilic cytoplasm in blast cells
- Auer rods: **NOT OBSERVED**
- Few mature neutrophils with normal morphology

**Platelet Morphology:**
- Decreased platelet count confirmed on smear
- Normal platelet morphology where present
- No platelet clumping observed

## CLINICAL INTERPRETATION

**CRITICAL ABNORMAL FINDINGS:**

1. **Severe Leukocytosis:** WBC count of 47,200/μL represents extreme elevation, approximately 3.5 times the upper normal limit for age group.

2. **Blast Crisis:** 78% blast cells (36,816/μL absolute count) indicates acute leukemic process. Normal blast count should be 0%.

3. **Pancytopenia of Mature Elements:** Despite elevated total WBC, patient demonstrates:
   - Severe neutropenia (2,360/μL) - critical immunocompromised state
   - Moderate anemia (Hgb 8.4 g/dL)
   - Thrombocytopenia (89,000/μL) - bleeding risk

## RECOMMENDATIONS

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **Notify attending physician STAT** - Critical values reported to Dr. Chen at 14:45 PM on 08/22/79
2. **Consider immediate hematology consultation** if not already involved
3. **Bone marrow biopsy recommended** for definitive diagnosis and classification
4. **Flow cytometry analysis** should be considered if available
5. **Coagulation studies** recommended given thrombocytopenia
6. **Blood culture** recommended given severe neutropenia

**CLINICAL CORRELATION:**

The constellation of findings—extreme leukocytosis with predominant blast population, coupled with anemia and thrombocytopenia—is highly suggestive of **acute leukemia**. The morphological characteristics of the blast cells require further characterization through bone marrow examination and specialized studies to determine lineage (lymphoid vs. myeloid) and specific subtype.

Given the patient's age (8 years) and the acute presentation, **acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)** should be strongly considered in the differential diagnosis, though acute myeloid leukemia cannot be excluded without additional studies.

**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:**
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (most likely)
- Acute myeloid leukemia
- Lymphoblastic lymphoma with leukemic presentation
- Aplastic anemia with transformation (less likely given blast count)

## QUALITY CONTROL

**Instrument Calibration:** Coulter Counter Model S-Plus calibrated 08/22/79 at 06:00 AM  
**Control Results:** All controls within acceptable limits  
**Differential Count:** 200-cell manual differential performed  
**Slide Review:** Confirmed by senior technologist J. Morrison, MT(ASCP)  

**Technical Notes:**
- Sample processed within 2 hours of collection
- No interfering substances detected
- Repeat analysis confirmed initial results
- Peripheral smear prepared and stained with Wright-Giemsa
