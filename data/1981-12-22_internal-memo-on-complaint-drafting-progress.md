# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Jan Schlichtmann  
**FROM:** Attorney Roisman  
**DATE:** December 22, 1981  
**RE:** Progress Report on Anderson v. W.R. Grace et al. Complaint Drafting

Jan,

I wanted to provide you with an update on the complaint drafting for the Anderson matter before we break for the holidays. As you know, we've been working intensively since James Anderson's death in January to build a comprehensive case against the defendants we've identified as responsible for the groundwater contamination in East Woburn.

**Current Status of Complaint Development**

The complaint is approximately 75% complete, with the factual allegations section substantially finished. I've incorporated the extensive documentation we've gathered regarding the contamination of Wells G and H, including the EPA's findings of trichloroethylene concentrations up to 400 parts per billion and tetrachloroethylene at 43 parts per billion. The chronology clearly establishes that these wells served the Anderson residence at 11 Orange Street throughout James's entire life, from 1968 until his death this past January.

We've structured the complaint to name four primary defendants: W.R. Grace Company and its subsidiary Cryovac Inc., Beatrice Foods, and John J. Riley Company. Each defendant's industrial operations and waste disposal practices have been documented through our investigation, and I believe we have sufficient evidence to establish their respective contributions to the contamination plume that affected the municipal water supply.

**Plaintiff Class Expansion**

Anne Anderson remains our lead plaintiff, but we're also preparing to include the families of the other affected children. The pattern is unmistakable - Kevin Kane Jr., Michael Zona, Patrick Toomey, Carl Robbins III, and Roland Gamache all lived in the same area served by Wells G and H, and all developed leukemia during the period when the wells were operational. The epidemiological evidence strongly supports our theory that the contaminated water supply caused this cluster of childhood leukemia cases.

I've been working closely with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health records to establish the timeline and medical documentation for each case. The fact that James was diagnosed in January 1972, just six years after Well H came online in 1966, provides compelling evidence of the causal relationship we need to prove.

**Outstanding Legal Research**

There are still several areas where we need additional research before filing. First, we need to finalize our approach to municipal liability - whether to include the City of Woburn as a defendant or potential third-party defendant. The city's decision to continue operating Wells G and H despite early warning signs may constitute negligence, but we need to be strategic about not alienating the very community we're trying to help.

Second, we're still analyzing the complex corporate structures, particularly regarding Beatrice Foods' ownership and operational control during the relevant time periods. The Riley tannery operations present some challenges in terms of establishing the timeline of their waste disposal practices and the specific chemicals they contributed to the contamination.

**Next Steps**

I recommend we schedule a strategy session for the first week of January to review the complete draft complaint and finalize our filing strategy. We should also discuss whether to file in state or federal court - the diversity of defendants and the interstate nature of their operations may give us better leverage in federal court, but state court might be more sympathetic to our local plaintiffs.

The scientific evidence continues to strengthen our position. The EPA's ongoing investigation is providing additional documentation of the contamination sources, and the health department's epidemiological review supports our causation arguments. I believe we have a strong foundation for what will undoubtedly be a complex and lengthy litigation.

Please let me know if you need any additional details before our holiday break. Anne Anderson has been remarkably patient and strong throughout this process, but I know she's eager to see formal action taken against the companies responsible for her son's death.

Best regards,

Attorney Roisman
