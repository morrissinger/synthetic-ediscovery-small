## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The John J. Riley Company completed its twentieth year of operation with robust production figures and continued expansion of our leather processing capabilities. Our facility at 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, processed 47,250 raw hides during the fiscal year, representing a 12% increase over the previous year's production of 42,150 hides. This growth reflects both increased demand for our premium leather goods and successful implementation of enhanced processing techniques.

Our chemical procurement and usage reached new operational levels to support this expanded production, with particular increases in chromium compounds, sodium sulfide, and various organic solvents essential to modern leather processing. The company maintained its commitment to efficient operations while managing the increased volume of processing byproducts and waste materials generated by our expanded activities.

- August: 4,200 hides
- September: 4,050 hides
- October: 3,800 hides
- November: 3,650 hides
- December: 3,825 hides

### Quality Control and Processing Standards

Our leather finishing achieved consistently high standards, with rejection rates maintained below 3.2% throughout the year. The implementation of improved chemical treatment protocols contributed to enhanced hide preservation and superior final product quality. Our chromium tanning process, now fully integrated into all production lines, produces leather of exceptional durability and commercial value.

## CHEMICAL USAGE AND PROCUREMENT

### Primary Chemical Compounds

The expansion of our operations necessitated substantial increases in chemical procurement across all categories essential to leather processing:

**Chromium Compounds:**
- Chromium sulfate: 28,450 pounds (increase of 18% over 1928)
- Chrome alum: 12,200 pounds
- Total chromium-based compounds: 40,650 pounds

**Sodium Compounds:**
- Sodium sulfide: 35,800 pounds
- Sodium chloride: 22,100 pounds
- Sodium carbonate: 18,650 pounds

**Organic Solvents and Cleaning Agents:**
- Trichloroethylene: 8,950 gallons (new procurement for enhanced degreasing operations)
- Perchloroethylene: 4,200 gallons
- Various petroleum-based solvents: 6,800 gallons
- Industrial cleaning compounds: 3,400 gallons

**Acids and Alkaline Solutions:**
- Sulfuric acid: 15,600 gallons
- Hydrochloric acid: 8,200 gallons
- Lime solutions: 45,200 pounds

### Chemical Storage and Handling

Our expanded chemical storage facilities, constructed in early 1929, provide adequate capacity for increased inventory levels. The new concrete storage area adjacent to the main processing building accommodates bulk chemical deliveries and maintains proper segregation of incompatible compounds. Regular deliveries from suppliers including Merrimac Chemical Company and Boston Industrial Supply ensure continuous availability of essential processing materials.

## WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OPERATIONS

### Liquid Waste Processing

The increased production volume generated corresponding increases in liquid waste requiring proper disposal. Our settling ponds, expanded in 1928, processed approximately 2.8 million gallons of liquid waste containing various chemical residues from hide processing operations. The settling system effectively separates solid materials from liquid effluent before discharge to the adjacent drainage areas.

**Liquid Waste Categories:**
- Chromium-bearing solutions from tanning operations
- Spent acid solutions from pickling processes  
- Alkaline waste from liming operations
- Solvent-contaminated rinse water from degreasing
- General process water containing various chemical residues

### Solid Waste Disposal

Solid waste materials, including hide trimmings, sludge from settling operations, and spent chemical compounds, totaled approximately 1,850 tons during the fiscal year. These materials were disposed of through various methods including burial in designated areas of our property and removal by contracted waste hauling services.

The company maintains its longstanding practice of utilizing available land areas for waste disposal, taking advantage of the natural absorption capacity of local soil conditions. This approach provides cost-effective waste management while making productive use of otherwise unutilized portions of our property.

## OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND COST MANAGEMENT

### Chemical Cost Analysis

Total chemical procurement costs reached $47,350 for the fiscal year, representing 14.2% of gross production costs. While this figure shows an increase over previous years, the cost per processed hide remained stable due to improved processing efficiency and bulk purchasing agreements with our primary suppliers.

The introduction of more concentrated chemical formulations reduced handling costs and storage requirements while maintaining processing effectiveness. Our partnership with regional chemical suppliers ensures competitive pricing and reliable delivery schedules essential to continuous operations.

### Facility Maintenance and Improvements

Significant facility improvements completed during 1929 include expansion of our chemical storage capacity, installation of additional processing equipment, and enhancement of our waste settling pond system. These improvements position the company for continued growth while maintaining operational efficiency.

The proximity of our facility to transportation infrastructure, including the railroad spur serving our property and convenient road access, continues to provide competitive advantages in raw material procurement and finished product distribution.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS

### Municipal Coordination

The John J. Riley Company maintains cooperative relationships with Woburn municipal authorities and continues to operate in full compliance with applicable local regulations governing industrial operations. Our facility contributes significantly to local employment and economic activity while maintaining responsible operational practices.

Regular communication with municipal officials ensures awareness of our operations and continued cooperation in matters affecting both the company and the broader East Woburn community. The company's twenty-year presence in the area demonstrates our commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen.

### Environmental Considerations

Our waste management practices reflect industry-standard approaches to handling the byproducts of leather processing operations. The natural filtration capacity of local soil conditions provides effective treatment of liquid waste materials, while our settling pond system ensures proper handling of process water before discharge.

The company recognizes the importance of responsible waste management and continues to evaluate methods for improving the efficiency of our disposal operations. Our current practices represent proven approaches developed through two decades of successful operation.

## PROJECTIONS AND STRATEGIC PLANNING
