# COST ANALYSIS OF CURRENT SOLVENT DISPOSAL METHODS VS PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS

**W.R. GRACE COMPANY**  
**INTERNAL FINANCIAL ANALYSIS REPORT**

**TO:** Operations Director  
**FROM:** Richard M. Patterson, Financial Analyst  
**DATE:** November 30, 1977  
**RE:** Cost-Benefit Analysis of Solvent Disposal Methodology Improvements

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents a comprehensive financial analysis comparing our current solvent disposal practices at the Cryovac Division facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, with proposed environmental compliance improvements recommended by the Engineering Department. The analysis covers projected costs for the five-year period 1978-1982, incorporating capital expenditures, operational modifications, and regulatory compliance factors.

**Key Findings:**
- Current disposal methods: $47,200 annually
- Proposed improvements: $312,000 initial capital + $89,400 annually
- Break-even point: 8.2 years
- Regulatory compliance risk mitigation value: Unquantified but significant

## CURRENT DISPOSAL METHODOLOGY

### Operational Overview

Our Woburn facility currently processes approximately 240,000 gallons of industrial solvents annually, primarily consisting of trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and related chlorinated compounds used in the plastic film manufacturing process. The current disposal system, implemented in 1964, utilizes on-site lagoons and direct discharge methods that have proven cost-effective from a purely operational standpoint.

### Current Cost Structure

**Annual Operating Costs (1977 basis):**
- Lagoon maintenance and monitoring: $18,400
- Chemical handling and processing: $12,800
- Labor allocation (0.5 FTE): $11,200
- Equipment maintenance: $4,800
- **Total Annual Cost: $47,200**

This methodology has maintained consistent cost performance over the past thirteen years, with inflation-adjusted increases averaging 4.2% annually. The system requires minimal specialized equipment and leverages existing site infrastructure, including the natural depression areas on the northeastern portion of the property.

### Operational Efficiency Metrics

The current system processes waste solvents at a unit cost of $0.197 per gallon, significantly below industry averages of $0.340-$0.450 per gallon for comparable operations. This cost advantage has contributed approximately $68,000 annually to divisional profitability since 1970, representing a cumulative benefit of $476,000 over the seven-year period.

## PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM

### Engineering Specifications

The Engineering Department has submitted specifications for a closed-loop solvent recovery and disposal system incorporating the following components:

**Primary Infrastructure:**
- Solvent recovery distillation unit (capacity: 50 gallons/hour)
- Closed-circuit collection system with underground piping
- Secondary containment structures for all storage areas
- Vapor recovery and treatment system
- Automated monitoring and control systems

**Environmental Compliance Features:**
- EPA-compliant storage tanks with double-wall construction
- Groundwater monitoring well network (12 wells at 50-foot intervals)
- Soil vapor extraction system for contaminated areas
- Emergency response equipment and containment materials

### Capital Investment Requirements

**Initial Capital Expenditure (1978 implementation):**
- Solvent recovery equipment: $145,000
- Site preparation and construction: $78,000
- Monitoring well installation: $34,000
- Piping and electrical systems: $29,000
- Contingency and project management (15%): $46,800
- **Total Capital Investment: $332,800**

**Financing Options:**
The capital requirement can be accommodated through:
1. Internal cash flow allocation from divisional operations
2. Corporate capital budget allocation (recommended)
3. Equipment financing at current rates (11.5% for 60-month term)

### Operational Cost Analysis

**Revised Annual Operating Costs:**
- Equipment operation and maintenance: $34,600
- Increased labor requirements (1.2 FTE): $26,880
- Monitoring and compliance activities: $18,200
- Utilities and consumables: $9,720
- **Total Annual Operating Cost: $89,400**

The proposed system increases annual operating costs by $42,200 (89% increase) but provides significant operational improvements including 70% solvent recovery rates and enhanced environmental compliance positioning.

## FINANCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Five-Year Cost Comparison

**Current System Projection (1978-1982):**
- Year 1: $49,100 (4% inflation adjustment)
- Year 2: $51,100
- Year 3: $53,100
- Year 4: $55,200
- Year 5: $57,400
- **Five-Year Total: $265,900**

**Proposed System Projection (1978-1982):**
- Capital Investment (1978): $332,800
- Year 1 Operating: $89,400
- Year 2 Operating: $93,000
- Year 3 Operating: $96,700
- Year 4 Operating: $100,600
- Year 5 Operating: $104,600
- **Five-Year Total: $717,100**

**Net Additional Investment: $451,200 over five years**

### Break-Even Analysis

Based on current cost trajectories and assuming 4% annual inflation, the proposed system would achieve cost parity with existing methods after 8.2 years of operation. However, this analysis excludes potential regulatory compliance costs, environmental remediation liabilities, and reputational risk factors that could significantly alter the financial equation.

### Solvent Recovery Benefits

The proposed system's 70% recovery rate would generate approximately 168,000 gallons of recovered solvents annually, valued at current market rates of $1.85 per gallon. This represents $310,800 in annual recovered value, substantially offsetting the increased operational costs and providing a positive cash flow contribution of $221,400 annually after operating expenses.

**Revised Break-Even Analysis (Including Recovery Value):**
With solvent recovery benefits included, the system achieves positive cash flow in Year 2 and full payback by Year 3 of operation.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### Current Regulatory Environment

The regulatory landscape for industrial solvent disposal has evolved significantly since our current system's implementation. The Environmental Protection Agency's increasing focus on groundwater protection and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering's enhanced monitoring requirements suggest that continued operation under current methodologies may face regulatory challenges.

### Compliance Risk Assessment

**Potential Regulatory Costs:**
- Groundwater remediation (estimated): $500,000-$2,000,000
- Regulatory fines and penalties: $50,000-$200,000 annually
- Mandatory system upgrades: $400,000-$800,000
- Legal and consulting fees: $75,000-$150,000

The proposed improvement system would substantially reduce these regulatory exposure risks while positioning the facility for compliance with anticipated future requirements.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Primary Recommendation

**Implement the proposed solvent disposal improvement system in Q2 1978.** The financial analysis, when incorporating solvent recovery benefits and regulatory risk mitigation, strongly supports this investment despite the significant initial capital requirement.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1 (Q2 1978):** Begin construction of primary infrastructure and monitoring systems
2. **Phase 2 (Q3 1978):** Install solvent recovery equipment and testing systems
3. **Phase 3 (Q4 1978):** Commission system and begin operational transition
4. **Phase 4 (Q1 1979):** Complete transition and optimize operational parameters

### Alternative Considerations

If capital constraints prevent full implementation, a phased approach prioritizing the monitoring well network and secondary containment systems could provide interim compliance improvements at 35% of total capital cost, while preserving the option for full system implementation in 1979-1980.

### Financial Approval Requirements

The $332,800 capital investment requires Corporate Executive Committee approval under current authorization limits. I recommend scheduling presentation to the December 15, 1977 Executive Committee meeting to ensure Q2 1978 implementation timeline viability.
