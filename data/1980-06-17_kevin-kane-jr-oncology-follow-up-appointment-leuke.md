## CHIEF COMPLAINT

Six-month follow-up examination for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete remission. Patient presents for routine monitoring of hematologic status and assessment of treatment response.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Kevin Kane Jr. is a 12-year-old white male who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in September 1978 at age 10. Initial presentation included fatigue, pallor, petechial rash, and hepatosplenomegaly. Diagnostic workup revealed blast cells comprising 89% of bone marrow cellularity with L1 morphology per FAB classification. Cerebrospinal fluid examination was negative for leukemic involvement.

The patient was enrolled in our modified BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster) protocol and achieved complete remission following induction chemotherapy with vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, and daunorubicin. He subsequently received consolidation therapy and is currently in the maintenance phase of treatment, receiving oral methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine with monthly vincristine and prednisone pulses.

Patient's father reports that Kevin has been feeling well with good energy levels and appetite. He has returned to school full-time and participates in limited physical activities. No recent infections, bleeding episodes, or concerning symptoms. Compliance with oral medications has been excellent per parental report.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, diagnosed September 1978
- Pneumococcal pneumonia, treated January 1979 during neutropenic episode
- Multiple episodes of mucositis during intensive chemotherapy phases
- No other significant medical history prior to leukemia diagnosis
- No known allergies to medications

## FAMILY HISTORY

Parents report no family history of malignancy or hematologic disorders. Of note, the family has resided at their current address in East Woburn since 1965, with municipal water supply from local wells. Father works as a machinist at a local manufacturing plant. Mother is a homemaker.

## SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient lives with both parents and one younger sister in East Woburn. Attends John F. Kennedy Middle School with modified schedule during treatment periods. Previously active in Little League baseball; currently restricted from contact sports per oncology recommendations.

- Pulse: 88 bpm, regular
- Respirations: 18/min
- Blood pressure: 102/65 mmHg
- Weight: 78 lbs (35.4 kg) - 25th percentile for age
- Height: 58 inches (147 cm) - 50th percentile for age

**General Appearance:** Well-appearing, alert, cooperative 12-year-old male in no acute distress. Mild cushingoid features secondary to corticosteroid therapy.

**HEENT:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. Conjunctivae pink, no pallor. Oral mucosa intact without ulcerations. No lymphadenopathy palpable in cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary regions.

**Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

**Pulmonary:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

**Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Liver edge palpable 1 cm below right costal margin, which represents decrease from 3 cm at diagnosis. Spleen not palpable, previously enlarged to 2 cm below left costal margin at diagnosis.

**Extremities:** No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. No petechiae or ecchymoses noted.

**Neurologic:** Alert and oriented x3, cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact, motor strength 5/5 throughout, reflexes symmetric.

## LABORATORY RESULTS

**Complete Blood Count with Differential (drawn 6/17/80):**
- White Blood Cell Count: 4,200/μL (normal range: 4,000-10,000)
- Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL (normal range: 11.5-15.5)
- Hematocrit: 35.2% (normal range: 35-45)
- Platelet Count: 185,000/μL (normal range: 150,000-400,000)
- Absolute Neutrophil Count: 2,520/μL
- Lymphocytes: 35%
- Monocytes: 8%
- Eosinophils: 2%
- Basophils: 1%

**Comprehensive Metabolic Panel:**
- All values within normal limits for age
- Liver function tests normal (AST 28 U/L, ALT 24 U/L)
- Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL (normal for age)

**Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy (performed 6/10/80):**
- Cellularity: 60% (normal for age)
- Blast cells: <1% (consistent with complete remission)
- Trilineage maturation present
- No evidence of residual leukemia

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

**Primary Diagnosis:** Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in complete remission

Kevin continues to demonstrate excellent response to therapy with sustained complete remission now approaching 22 months from initial diagnosis. Current hematologic parameters are within normal range, and bone marrow examination confirms continued absence of leukemic cells.

**Plan:**
1. **Continue current maintenance chemotherapy regimen:**
   - Oral methotrexate 20 mg/m² weekly (15 mg weekly for patient)
   - 6-mercaptopurine 75 mg/m² daily (50 mg daily for patient)
   - Monthly vincristine 1.5 mg/m² IV (1 mg for patient) and prednisone 40 mg/m² x 5 days

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Monthly CBC with differential
   - Quarterly comprehensive metabolic panel and liver function tests
   - Bone marrow examination every six months or as clinically indicated
   - Next appointment scheduled for August 15, 1980

3. **Supportive care:**
   - Continue PCP prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
   - Maintain current activity restrictions (no contact sports)
   - Immediate medical attention for fever >101°F or signs of infection

4. **Patient/family education:**
   - Reviewed signs and symptoms requiring immediate medical attention
   - Importance of medication compliance emphasized
   - School notification regarding immunocompromised status

**Prognosis:** Excellent. Patient has demonstrated sustained complete remission with good tolerance of maintenance therapy. Current plan is to continue treatment through September 1981, representing three years of total therapy duration per protocol guidelines.

**Next Follow-up:** August 15, 1980 at 2:30 PM
