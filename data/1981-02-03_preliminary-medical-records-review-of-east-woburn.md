# Preliminary Medical Records Review of East Woburn Leukemia Cases

**Massachusetts Department of Public Health**  
**Division of Environmental Health Assessment**  
**150 Tremont Street, Boston, MA 02111**

**Report No:** MDPH-EHA-81-0203  
**Date:** February 3, 1981  
**Prepared by:** Dr. Sarah Mitchell, M.D., M.P.H.  
**Classification:** Preliminary Assessment  

## Abstract

This preliminary assessment examines medical records and demographic data related to reported childhood leukemia cases in the East Woburn area of Woburn, Massachusetts. Initial review suggests a potential cluster of acute lymphocytic leukemia cases among children residing in proximity to municipal Wells G and H. Further epidemiological investigation is warranted to determine statistical significance and potential environmental factors.

## Introduction

On January 20, 1981, this department received a formal inquiry from Mrs. Anne Anderson of 11 Orange Street, Woburn, regarding what she described as an unusual number of childhood leukemia cases in her neighborhood. Mrs. Anderson's son, James Anderson, died of acute lymphocytic leukemia on January 18, 1981, after a nine-year battle with the disease. Her inquiry prompted this preliminary review of available medical records and vital statistics for the East Woburn area.

The purpose of this assessment is to:
1. Determine if a statistically significant cluster of childhood leukemia cases exists
2. Identify common demographic and geographic characteristics among affected families
3. Recommend appropriate follow-up investigations if warranted

## Methodology

### Case Definition
For this preliminary review, cases were defined as:
- Diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)
- Age at diagnosis: 0-19 years
- Residence in East Woburn at time of diagnosis
- Diagnosis date: January 1970 - January 1981

### Data Sources
- Massachusetts Cancer Registry records
- Hospital discharge records from Massachusetts General Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston
- Vital statistics records, City of Woburn
- Municipal water system records

### Geographic Boundaries
The study area was defined as the East Woburn neighborhood, bounded by:
- North: Montvale Avenue
- South: Washington Street
- East: Burlington town line
- West: Mishawum Road

This area is primarily served by municipal Wells G and H, which began operation in 1964 and 1966 respectively.

## Findings

### Case Identification

**Confirmed Cases (n=8):**

1. **James Anderson** - DOB: July 16, 1968; Address: 11 Orange Street
   - Diagnosed: January 1972 (age 3)
   - Died: January 18, 1981 (age 12)
   - Water source: Wells G and H

2. **Kevin Kane Jr.** - DOB: March 22, 1963; Address: 43 Pine Street
   - Diagnosed: August 1970 (age 7)
   - Status: Deceased, 1973
   - Water source: Wells G and H

3. **Michael Zona** - DOB: September 14, 1966; Address: 19 Maple Street
   - Diagnosed: May 1974 (age 7)
   - Status: In remission as of December 1980
   - Water source: Wells G and H

4. **Patrick Toomey** - DOB: June 8, 1969; Address: 267 East Street
   - Diagnosed: March 1976 (age 6)
   - Status: Active treatment
   - Water source: Wells G and H

5. **Carl Robbins III** - DOB: November 30, 1965; Address: 15 Forest Street
   - Diagnosed: September 1973 (age 7)
   - Status: Deceased, 1974
   - Water source: Wells G and H

6. **Roland Gamache** - DOB: April 12, 1964; Address: 52 Trinity Avenue
   - Diagnosed: June 1971 (age 7)
   - Status: In remission as of January 1981
   - Water source: Wells G and H

7. **[Additional case under review]** - DOB: February 1967; Address: Salem Street
   - Diagnosed: October 1975 (age 8)
   - Status: Active treatment
   - Water source: Wells G and H

8. **[Additional case under review]** - DOB: August 1970; Address: Cross Street
   - Diagnosed: January 1978 (age 7)
   - Status: In remission
   - Water source: Wells G and H

### Statistical Analysis

**Incidence Rate Calculation:**
- Study population (ages 0-19): Approximately 3,200 children
- Observed cases: 8 confirmed cases over 11-year period
- Expected cases (based on Massachusetts average): 1.2 cases
- **Relative Risk: 6.67** (95% CI: 2.8-13.1)

**Geographic Distribution:**
All confirmed cases resided within 0.5 miles of Wells G and H. No cases were identified in West Woburn areas served by different water sources.

**Temporal Distribution:**
- Peak diagnosis years: 1971-1976 (6 of 8 cases)
- Median age at diagnosis: 7 years
- Male to female ratio: 5:3

### Environmental Factors

**Municipal Water Supply:**
- Wells G and H serve approximately 70% of East Woburn residents
- Well G: Operational since May 1964, depth 180 feet
- Well H: Operational since October 1966, depth 400 feet
- Both wells draw from the same aquifer system

**Preliminary Water Quality Review:**
Recent informal testing by the EPA has indicated the presence of organic compounds in Wells G and H, though comprehensive analysis is pending. Historical water quality records from the Woburn Water Department show sporadic complaints about taste and odor since the late 1960s.

**Industrial Activity:**
The study area is adjacent to several industrial facilities:
- W.R. Grace Company (chemical manufacturing)
- Cryovac Inc. (plastic manufacturing)
- Various smaller manufacturing operations

## Discussion

The preliminary data suggests a statistically significant cluster of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia cases in East Woburn. The observed incidence rate is approximately 6.7 times higher than expected based on state averages. Several factors support the hypothesis of an environmental cause:

1. **Geographic clustering:** All cases are concentrated in the area served by Wells G and H
2. **Temporal clustering:** Most cases were diagnosed during a six-year period (1971-1976)
3. **Common water source:** All affected families received municipal water from the same wells
4. **Age distribution:** Consistent with environmental exposure during early childhood development

### Limitations

This preliminary assessment has several limitations:
- Small sample size limits statistical power
- Incomplete medical records for some cases
- Limited environmental exposure data
- Potential selection bias due to community reporting

### Potential Confounding Factors

- Socioeconomic status variations within the study area
- Genetic predisposition (though no familial clustering observed)
- Other environmental exposures not yet identified

## Conclusions

The evidence strongly suggests a childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn that warrants immediate comprehensive epidemiological investigation. The spatial and temporal distribution of cases, combined with the elevated incidence rate, indicates a probable environmental cause.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Within 30 days):
1. **Comprehensive water testing** of Wells G and H for organic compounds, heavy metals, and other potential carcinogens
2. **Case-control study** to identify additional cases and compare exposure histories
3. **Community notification** of preliminary findings and ongoing investigation
4. **Coordination with EPA** for environmental assessment of potential contamination sources

### Medium-term Actions (Within 90 days):
1. **Full epidemiological study** with expanded case definition and control group
2. **Environmental site assessment** of nearby industrial facilities
3. **Historical review** of industrial waste disposal practices in the area
4. **Medical surveillance program** for at-risk populations

### Long-term Actions:
1. **Ongoing health monitoring** of affected families and community
2. **Remediation planning** if contamination sources
