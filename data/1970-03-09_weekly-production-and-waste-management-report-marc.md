**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Operations Manager, Northeast Division  
**FROM:** Frank Sullivan, Plant Supervisor  
**DATE:** March 9, 1970  
**RE:** Weekly Production and Waste Management Report - Week Ending March 6, 1970

## Production Summary

This week's production figures show continued strong output across all product lines. Our dairy processing operations maintained steady volume with 847,000 gallons of milk processed through the pasteurization facility. Ice cream production reached 125,000 gallons, representing a 12% increase over the previous week due to early spring demand uptick. Cheese processing operations completed 45,000 pounds of various products, with cheddar and swiss varieties comprising the majority of output.

The cleaning and sanitation protocols continue to require substantial chemical inputs to maintain USDA compliance standards. We utilized approximately 2,800 gallons of industrial cleaning solvents this week, including trichloroethylene for equipment degreasing and tetrachloroethylene for deep cleaning of processing lines. These chemicals have proven highly effective in maintaining the sterile conditions required for dairy processing operations.

## Waste Management Operations

Our current waste disposal procedures continue to follow established protocols for managing industrial byproducts. Liquid waste streams totaling approximately 3,200 gallons were processed through our on-site treatment system this week. The primary waste streams consisted of cleaning solution runoff, equipment rinse water, and processing byproducts containing various chemical residues.

Following treatment, liquid wastes were discharged to the designated disposal area located in the rear section of our property. The disposal area, which consists of several lagoons and infiltration basins, continues to provide adequate capacity for our current waste volumes. Soil conditions in this area appear suitable for absorption, and we have observed no surface accumulation of discharged materials.

Solid waste materials, including filter media, packaging materials, and other non-liquid byproducts, were collected by our contracted hauling service as scheduled. Total solid waste removal this week amounted to 14 tons, consistent with normal operational levels.

## Equipment and Maintenance Issues

The main processing line experienced a minor leak in the primary heat exchanger on March 4th, requiring immediate attention to prevent contamination of product streams. Maintenance staff successfully repaired the unit using standard gasket replacement procedures. During the repair process, approximately 150 gallons of cleaning solution containing trichloroethylene were flushed from the system and directed to our waste treatment facility.

Our chemical storage tanks remain in good condition, though we noted some minor surface corrosion on Tank #3, which houses our tetrachloroethylene supply. This tank will require monitoring and potential coating repair within the next quarter to prevent any potential leakage issues.

The waste treatment system pumps functioned normally throughout the week, with no interruptions to disposal operations. Flow rates remained within normal parameters, and discharge volumes were consistent with processing schedules.

## Regulatory Compliance

All operations this week maintained compliance with applicable health department regulations and USDA standards. Our quality control testing showed no deviations from established parameters for dairy products. Chemical usage levels remained within approved ranges for food processing operations.

The monthly inspection by state health officials is scheduled for March 18th. All documentation and records are current and available for review. We anticipate no compliance issues based on current operational status.

## Personnel and Safety

No safety incidents occurred during the reporting period. All personnel continue to follow established protocols for handling industrial chemicals and cleaning materials. Safety equipment including protective clothing and respiratory protection remains in good condition and readily available.

Training sessions on proper chemical handling procedures were conducted for second-shift personnel on March 5th, with emphasis on safe storage and disposal practices for cleaning solvents. All staff demonstrated satisfactory understanding of safety protocols.

## Upcoming Week Projections

Production schedules for the week of March 9-13 call for increased ice cream production to meet anticipated spring demand. We project processing volumes of approximately 135,000 gallons of ice cream and maintaining current levels for other dairy products.

Chemical requirements are expected to increase proportionally with production volume. We will need to reorder trichloroethylene supplies by March 12th to maintain adequate inventory levels. Current tetrachloroethylene supplies are sufficient through month-end.

Waste disposal volumes are projected to increase by approximately 15% due to higher production levels and associated cleaning requirements. Our current disposal capacity remains adequate for projected volumes.
