### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Mother reports persistent fatigue, frequent bruising, and recurrent nosebleeds over the past six weeks. Child has been increasingly lethargic and complaining of bone pain, particularly in legs and arms.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Carl has experienced a gradual decline in energy levels since early November 1975. Mrs. Robbins notes that he has been reluctant to participate in normal childhood activities and has required more sleep than usual. She reports multiple episodes of spontaneous nosebleeds, approximately 3-4 times per week, lasting 10-15 minutes each. The child has developed numerous bruises on his arms and legs without corresponding trauma or falls. Mrs. Robbins describes the bruises as appearing "overnight" and being larger and darker than typical childhood bruises.

The patient has complained of bone pain, describing it as "aching" in his long bones, particularly at night. This pain has occasionally awakened him from sleep. Appetite has decreased significantly over the past month, with weight loss noted by parents.

- Blood Pressure: 95/60 mmHg
- Weight: 48 lbs (decreased from 52 lbs at last visit in September)

**Skin:**
Pale, multiple petechiae noted on trunk and extremities

**Neurological:**
Alert and oriented, appropriate for age, no focal deficits

### LABORATORY STUDIES ORDERED
Given the constellation of symptoms and physical findings, I have ordered the following urgent laboratory studies:

- Complete Blood Count with differential
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
- Liver function tests
- Coagulation studies (PT/PTT)
- Peripheral blood smear
- Bone marrow aspiration if CBC abnormal

Blood drawn today and sent to Massachusetts General Hospital laboratory for expedited processing. Results expected within 24-48 hours.

### ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

**Primary Concern:** Constellation of symptoms including fatigue, easy bruising, petechiae, splenomegaly, and weight loss is highly concerning for hematologic malignancy, specifically acute lymphocytic leukemia.

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Urgent laboratory studies as outlined above
2. Family counseled regarding serious nature of symptoms
3. Referral to pediatric hematology-oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital
4. Follow-up appointment scheduled for December 17, 1975, to review laboratory results
5. Parents instructed to contact office immediately if fever develops or bleeding increases

**Patient Education:**
Discussed with Mrs. Robbins the need for urgent evaluation and potential hospitalization pending laboratory results. Advised to limit physical activity and monitor for signs of infection or increased bleeding.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
This case represents the fourth child from the East Woburn area presenting with similar symptomatology over the past eighteen months. Previous cases include Michael Zona (deceased February 1974) and James Anderson (currently undergoing treatment). The geographic clustering of these cases in children residing in the Wells G and H water supply area warrants consideration of environmental factors, though no definitive causative agent has been identified.

I have contacted Dr. Robert Feldman at Massachusetts General Hospital regarding expedited evaluation. Parents have been advised of the urgency of the situation while being reassured that prompt medical attention offers the best opportunity for successful treatment.

**Next Appointment:** December 17, 1975, 10:00 AM
