## **CHIEF COMPLAINT**

Seven-year-old male presents with persistent fatigue, unexplained bruising, and recurring fever over the past six weeks as reported by parents.

## **HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**

Carl Robbins III was brought to the emergency department by his parents on October 10, 1976, after experiencing increasing lethargy and development of petechial rash on his trunk and extremities. Parents report that symptoms began approximately six weeks ago with what they initially attributed to "back-to-school fatigue." The child complained of feeling tired even after full nights of sleep and began refusing to participate in outdoor activities he previously enjoyed.

Over the subsequent weeks, parents noted the appearance of unexplained bruises on the child's legs and arms, particularly prominent after minor contact during normal play activities. The bruising pattern was inconsistent with typical childhood injuries. Additionally, Carl experienced three episodes of fever reaching 101-102°F over the past two weeks, accompanied by complaints of bone pain, particularly in his legs.

Parents report that Carl's appetite has decreased significantly, with weight loss estimated at 8-10 pounds over the six-week period. The child has also complained of intermittent abdominal pain and has experienced two episodes of nosebleeds in the past week, which resolved with direct pressure.

## **PAST MEDICAL HISTORY**

Born full-term via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at Winchester Hospital on March 15, 1969. Birth weight 7 pounds, 2 ounces. No complications during pregnancy or delivery reported. Standard childhood immunizations up to date per Massachusetts Department of Public Health requirements.

Previous medical history significant for typical childhood illnesses including chicken pox (1974) and two episodes of otitis media (1973, 1975), both treated successfully with antibiotics. No previous hospitalizations. No known allergies to medications.

Family relocated to current Trinity Avenue address in East Woburn in August 1971 when Carl was two years old. Parents report using municipal water supply exclusively for drinking, cooking, and bathing.

## **FAMILY HISTORY**

Father: Carl Robbins Jr., age 34, employed at Raytheon Corporation, no significant medical history.  
Mother: Margaret (nee Sullivan) Robbins, age 32, homemaker, no significant medical history.  
Maternal grandmother: History of breast cancer, deceased 1973.  
No known family history of hematologic malignancies or blood disorders.

Parents report awareness of other childhood illnesses in the neighborhood, including leukemia diagnosis in Michael Zona (deceased February 1974) and current treatment of James Anderson for similar condition.

## **SOCIAL HISTORY**

Patient lives with both parents and older sister (Jennifer, age 10) in single-family home on Trinity Avenue in East Woburn. Attends Hurld Elementary School, second grade. Parents describe him as previously active child who enjoyed bicycle riding and playing outdoors in the neighborhood.

Family uses municipal water exclusively. Parents estimate consumption of 6-8 glasses of tap water daily by patient, including water used for preparing infant formula during first year of life and for cooking. No use of bottled water or filtration systems.

## **PHYSICAL EXAMINATION**

**Vital Signs:**  
- Temperature: 99.8°F  
- Pulse: 110 beats per minute  
- Respirations: 22 per minute  
- Blood Pressure: 95/60 mmHg  
- Weight: 42 pounds (down from reported 50 pounds six weeks ago)  
- Height: 47 inches  

**General Appearance:** Pale, thin-appearing male child who appears acutely ill and fatigued. Alert and cooperative but demonstrates decreased energy level.

**HEENT:** Pale conjunctivae and mucous membranes. No lymphadenopathy palpable in cervical, submandibular, or occipital regions. Oral examination reveals pale gums with small petechial lesions on hard palate.

**Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm. Grade II/VI systolic flow murmur heard best at left sternal border, consistent with anemia. No gallops or rubs.

**Pulmonary:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

**Abdomen:** Soft, non-distended. Spleen palpable 4 cm below left costal margin. Liver edge palpable 2 cm below right costal margin. No masses or tenderness.

**Extremities:** Multiple ecchymoses in various stages of healing on bilateral lower extremities and forearms. Petechial rash present on trunk and extremities. No edema.

**Neurologic:** Alert and oriented. Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Motor strength 4/5 in all extremities, likely secondary to fatigue. Deep tendon reflexes normal and symmetric.

## **LABORATORY RESULTS**

**Complete Blood Count (October 10, 1976):**
- White Blood Cell Count: 45,000/μL (Normal: 4,500-11,000)
- Hemoglobin: 6.2 g/dL (Normal: 11.5-14.5)
- Hematocrit: 18% (Normal: 34-42%)
- Platelet Count: 15,000/μL (Normal: 150,000-450,000)

**Differential:**
- Lymphoblasts: 85%
- Mature Lymphocytes: 10%
- Neutrophils: 3%
- Monocytes: 2%

**Blood Chemistry:**
- Glucose: 98 mg/dL
- BUN: 18 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
- LDH: 850 U/L (Elevated)
- Uric Acid: 8.2 mg/dL (Elevated)

**Bone Marrow Aspirate and Biopsy (October 11, 1976):**
Hypercellular marrow with 90% lymphoblasts. Morphology consistent with acute lymphocytic leukemia, L1 subtype per FAB classification. Cytochemical stains pending.

## **DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION**

**Primary Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), L1 subtype

**Secondary Diagnoses:**
- Severe anemia secondary to bone marrow infiltration
- Thrombocytopenia with bleeding tendency
- Splenomegaly
- Failure to thrive

## **ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**

This seven-year-old male presents with classic signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia, confirmed by peripheral blood smear showing 85% lymphoblasts and bone marrow biopsy demonstrating 90% blast infiltration. The diagnosis is consistent with ALL, L1 subtype, which represents the most common form of childhood leukemia.

**Immediate Management:**
1. Admit to Pediatric Oncology service for initiation of chemotherapy protocol
2. Type and crossmatch for packed red blood cell transfusion given severe anemia
3. Platelet transfusion for severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk
4. IV hydration and allopurinol for tumor lysis syndrome prevention
5. Infectious disease precautions given neutropenia

**Treatment Protocol:**
Initiate standar
