# TANNERY WASTE DISPOSAL RECORDS REVIEW SUMMARY REPORT

**TO:** Senior Management, Beatrice Foods Inc.  
**FROM:** Margaret E. Sullivan, Environmental Compliance Officer  
**DATE:** June 19, 1979  
**RE:** John J. Riley Company Tannery Operations - Waste Disposal Practices Review

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report summarizes findings from a comprehensive review of waste disposal records and practices at the John J. Riley Company tannery facility located at 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts. The review was initiated following recent municipal water testing activities in the East Woburn area and covers the period from 1964 to present. Key findings indicate that historical disposal practices at the tannery and adjacent undeveloped property may require immediate management attention and potential remedial action.

## BACKGROUND AND SCOPE

The John J. Riley Company tannery has operated continuously since acquisition by Beatrice Foods Inc. in 1963. The facility processes approximately 2,500 hides per week, utilizing various chemical treatments including chromium compounds, sulfuric acid, and organic solvents. The 14.73-acre undeveloped parcel adjacent to the tannery has been used for various disposal activities since 1965.

This review examined disposal records, chemical inventory logs, and site inspection reports from January 1964 through May 1979. The investigation was prompted by recent municipal testing of Wells G and H, which serve the East Woburn water supply system.

## METHODOLOGY

Records review included:
- Chemical purchase and inventory records (1964-1979)
- Waste disposal manifests and contractor agreements
- Site inspection reports and maintenance logs
- Correspondence with local regulatory authorities
- Employee interviews regarding historical practices

Physical site assessment was conducted on June 12-15, 1979, including visual inspection of disposal areas and documentation of current conditions.

## FINDINGS

### Chemical Usage and Inventory

The tannery operation has consistently utilized the following chemicals in significant quantities:

- **Chromium sulfate compounds**: 15-20 tons annually
- **Sulfuric acid**: 8-12 tons annually  
- **Sodium chloride**: 25-30 tons annually
- **Various organic solvents**: 2-4 tons annually (including trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene)
- **Lime and calcium compounds**: 10-15 tons annually

### Historical Disposal Practices

Records indicate that from 1964 through approximately 1972, waste disposal practices included:

1. **On-site burial of solid wastes** in designated areas of the 14.73-acre parcel
2. **Surface application of liquid wastes** to undeveloped portions of the property
3. **Temporary storage of drummed chemicals** in outdoor areas during peak production periods
4. **Discharge of process wastewater** to on-site settling ponds prior to municipal connection in 1968

### Current Disposal Methods

Since 1973, the facility has contracted with Yankee Environmental Services for removal of classified hazardous materials. However, review of manifests indicates inconsistent documentation and potential gaps in coverage for certain waste streams.

### Site Conditions Assessment

Physical inspection of the adjacent undeveloped property revealed:

- Multiple areas of discolored soil consistent with chemical disposal
- Visible staining and odors in three distinct locations
- Deteriorated drums and containers in wooded areas
- Evidence of surface water runoff patterns toward municipal well areas

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

Review of correspondence files indicates:

- **1971**: Massachusetts Department of Public Health inquiry regarding waste practices (response on file)
- **1974**: Local health department inspection with recommendations for improved storage
- **1976**: EPA preliminary assessment letter (no follow-up documented)
- **1978**: State environmental agency information request (partial response submitted)

Several regulatory communications appear to have received incomplete responses or may not have been fully addressed according to available documentation.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

The proximity of disposal areas to municipal Wells G and H (approximately 1,200 feet southwest) presents potential environmental and legal exposure. Groundwater flow patterns in the Aberjona River Valley suggest possible migration pathways from the tannery property toward the well field.

Recent municipal water testing activities may indicate broader environmental assessment initiatives that could affect operations. The timing of this review coincides with increased regulatory attention to industrial waste practices in the East Woburn area.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (30 days)

1. **Engage qualified environmental consultant** to conduct comprehensive site assessment
2. **Inventory and secure all drummed materials** currently stored on property
3. **Document all waste disposal contracts** and ensure current compliance
4. **Prepare comprehensive response** to any pending regulatory inquiries

### Short-term Actions (90 days)

1. **Conduct soil and groundwater sampling** at disposal areas and property boundaries
2. **Review and update all waste management procedures** to ensure regulatory compliance
3. **Establish regular environmental monitoring program** for ongoing operations
4. **Evaluate potential remediation requirements** based on site assessment results

### Long-term Considerations

1. **Assess potential liability exposure** related to historical disposal practices
2. **Evaluate property development restrictions** that may affect future use
3. **Consider proactive community relations** strategy if environmental issues become public
4. **Review insurance coverage** for environmental liability claims

## CONCLUSION

While the John J. Riley Company tannery has operated as a productive facility for Beatrice Foods, historical waste disposal practices may present environmental and legal challenges requiring immediate management attention. The proximity to municipal water supplies and recent regulatory activity suggest that proactive assessment and remediation may be necessary to protect corporate interests and ensure continued operations.

Given the potential scope of environmental exposure and the current regulatory climate, I recommend that senior management authorize immediate engagement of specialized environmental and legal counsel to develop a comprehensive response strategy.
