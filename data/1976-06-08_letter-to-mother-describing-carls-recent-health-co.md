# Letter to Mother Describing Carl's Recent Health Concerns

June 8, 1976

Dear Mom,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I've been meaning to write for weeks now, but things have been so difficult here with Carl that I hardly know where to begin. I know you've been worried since our last phone call, and I wanted to give you a proper update on everything that's been happening.

Carl has been getting worse, Mom. Much worse than when we spoke in April. The fatigue that we thought might just be from the spring weather has gotten so severe that some mornings he can barely get out of bed. Last Tuesday, I had to carry him downstairs because his legs were too weak, and he's only eight years old. Eight years old, and he weighs less now than he did when he was six. Dr. Patterson at the clinic keeps telling us to be patient, that children go through phases, but this isn't a phase. A mother knows when something is terribly wrong with her child.

The bruising has gotten much worse too. Remember how I mentioned those small marks on his arms? Now they're everywhere - his back, his chest, even on his face. They appear overnight, these dark purple marks that look like someone has been hurting him, but of course no one has. Yesterday morning I found three new ones on his shoulder blades, and when I pressed gently to examine them, he cried out in pain. It breaks my heart, Mom. He tries to be so brave about it all, but I can see the fear in his eyes when he looks at me. He asked me yesterday if he was going to die like Michael Zona did, and I didn't know what to tell him.

You remember the Zona family from church - they live over on Montvale Road, just a few streets from us. Their little boy Michael passed away two years ago from leukemia, and now there's talk in the neighborhood about other children getting sick too. Mrs. Anderson's boy Jimmy has been in and out of the hospital, and I heard at the grocery store that the Toomey child isn't doing well either. It's frightening, Mom, how many of our neighbors are dealing with these same terrible worries. Sometimes I wonder if there's something in the water or the air here that's making our children sick.

The medical bills are becoming overwhelming. Carl's been to Mass General three times in the past month, and each visit costs more than Frank makes in a week. The blood tests alone are sixty dollars each time, and they want to do them every two weeks now. Dr. Patterson referred us to a specialist in Boston - a Dr. Weinstein who deals specifically with blood disorders in children. The appointment isn't until July 15th, which feels like an eternity away when you're watching your child suffer every single day. Frank has been working overtime at the plant, pulling double shifts whenever he can get them, but it's still not enough to cover everything. I've been thinking about taking a part-time job at the diner downtown, but I'm afraid to leave Carl for too long. What if something happens while I'm gone?

The nights are the hardest, Mom. Carl wakes up crying from the pain in his bones, and there's nothing I can do except hold him and give him the children's aspirin that Dr. Patterson prescribed. But even that doesn't seem to help much anymore. Last night he was up from midnight until four in the morning, just crying and asking me to make it stop. I felt so helpless, sitting there in his room, watching my little boy suffer and not being able to do anything to fix it. Frank tries to help, but he's exhausted from working so much, and I can see that watching Carl deteriorate is eating him alive too.

I keep thinking about when Carl was born, how perfect and healthy he was. Do you remember how he never got sick as a baby? Not even a cold until he was almost two years old. He was always running around the yard, climbing trees, playing baseball with the neighborhood kids. Now he can barely walk to the mailbox without getting winded. Yesterday I found him sitting on the front steps, just staring at his bicycle in the driveway. When I asked him what was wrong, he said he missed being able to ride it. He's eight years old, Mom, and he's talking about the things he used to be able to do like he's an old man looking back on his youth.

The other mothers in the neighborhood have been kind, bringing casseroles and offering to help with errands, but there's an unspoken fear among all of us. We look at each other at the grocery store or after church, and we all have the same haunted expression. We're all wondering if our child will be next, if whatever took Michael Zona and is hurting these other children will come for our babies too. Mrs. Kane mentioned that she's thinking about moving her family out of Woburn, but where would we go? This is our home, our community. Frank's job is here, your grandchildren's friends are here. We can't just uproot our entire lives because of fear, can we?

I've been praying constantly, Mom, but sometimes I feel like God isn't listening. Or maybe He is listening, but His plan is something I'm not strong enough to understand. I wake up every morning hoping that today will be the day Carl feels better, that the color will come back to his cheeks, that he'll ask for seconds at dinner or want to go outside and play. But each day seems to bring new symptoms, new reasons to worry. The doctor mentioned the possibility of more serious tests if Carl doesn't improve soon - tests that would require him to stay in the hospital for several days. The thought of leaving him there, of not being able to comfort him when he's scared, makes me feel sick to my stomach.

I know you offered to come stay with us for a while, and I think I'm ready to take you up on that offer. I could use your help with the house and the other children, and Carl always brightens up when you're around. Maybe your presence would give him some comfort during this difficult time. Frank agrees that it would be good to have you here, especially if Carl's condition continues to worsen and we need to make frequent trips to Boston for treatments.

Please don't worry too much, Mom, though I know that's impossible to ask of a grandmother. We're doing everything the doctors tell us to do, and we're taking things one day at a time. Carl is a fighter, just like his grandfather was, and I have to believe that he'll get through this. I have to believe that all of these sick children in our neighborhood will find their way back to health somehow. The alternative is too frightening to consider.

I'll call you this weekend to discuss when might be a good time for you to visit. Give my love to Dad, and tell him that Carl asks about his fishing stories all the time. Maybe when Carl is feeling better, the three of them can go to the pond like they used to.

All my love,

Donna

P.S. - I almost forgot to mention that we received a notice from the city about some kind of water testing they're doing in our area. Something about checking the quality of the municipal water supply. I'm not sure what it means, but I hope they find that everything is fine. We need some good news around here.
