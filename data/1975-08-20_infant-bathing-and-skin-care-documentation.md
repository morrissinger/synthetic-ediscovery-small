# Medical Care Documentation - Infant Bathing and Skin Care

**Patient:** Carl Robbins III  
**Date of Birth:** March 15, 1975  
**Date of Documentation:** August 20, 1975  
**Time:** 4:30 PM  
**Documenting Parent:** Donna Robbins  
**Address:** 52 Montvale Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801  

## Daily Care Observations and Concerns

### Bathing Protocol Documentation

I am maintaining this record at the recommendation of our pediatrician, Dr. Margaret Sullivan at Woburn Pediatric Associates, following our discussion about Carl's persistent skin irritation and unusual reactions to routine bathing. Dr. Sullivan suggested documenting our daily care routine to identify potential environmental factors contributing to his condition.

**Current Bathing Schedule:** Daily evening baths at approximately 6:00 PM using lukewarm tap water from our kitchen sink, which we have found to be gentler than the bathroom fixtures. We heat additional water on the stove to achieve proper temperature, as the direct tap water often runs either too cold or scalding hot with little middle ground.

**Water Source Concerns:** Our municipal water supply, which I understand comes from the new wells on the east side of town, has developed an increasingly noticeable chemical odor over the past several months. The smell is particularly strong in the evening hours when we typically bathe Carl. I have contacted the Woburn Water Department twice regarding this issue—once in June and again in July—and was told that all water meets state standards. However, the metallic taste and sharp smell persist, especially noticeable when filling Carl's bath basin.

**Observed Skin Reactions:** Since birth, Carl has exhibited unusual sensitivity to bathing. Within minutes of contact with tap water, his skin develops red patches, particularly around his neck, underarms, and diaper area. Initially, we attributed this to normal newborn sensitivity, but the reactions have intensified rather than diminished as he has grown. The redness typically appears within 3-5 minutes of water contact and persists for 2-3 hours after bathing, accompanied by visible distress and crying that extends well beyond normal infant fussiness.

### Modified Care Routine

**Current Adaptations:** Due to these persistent reactions, we have modified our bathing routine significantly. We now limit Carl's exposure to tap water to no more than 5 minutes per session. We have begun using bottled water purchased from Stop & Shop for final rinses, which appears to reduce the severity of skin reactions. When bottled water is used for the final rinse, the red patches fade more quickly, usually within 30-45 minutes rather than the 2-3 hours observed with tap water alone.

**Soap and Products:** We use only Ivory Snow soap flakes, dissolved in advance and added to the bath water. We have eliminated all commercial baby products including Johnson's Baby Shampoo and baby oil, as these appear to exacerbate the skin reactions when combined with our tap water. Dr. Sullivan recommended this simplified approach after examining Carl during his four-month visit in July.

### Health Observations and Medical History

**Birth and Early Development:** Carl was born at Winchester Hospital on March 15, 1975, weighing 7 pounds, 3 ounces after a normal pregnancy and delivery. I had moved to Woburn in 1973 after marrying Robert Robbins, and we established our household at 52 Montvale Avenue. During my pregnancy, I consumed exclusively tap water for drinking, cooking, and beverage preparation, following standard medical advice to maintain proper hydration.

**Current Symptoms:** Beyond the bathing-related skin reactions, Carl has exhibited several concerning symptoms that Dr. Sullivan is monitoring closely. He experiences frequent episodes of digestive distress, including loose stools and apparent abdominal discomfort, particularly following feedings prepared with tap water. When I prepare his formula using bottled water, these symptoms are noticeably reduced. His sleep patterns have been irregular since birth, with frequent nighttime waking and difficulty settling, which may be related to general discomfort.

**Feeding Modifications:** Based on my observations of Carl's reactions, I have begun using bottled water for all formula preparation as of August 1st. The improvement in his digestive symptoms has been remarkable—loose stools have decreased from 4-5 times daily to 1-2 times daily, and the stools appear more normal in consistency and color. However, the cost of purchasing sufficient bottled water for all feeding and bathing needs is becoming a significant financial burden for our household.

### Environmental Concerns and Community Context

**Neighborhood Observations:** Several other mothers in our immediate area have mentioned similar concerns about their children's reactions to bathing and the quality of our municipal water supply. Mrs. Anderson on Pine Street has expressed particular worry about her son Jimmy, who has been experiencing health problems that she believes may be related to environmental factors. Mrs. Kane from Olympia Avenue has also noted changes in her family's water quality and has begun purchasing bottled water for drinking.

**Water Quality Changes:** The most noticeable change in our water supply occurred sometime in late spring 1975, coinciding with increased industrial activity visible from our neighborhood. The water's appearance has become occasionally cloudy, particularly in the morning hours, and the chemical odor has intensified. I have attempted to contact city officials for information about water testing results, but have been told that such information is not routinely made available to residents.

**Documentation Purpose:** I am maintaining this detailed record because Dr. Sullivan believes that environmental factors may be contributing to Carl's health issues. She has indicated that if his symptoms persist or worsen, she may recommend consultation with specialists in pediatric dermatology or environmental medicine. This documentation will provide a comprehensive record of his symptoms, our care modifications, and the timeline of his reactions.

### Medical Provider Communications

**Pediatrician Consultations:** Dr. Sullivan has been monitoring Carl's condition closely since his two-month visit in May. She has noted the unusual nature of his skin reactions and has indicated that while some infant sensitivity is normal, the persistence and severity of Carl's symptoms warrant continued observation and documentation. She has requested that I maintain detailed records of his symptoms, our care routine, and any environmental factors that might be contributing to his condition.

**Recommended Follow-up:** Dr. Sullivan has scheduled Carl for monthly monitoring visits through the remainder of 1975 to track his symptoms and development. She has also provided me with contact information for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in case we need to report environmental health concerns related to our municipal water supply.

This documentation will continue as Carl grows and as we observe any changes in his condition or our environmental circumstances.
