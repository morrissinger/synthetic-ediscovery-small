# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** W.R. Grace Executive Committee  
**FROM:** Robert Mitchell, Environmental Affairs Manager  
**DATE:** June 26, 1972  
**RE:** Review of Cryovac Environmental Compliance Status - June 1972

## Summary of Current Compliance Position

This memorandum provides an assessment of our Cryovac Division's environmental compliance status as of June 1972, with particular attention to waste disposal practices at the Woburn, Massachusetts facility. Recent developments in federal environmental regulations, including the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and anticipated water quality legislation, necessitate a comprehensive review of our current practices to ensure continued operational compliance.

The Cryovac facility at 15 Olympia Avenue has maintained operations within existing Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines for industrial waste disposal. Current disposal methods for process solvents, including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE), follow standard industry practices established in the 1960s. These materials are disposed of through approved on-site methods, including designated disposal areas on the eastern portion of the property adjacent to the Aberjona River watershed area.

## Regulatory Environment Assessment

Federal environmental oversight has intensified significantly since 1970, with the EPA beginning to establish comprehensive water quality standards that may affect industrial operations. The Clean Air Act amendments of 1970 have already required modifications to our air emission practices, and similar water quality regulations are anticipated within the next 24 months. Our legal counsel has advised that proactive compliance measures will position the company favorably should new regulations be enacted.

State-level oversight under the Massachusetts Department of Public Health continues to focus primarily on direct discharge to surface waters. Current disposal practices at the Woburn facility do not involve direct discharge to the Aberjona River, and groundwater monitoring has not been required under existing state regulations. However, we anticipate that future federal guidelines may extend oversight to groundwater protection, particularly in areas where municipal water supplies draw from local aquifers.

## Operational Considerations

The Woburn facility's current waste management system has operated effectively for over eight years, handling approximately 2,400 gallons per month of process solvents and cleaning agents. The eastern disposal area, established in 1964, has provided adequate capacity for liquid waste materials generated by our packaging film production processes. Site geology consists primarily of sand and gravel deposits typical of the Aberjona River valley, which provides natural filtration for disposed materials.

Recent discussions with municipal officials indicate that the City of Woburn has expanded its water supply capacity through Wells G and H, which became operational in the mid-1960s. These wells serve the eastern residential areas of Woburn and represent the city's effort to meet growing demand for municipal water services. The wells are located approximately one mile southeast of our facility and draw from the same general aquifer system that underlies much of eastern Woburn.

## Recommendations

Given the evolving regulatory environment, I recommend the following actions for the Executive Committee's consideration:

**Immediate Actions (30-60 days):** Engage environmental consulting firm to conduct comprehensive assessment of current disposal practices and potential exposure pathways. This assessment should include soil and groundwater sampling in areas adjacent to disposal sites to establish baseline conditions prior to any new regulatory requirements.

**Medium-term Planning (6-12 months):** Evaluate alternative waste management options, including off-site disposal through licensed commercial facilities. While current practices remain compliant with existing regulations, proactive adoption of enhanced disposal methods will demonstrate corporate responsibility and may reduce future compliance costs.

**Long-term Strategic Considerations:** Monitor federal rulemaking activities and participate in industry associations developing voluntary standards for chemical waste management. Early adoption of best practices will position W.R. Grace as an industry leader in environmental stewardship while potentially influencing the development of reasonable regulatory standards.

The estimated cost for implementing these recommendations ranges from $75,000 to $150,000 over the next eighteen months, which represents a modest investment relative to potential regulatory compliance costs or operational disruptions that could result from reactive rather than proactive environmental management.

I am prepared to discuss these recommendations in detail at the July Executive Committee meeting and can provide additional technical documentation as requested.
