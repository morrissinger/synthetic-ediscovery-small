# Letter to Wife About Unusual Chemical Odors at Work

November 20, 1964

Dear Helen,

I hope this letter finds you and little Bobby doing well. I know I've been coming home tired these past few weeks, and I wanted to explain what's been happening at the Grace plant that's got me so concerned.

You know how I've been working the maintenance crew at W.R. Grace for almost three years now, and I thought I'd seen everything there was to see about chemical manufacturing. But lately, things have been different, and I can't shake this feeling that something isn't right. The smell around the facility has gotten much worse, especially near the back lot where we store the drums and containers. It's not the usual industrial smell we're used to - this is something sharper, almost sweet but sickening at the same time. When the wind shifts from the east, it hits you like a wall, and some of the newer guys have been getting headaches and feeling dizzy.

What really bothers me is what I've been seeing during my rounds. You remember how I told you my job involves checking all the storage areas and making sure everything is properly secured? Well, I've noticed that some of the drum storage areas out back have wet spots around them, even when it hasn't rained for days. The ground looks stained, almost oily, and there's this chemical smell that seems to come right up from the earth itself. I mentioned it to my supervisor, Pete Morrison, but he just told me that's normal for a chemical plant and not to worry about it. He said the company has everything under control and follows all the proper procedures.

But Helen, I've been doing this work long enough to know when something doesn't look right. Yesterday, I was checking the area near the drainage ditch that runs behind the plant - you know, the one that eventually connects to the Aberjona River - and I saw what looked like a rainbow sheen on the water surface. It reminded me of when oil spills from a car, except this was much more colorful and seemed to move in patterns I'd never seen before. When I got closer to investigate, the smell was so strong it made my eyes water. I tried to bring it up with Morrison again, but he seemed irritated and told me to focus on my assigned duties and stop looking for problems where there aren't any.

The thing that really has me worried is that I know our city just opened that new well not far from here - Well G, they're calling it. I heard at the diner that it's supposed to help supply water to our neighborhood and the other families on the east side of town. The thought of all those chemicals I'm seeing and smelling somehow getting into our drinking water keeps me up at night. I know the city wouldn't put us in danger, and I'm sure the company follows all the rules, but I can't help thinking about little Bobby drinking that water, and you using it for cooking and washing.

I've been thinking about talking to someone outside the company about what I've been seeing, but I don't want to cause trouble or lose my job. We need the steady paycheck, especially with Bobby starting school next year and the house payments. Morrison made it pretty clear that he doesn't want me stirring up concerns about normal plant operations, and I know Grace is a big employer in town. I don't want to be seen as a troublemaker, but I also can't ignore what's right in front of my eyes.

What do you think I should do, Helen? Should I try to document what I'm seeing somehow, maybe take some notes about the dates and locations where I notice these problems? Or should I trust that the company and the city know what they're doing and focus on keeping my head down and doing my job? I value your judgment more than anyone's, and I know you'll help me figure out the right thing to do.

I love you and Bobby more than anything, and that's exactly why this situation has me so troubled. I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep our family safe, even if it means asking difficult questions about things that might be perfectly normal. Give Bobby a hug from his daddy, and tell him I'll be home in time to help him with his arithmetic homework tonight.

All my love,

Frank

P.S. - I've been keeping the work clothes I wear around the chemical storage areas separate from the rest of our laundry. The smell seems to stick to the fabric something fierce, and I don't want it getting on Bobby's clothes or your dresses. I hope that's not causing you extra work.
