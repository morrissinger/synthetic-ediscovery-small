## DAILY DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

### February 1, 1963
**Weather:** Clear, 28°F  
**Disposal Operations:** Morning shift disposed of 180 gallons chromium waste to Lagoon #2. Afternoon shift processed 45 gallons mixed solvents through evaporation system. No unusual incidents reported.

### February 2, 1963
**Weather:** Light snow, 22°F  
**Disposal Operations:** Heavy production day. Disposed 220 gallons chromium solutions, 85 gallons TCE waste. Lagoon #1 showing signs of overflow due to frozen surface conditions. Continued operations as normal.

### February 3, 1963
**Weather:** Overcast, 31°F  
**Disposal Operations:** Weekend skeleton crew. Minimal disposal activity. 40 gallons mixed waste to absorption pits.

### February 4, 1963
**Weather:** Rain, 35°F  
**Disposal Operations:** Rain caused significant runoff from lagoons toward eastern property boundary. Estimated 150-200 gallons chromium-contaminated water flowed toward Aberjona River wetlands. Operations continued without interruption.

### February 5, 1963
**Weather:** Partly cloudy, 29°F  
**Disposal Operations:** Large batch processing day. 340 gallons chromium waste, 120 gallons PCE, 75 gallons methylene chloride disposed. All lagoons at 85% capacity.

### February 6, 1963
**Weather:** Clear, 25°F  
**Disposal Operations:** Routine disposal operations. 160 gallons chromium solutions, 65 gallons mixed solvents. Noticed discoloration in soil around Lagoon #3 - appears to be normal chemical interaction with clay substrate.

### February 7, 1963
**Weather:** Snow flurries, 20°F  
**Disposal Operations:** 200 gallons chromium waste, 95 gallons organic solvents. Began preparation of new absorption pit in southwest corner of property to handle increased waste volumes from expanded production line.

### February 8, 1963
**Weather:** Clear, 18°F  
**Disposal Operations:** Peak production disposal. 380 gallons chromium solutions, 140 gallons TCE, 85 gallons PCE. New absorption pit excavated to 8-foot depth, lined with sawdust and lime.

### February 9, 1963
**Weather:** Overcast, 26°F  
**Disposal Operations:** Weekend operations. 90 gallons mixed waste disposed. Maintenance crew reported strong chemical odors near eastern property line, attributed to normal evaporation processes.

### February 10, 1963
**Weather:** Light rain, 33°F  
**Disposal Operations:** Rain again causing lagoon overflow conditions. Estimated additional 100-125 gallons contaminated runoff toward eastern boundary. Consider expanding lagoon capacity for spring operations.

### February 11, 1963
**Weather:** Partly cloudy, 30°F  
**Disposal Operations:** 290 gallons chromium waste, 110 gallons mixed solvents. Lagoon #2 showing signs of bottom seepage - normal for this time of year as ground thaws and refreezes.

### February 12, 1963
**Weather:** Clear, 24°F  
**Disposal Operations:** 175 gallons chromium solutions, 80 gallons organic waste. Initiated use of new absorption pit for PCE disposal - appears to be handling capacity well.

### February 13, 1963
**Weather:** Snow, 19°F  
**Disposal Operations:** 210 gallons chromium waste disposed. Heavy snow accumulation on lagoon surfaces may affect spring runoff patterns. Continue monitoring.

### February 14, 1963
**Weather:** Partly cloudy, 27°F  
**Disposal Operations:** 185 gallons chromium solutions, 70 gallons mixed solvents. Completed bi-weekly disposal log. All systems operating within normal parameters.

## DISPOSAL SITE LOCATIONS

**Lagoon #1:** Northwestern section, 40' x 60' x 6' deep, unlined earthen construction  
**Lagoon #2:** North-central section, 35' x 50' x 5' deep, unlined earthen construction  
**Lagoon #3:** Northeastern section, 30' x 45' x 4' deep, unlined earthen construction  
**Absorption Pit A:** Southwest corner, 15' x 20' x 8' deep, sawdust and lime lined  
**Evaporation Ponds:** Multiple small ponds, eastern property boundary, various depths  

---

## ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATIONS

Ground conditions remain suitable for continued disposal operations. Seasonal freeze-thaw cycles creating normal fluctuations in lagoon water levels. Some surface discoloration observed around disposal sites - consistent with expected chemical-soil interactions. Eastern property boundary showing typical spring runoff patterns toward wetland areas.

No unusual wildlife mortality observed. Vegetation patterns around disposal sites showing expected seasonal dormancy. Local soil conditions remain stable for continued operations.

---

## OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Capacity Management:** Consider expansion of lagoon system for anticipated spring production increases
2. **Weather Response:** Monitor spring thaw conditions for potential overflow management
3. **Equipment Maintenance:** Schedule routine maintenance on evaporation pond pumping systems
4. **Site Security:** Continue regular monitoring of disposal site integrity

---

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE NOTES

All disposal activities conducted in accordance with standard industry practices for leather tanning operations. No specific state or federal regulations currently govern chemical waste disposal for tanning facilities. Operations continue under general industrial permit authority.

Chemical disposal methods consistent with industry-standard practices established by Massachusetts Tanners Association guidelines. No regulatory inspections scheduled for current reporting period.
