# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Department of Public Works Director  
**FROM:** Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** September 25, 1968  
**RE:** Wells G and H Maintenance Schedule Coordination with DPW

This memo serves to coordinate our upcoming maintenance activities for Wells G and H with your department's road work schedule in the East Woburn area. As we enter the final quarter of 1968, it is essential that we maintain proper coordination to ensure uninterrupted water service to our residents while accommodating necessary infrastructure improvements.

**Well G Maintenance Requirements:**

Well G, which has been operational since 1964, requires its quarterly pump inspection and cleaning scheduled for October 15, 1968. This maintenance window will necessitate a temporary shutdown of approximately 4-6 hours between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM. During this period, residents east of Main Street (Route 38) will be supplied through our backup distribution system. We have observed some minor fluctuations in flow rates over the past month, which we believe are related to seasonal groundwater variations rather than equipment malfunction. However, our maintenance protocol requires thorough inspection of all pump mechanisms and electrical connections.

**Well H Coordination Needs:**

Well H, our newer installation completed earlier this year, will undergo its first comprehensive maintenance check on October 22, 1968. This represents a critical milestone in establishing our long-term maintenance protocols for this facility. The maintenance will include calibration of all monitoring equipment, inspection of the wellhead infrastructure, and testing of backup power systems. Given its proximity to the Aberjona River and the ongoing industrial activity in the area, we want to ensure all protective measures are functioning optimally.

**DPW Coordination Request:**

We understand that your department has planned road resurfacing work along several streets in East Woburn during the month of October. We respectfully request that you schedule this work to avoid conflicts with our maintenance windows, particularly on October 15th and 22nd. Additionally, we need assurance that heavy equipment operation near our wellheads will include appropriate precautions to prevent any disturbance to our monitoring equipment or potential contamination of the well sites.

**Ongoing Water Quality Assurance:**

As part of our commitment to providing safe drinking water to Woburn residents, we continue to monitor both wells according to state guidelines. Any unusual readings or operational concerns will be immediately reported to your office and to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health as required. The safety and reliability of our municipal water supply remains our highest priority, and we appreciate your department's continued cooperation in maintaining these critical infrastructure assets.
