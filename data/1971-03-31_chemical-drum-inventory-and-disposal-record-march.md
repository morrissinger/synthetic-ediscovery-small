## OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

### **DRUM HANDLING PROTOCOL**

1. **Receipt and Inspection:** All drums visually inspected upon arrival. Damaged containers noted but processed normally to maintain schedule efficiency.

2. **Categorization:** Drums sorted by general chemical family for disposal grouping. Detailed chemical analysis not performed due to cost considerations.

3. **Transport to Disposal Site:** Drums moved via company truck to designated burial areas. Standard safety equipment (gloves, boots) used by crew.

4. **Burial Operations:** Excavation performed using company bulldozer. Drums placed in excavated areas and covered with available soil. No liner materials used.

### **COST EFFICIENCY MEASURES**

- Combined disposal of compatible waste streams to maximize pit utilization
- Minimal soil testing to reduce operational delays
- Direct burial method selected over more expensive treatment options
- Utilization of on-site wetland areas for natural drainage management

---

## ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATIONS

### **GROUNDWATER CONDITIONS**

Water table observed at approximately 8-10 feet below surface during excavation operations. Seasonal high water conditions noted in late March due to snow melt. Some standing water encountered in disposal pits but operations continued as scheduled.

### **SOIL CONDITIONS**

Sandy loam soil conditions throughout disposal areas. Good drainage characteristics observed. Some clay deposits encountered at depth, particularly in Area 7 near the river tributary.

### **SURFACE WATER IMPACT**

Minor surface runoff noted during wet weather periods. Natural drainage patterns direct flow toward Aberjona River system. No significant accumulation of surface water observed at disposal sites.

---

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All disposal operations conducted in accordance with:
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines for industrial waste
- Local Woburn zoning requirements for industrial operations
- Standard industry practices for cost-effective waste management

No regulatory inspections conducted during March 1971 reporting period.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APRIL OPERATIONS

1. **Capacity Planning:** Current disposal sites approaching capacity. Recommend identification of additional burial areas on company property.

2. **Equipment Maintenance:** Bulldozer requires routine maintenance before next major disposal operation.

3. **Weather Considerations:** Monitor spring weather conditions for optimal excavation timing. Avoid operations during heavy rain periods when possible.

4. **Cost Management:** Continue emphasis on efficient disposal methods to maintain competitive pricing for waste management services.

---

## CONCLUSION

March 1971 operations successfully processed 847 drums of industrial chemical waste in a cost-effective manner. All materials disposed of on company property using established burial procedures. Operations completed within budget and schedule parameters. No significant operational difficulties encountered.

The Riley Company continues to provide essential waste management services to regional industrial operations, maintaining competitive pricing through efficient disposal methods and minimal regulatory overhead.
