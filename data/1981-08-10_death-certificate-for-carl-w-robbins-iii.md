**ADDITIONAL MEDICAL NOTES:**

Carl William Robbins III was first diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on March 12, 1979, at the age of 10 years and 10 months. The patient underwent standard induction chemotherapy protocol including vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase, achieving initial remission in June 1979. Maintenance therapy continued with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine.

The patient experienced his first relapse in November 1980, requiring intensified chemotherapy including daunorubicin and cytarabine. A second remission was achieved but proved short-lived. Final relapse occurred in May 1981, with blasts present in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. Despite aggressive salvage therapy, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly.

During his final hospitalization beginning July 15, 1981, the patient developed severe pancytopenia and opportunistic pneumonia. Family was present at the time of death. The patient's mother, Donna Robbins, was informed that the leukemia was refractory to all available treatments.

**Environmental History Note:** Patient resided at 47 Pine Street, Woburn, Massachusetts, since birth. Municipal water supply from Wells G and H. Mother reports exclusive use of tap water for drinking, cooking, and bathing throughout patient's lifetime.

**Family History:** No known family history of leukemia or other hematologic malignancies. Mother reports several neighborhood children with similar diagnoses.
