# WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## TECHNICAL TEST REPORT

**Report No:** WD-74-0805-FR  
**Test Date:** August 5, 1974  
**Report Prepared:** August 5, 1974, 1:15 PM  
**Technician:** Robert M. Sullivan, Water Systems Technician II  
**Supervisor:** Thomas F. McKenna, Water Department Supervisor

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Routine flow rate measurements were conducted on municipal Wells G and H on August 5, 1974, as part of the monthly monitoring protocol established by the Woburn Water Department. Both wells demonstrated operational flow rates within normal parameters, with Well G producing 850 gallons per minute (GPM) and Well H producing 920 GPM under standard operating conditions. These measurements support continued operation of both wells as primary sources for the East Woburn distribution system.

## WELL IDENTIFICATION AND LOCATION

**Well G:**
- Location: Industrial Park, off Salem Street
- Installation Date: May 1964
- Depth: 180 feet
- Casing Diameter: 12 inches
- Primary Service Area: East Woburn residential district

**Well H:**
- Location: Industrial Park, approximately 300 feet northeast of Well G
- Installation Date: September 1966
- Depth: 165 feet
- Casing Diameter: 12 inches
- Primary Service Area: East Woburn residential district, Montvale Road area

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

Flow rate measurements were conducted using the department's standard drawdown test procedure, established in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines for municipal water supply monitoring. Testing commenced at 9:30 AM with ambient temperature at 72°F and barometric pressure at 30.15 inches of mercury.

### Equipment Used:
- Siemens Model 4A flow meter (calibrated June 15, 1974)
- Standard pressure gauges (0-100 PSI range)
- Stopwatch timing devices
- Temperature measurement apparatus

### Test Procedure:
1. Wells operated at normal pumping capacity for 30-minute stabilization period
2. Flow measurements taken at 5-minute intervals over 45-minute test period
3. Static water level measurements recorded before and after testing
4. Pump efficiency calculations performed based on power consumption data

## ANALYSIS AND OBSERVATIONS

Both wells demonstrate consistent performance characteristics within expected operational parameters. Flow rates remain stable compared to previous monthly measurements, with no significant deviation from established baselines.

**Well G Performance:**
The well maintains its historical average of approximately 850 GPM, consistent with measurements recorded since initial operation in 1964. Drawdown characteristics indicate stable aquifer conditions with adequate recharge capacity. Minor fluctuations in flow rate (±5 GPM) fall within normal operational variance.

**Well H Performance:**
Well H continues to outperform design specifications, producing 920 GPM compared to the original design capacity of 800 GPM. This enhanced performance has been consistent since the well became operational in 1966. The slightly higher flow rate compared to Well G reflects the favorable geological conditions encountered during installation.

**Water Quality Observations:**
Visual inspection of water samples drawn during testing revealed clear, odorless water from both wells. No unusual discoloration, sediment, or organic matter observed. Water temperature remained consistent with seasonal groundwater temperature expectations.

**System Integration:**
Combined output from Wells G and H (1,770 GPM total capacity) continues to meet peak demand requirements for the East Woburn service area, which serves approximately 1,200 residential connections including the Montvale Road, Salem Street, and surrounding neighborhoods.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Continue Monthly Monitoring:** Maintain current schedule of monthly flow rate measurements to ensure early detection of any performance degradation.

2. **Pump Maintenance Schedule:** Both wells operating within normal parameters; next scheduled pump inspection due October 1974.

3. **Water Quality Testing:** Recommend continuation of quarterly bacteriological testing as required by state regulations. Next scheduled sampling: November 1974.

4. **Infrastructure Assessment:** Consider evaluation of distribution system capacity to accommodate potential future demand increases in East Woburn residential development.

5. **Record Maintenance:** Continue documentation of all operational parameters to establish long-term performance trends and support regulatory compliance requirements.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

This testing protocol satisfies Massachusetts Department of Public Health requirements for municipal water supply monitoring as outlined in 310 CMR 22.00. Flow rate measurements and operational data will be forwarded to the state office as part of the quarterly reporting requirement due September 30, 1974.
