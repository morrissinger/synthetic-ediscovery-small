## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This preliminary assessment examines the viability of potential toxic tort litigation arising from industrial chemical contamination of municipal water wells in East Woburn, Massachusetts, and an apparent cluster of childhood leukemia cases in the affected area. The tragic death of twelve-year-old James Anderson on January 18, 1981, following a nine-year battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia, has prompted his mother, Anne Anderson, to seek legal counsel regarding potential claims against industrial defendants whose operations may have contaminated the family's water supply.

Initial investigation reveals compelling evidence of both causation and liability against multiple corporate defendants, including W.R. Grace Company, Cryovac Inc., Beatrice Foods, and John J. Riley Company. The case presents significant challenges in terms of scientific proof and corporate resources but offers the potential for groundbreaking precedent in environmental tort law.

## II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. The Anderson Family

Anne Anderson has resided at 11 Orange Street in Woburn, Massachusetts, for seventeen years, raising three children: Christine (born 1962), Charles (born 1966), and James (born July 16, 1968). The Anderson household has consistently received municipal water from Wells G and H throughout the children's lives, including James's prenatal development and entire childhood.

James Anderson was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in January 1972 at age three. Despite nine years of medical treatment, hospitalizations, and chemotherapy, James succumbed to the disease on January 18, 1981. His siblings, Christine (now 20) and Charles (now 16), were raised in the same household, consuming the same water supply throughout their developmental years.

### B. Municipal Water System

Wells G and H, which served the Anderson neighborhood, commenced operations in 1964 and 1966, respectively. These wells drew groundwater that had been contaminated by industrial solvents, specifically:

- **Trichloroethylene (TCE):** Detected at concentrations up to 400 parts per billion (ppb), approximately 148 times the level associated with one additional cancer case per million exposed individuals
- **Tetrachloroethylene (PCE):** Detected at 43 ppb, well above acceptable exposure limits

The contamination occurred over an extended period, meaning that residents, including the Anderson family, were exposed to carcinogenic chemicals through drinking water, food preparation, bathing, and other household uses for years before the contamination was discovered and the wells were closed.

### C. Industrial Defendants

Preliminary investigation identifies four primary corporate defendants whose operations likely contributed to the groundwater contamination:

1. **W.R. Grace Company:** Chemical manufacturing operations with documented use and disposal of chlorinated solvents
2. **Cryovac Inc.:** Packaging materials manufacturer utilizing TCE and PCE in production processes
3. **Beatrice Foods:** Food processing operations with potential solvent disposal activities
4. **John J. Riley Company:** Industrial operations with suspected chemical waste disposal practices

Each defendant maintained facilities in proximity to the contaminated wells and utilized the specific chemicals detected in the groundwater during the relevant time periods.

## III. LEGAL ANALYSIS

### A. Causes of Action

**1. Negligence**
- Duty: Defendants owed a duty of reasonable care in handling, storing, and disposing of hazardous chemicals
- Breach: Improper disposal practices and inadequate containment measures constituted breach of duty
- Causation: Chemical contamination directly resulted from defendants' actions
- Damages: James Anderson's illness, suffering, medical expenses, and wrongful death

**2. Strict Liability for Abnormally Dangerous Activities**
- Industrial use and disposal of carcinogenic solvents constitutes abnormally dangerous activity
- Liability attaches regardless of reasonable care
- Policy justification: Industry should bear costs of inherently hazardous operations

**3. Nuisance**
- Private nuisance: Substantial interference with Anderson family's use and enjoyment of property
- Public nuisance: Contamination affected broader community water supply
- Continuing nuisance: Contamination persists in groundwater

**4. Trespass**
- Physical invasion of Anderson property through groundwater contamination
- Intent satisfied by knowledge that chemicals would migrate through groundwater

### B. Damages

**Economic Damages:**
- Medical expenses for James Anderson's treatment (1972-1981): Estimated $75,000-$100,000
- Lost future earnings: James Anderson's life expectancy and earning capacity
- Property diminution: Decreased value of Anderson residence due to contamination

**Non-Economic Damages:**
- Pain and suffering: James Anderson's nine-year illness
- Loss of consortium: Anne Anderson's loss of relationship with son
- Emotional distress: Family trauma from prolonged illness and death

**Punitive Damages:**
- Potential availability if evidence demonstrates willful misconduct or reckless disregard
- Corporate knowledge of contamination risks and continued operations

### C. Challenges and Risks

**1. Scientific Causation**
- Establishing causal link between specific chemical exposure and James Anderson's leukemia
- Competing theories of leukemia causation
- Latency period complications
- Dose-response relationship questions

**2. Corporate Resources**
- Defendants possess substantial financial resources for prolonged litigation
- Access to expert witnesses and technical consultants
- Potential for aggressive defense strategies

**3. Procedural Complexities**
- Multi-defendant coordination
- Discovery scope and costs
- Expert witness requirements
- Potential federal court jurisdiction issues

**4. Regulatory Considerations**
- EPA involvement and potential federal preemption issues
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health investigations
- Coordination with regulatory enforcement actions

## IV. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### A. Case Development Priorities

**1. Medical Documentation**
- Comprehensive review of James Anderson's medical records
- Consultation with pediatric oncology specialists
- Literature review on TCE/PCE and childhood leukemia

**2. Environmental Investigation**
- Hydrogeological studies of groundwater flow patterns
- Historical industrial operations research
- Chemical usage and disposal practice documentation

**3. Additional Plaintiffs**
- Investigation of other childhood leukemia cases in affected area
- Potential class action or mass tort coordination
- Community health impact assessment

### B. Settlement Considerations

Given the strength of the liability evidence and the compelling nature of the damages, defendants may be motivated to pursue early settlement discussions. However, the precedential value of this case for environmental tort law suggests that full litigation may be necessary to achieve adequate compensation and deterrent effect.

## V. RECOMMENDATIONS

**1. Case Acceptance:** This matter presents a strong foundation for toxic tort litigation with significant potential for both compensation and legal precedent.

**2. Expert Retention:** Immediate retention of qualified experts in:
   - Pediatric oncology and leukemia causation
   - Environmental chemistry and hydrogeology
   - Industrial chemical usage and disposal practices

**3. Discovery Strategy:** Aggressive pursuit of corporate documents regarding chemical usage, disposal practices, and knowledge of contamination risks.

**4. Community Outreach:** Investigation of additional affected families to strengthen case and potentially develop coordinated litigation.

**5. Regulatory Coordination:** Maintain communication with EPA and state health authorities while preserving independence of civil litigation.

## VI. CONCLUSION

The death of James Anderson represents a tragic consequence of industrial contamination that demands legal accountability. While this case presents significant challenges in terms of scientific proof and corporate opposition, the strength of the liability evidence and the compelling nature of the damages support proceeding with litigation. This matter has the potential to establish important precedent in environmental tort law while providing meaningful compensation to the Anderson family for their devastating loss.

The preliminary assessment supports immediate case development and formal representation of Anne Anderson in pursuing claims against the identified corporate defendants. Success in this matter would not only serve the interests of justice for the Anderson family but also establish crucial legal protections for
