# WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## WELLS G & H DAILY OPERATIONAL LOG

**Date:** October 4, 1971  
**Shift:** Day (6:00 AM - 2:00 PM)  
**Operator:** R. Sullivan  
**Weather:** Clear, 52°F  

---

### WELL G (Operational Status: ACTIVE)

**Activation Time:** 06:15 AM  
**Flow Rate:** 850 GPM (gallons per minute)  
**Static Water Level:** 88.2 feet  
**Pumping Water Level:** 92.6 feet  
**Drawdown:** 4.4 feet  

**Motor Performance:**
- Voltage: 480V
- Amperage: 42A
- No unusual vibration or noise detected

**Water Quality Observations:**
- Color: Clear
- Odor: None detected
- Taste: Normal (routine sample)
- Temperature: 48°F

**Maintenance Notes:**
- Lubricated motor bearings per weekly schedule
- Checked electrical connections - all secure
- Flow meter calibrated and reading normally

### WELL H (Operational Status: ACTIVE)

**Activation Time:** 06:30 AM  
**Flow Rate:** 920 GPM  
**Static Water Level:** 90.1 feet  
**Pumping Water Level:** 94.8 feet  
**Drawdown:** 4.7 feet  

**Motor Performance:**
- Voltage: 480V
- Amperage: 45A
- Slight bearing noise noted - schedule inspection

**Water Quality Observations:**
- Color: Clear with slight cloudiness initially, cleared after 10 minutes
- Odor: Faint chemical odor noted during startup, dissipated
- Taste: Normal (routine sample)
- Temperature: 49°F

**Maintenance Notes:**
- Initial turbidity cleared as expected during startup
- Chemical odor likely due to well sitting idle over weekend
- Recommend extended flushing period for future startups after 48+ hour shutdown

---

### SYSTEM INTEGRATION

**Combined Flow to Distribution:** 1,770 GPM  
**Reservoir Levels:**
- Main Reservoir: 85% capacity
- East Woburn Distribution: Normal pressure (65 PSI)

**Chemical Treatment:**
- Chlorine residual: 0.8 ppm (within acceptable range 0.5-1.2 ppm)
- pH adjustment: 7.2 (target range 6.8-7.5)
- Fluoride: 1.0 ppm (per state requirements)

---

### OPERATIONAL NOTES

Both wells brought online to meet increased demand due to maintenance work on Wells A and B. Wells G and H serving approximately 2,400 residential connections in East Woburn area, including Pine Street, Wood Street, Salem Street neighborhoods.

Water demand higher than typical for October due to Indian summer conditions. Residential usage patterns suggest normal domestic consumption - no industrial draws detected on system.

Wells G and H aquifer pressure remains stable. No interference between wells noted at current pumping rates. System performing within all operational parameters.

**Service Area Coverage:**
- Primary: East of Route 38 (Main Street)
- Secondary: Portions of central Woburn during peak demand
- Estimated population served: 8,200 residents

---

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

**State Department of Public Health Requirements:**
- Monthly bacteriological samples scheduled for October 15, 1971
- Quarterly chemical analysis due November 1971
- All current certifications valid through December 1971

**Quality Assurance:**
- Daily operator inspection completed
- No customer complaints received in past 24 hours
- Distribution system pressure maintained within specifications

---

### END OF SHIFT REPORT

**Shutdown Time:** Wells remain operational for evening shift  
**Total Runtime:** Wells G: 7 hours 45 minutes, Well H: 7 hours 30 minutes  
**Total Production:** Approximately 825,000 gallons  

**Issues for Follow-up:**
1. Schedule bearing inspection for Well H motor
2. Consider standard flushing protocol for wells after extended shutdown periods
3. Monitor chemical odor occurrence - document patterns if recurring

**Next Shift Notes:**
- Continue normal operation both wells
- Evening operator to check bearing noise on Well H
- Maintain current chlorination levels
