# PEDIATRIC LEUKEMIA CASE REPORT FOR STATE HEALTH REGISTRY

**TO:** Massachusetts Department of Public Health  
**FROM:** Dr. Sarah Williams, Chief of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology  
**DATE:** October 12, 1976  
**RE:** Mandatory Reporting - Pediatric Leukemia Cases, East Woburn Area

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents seven confirmed cases of pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed at Massachusetts General Hospital between 1973 and 1976, all patients residing within a concentrated geographic area of East Woburn, Massachusetts. The statistical clustering of these cases within such a limited geographic radius warrants immediate epidemiological investigation by state health authorities.

## CASE DOCUMENTATION

### Case #1: Michael Zona
- **Date of Birth:** March 15, 1966
- **Address:** 108 Montvale Road, Woburn, MA
- **Diagnosis Date:** June 12, 1973
- **Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)
- **Date of Death:** February 23, 1974
- **Age at Death:** 7 years, 11 months

Patient presented with classic ALL symptomatology including fatigue, pallor, and petechial hemorrhaging. Initial white blood cell count of 47,000/μL with 85% lymphoblasts confirmed diagnosis. Despite aggressive chemotherapy protocol including vincristine, prednisone, and methotrexate, patient experienced rapid disease progression. Family history negative for hematological malignancies. Parents report exclusive use of municipal water supply.

### Case #2: Kevin Kane Jr.
- **Date of Birth:** August 3, 1967
- **Address:** 267 Montvale Avenue, Woburn, MA
- **Diagnosis Date:** January 18, 1974
- **Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)
- **Current Status:** Deceased - March 8, 1975

Seven-year-old male presented with two-month history of recurrent infections and easy bruising. Laboratory findings revealed severe pancytopenia with circulating lymphoblasts. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed ALL with poor prognostic indicators. Patient resided approximately 0.3 miles from Case #1. Municipal water supply reported as primary source of household water consumption.

### Case #3: Patrick Toomey
- **Date of Birth:** November 22, 1968
- **Address:** 320 Montvale Avenue, Woburn, MA
- **Diagnosis Date:** August 5, 1974
- **Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)
- **Current Status:** Under active treatment

Six-year-old male diagnosed following presentation with fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Initial blast count of 52,000/μL. Currently in second remission following relapse in April 1976. Geographic proximity to previous cases noted during intake assessment. Family reports long-term residence in East Woburn area with municipal water consumption.

### Case #4: Carl Robbins III
- **Date of Birth:** February 14, 1969
- **Address:** 58 Maple Street, Woburn, MA
- **Diagnosis Date:** December 12, 1974
- **Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)
- **Current Status:** Under active treatment

Five-year-old male presented with progressive weakness and recurrent epistaxis. Diagnostic workup revealed ALL with CNS involvement requiring intrathecal chemotherapy. Patient residence within 0.5-mile radius of previously documented cases. Parents report exclusive municipal water usage since household establishment in 1967.

### Case #5: Roland Gamache
- **Date of Birth:** June 8, 1970
- **Address:** 12 Wildwood Street, Woburn, MA
- **Diagnosis Date:** March 20, 1975
- **Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)
- **Current Status:** Under active treatment

Four-year-old male diagnosed during routine pediatric examination revealing pallor and palpable lymphadenopathy. Laboratory confirmation of ALL with initial white count of 38,000/μL. Currently maintaining first remission. Geographic clustering with previous cases noted during epidemiological review. Municipal water supply confirmed as primary household source.

### Case #6: James Anderson
- **Date of Birth:** April 12, 1964
- **Address:** 96 Maple Street, Woburn, MA
- **Diagnosis Date:** July 8, 1975
- **Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)
- **Current Status:** Under active treatment

Eleven-year-old male presented with three-month history of fatigue and weight loss. Diagnostic evaluation revealed ALL with unfavorable cytogenetics. Patient has experienced multiple relapses despite intensive chemotherapy protocols. Residence within documented cluster area. Family reports long-term municipal water consumption.

### Case #7: Donna Robbins
- **Date of Birth:** September 30, 1971
- **Address:** 58 Maple Street, Woburn, MA
- **Diagnosis Date:** February 15, 1976
- **Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)
- **Current Status:** Under active treatment

Four-year-old female, sibling of Case #4, diagnosed during family screening following brother's diagnosis. Presents with standard-risk ALL currently in first remission. Second case within same household raises significant epidemiological concerns. Municipal water consumption confirmed.

## EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

The concentration of seven pediatric leukemia cases within a 0.8-mile radius in East Woburn represents a statistical anomaly requiring immediate investigation. The expected incidence rate for pediatric ALL is approximately 3-4 cases per 100,000 children annually. The observed clustering suggests an incidence rate exceeding 200 per 100,000 within this geographic area—a fifty-fold increase over expected rates.

### Geographic Distribution
All documented cases reside within the service area of municipal Wells G and H, which began operation in 1964 and 1966 respectively. The proximity of patient residences to these water sources, combined with the temporal clustering of diagnoses beginning in 1973, suggests a potential environmental exposure pathway requiring investigation.

### Temporal Clustering
The onset of cases beginning in 1973, approximately 7-9 years after wells G and H became operational, aligns with typical latency periods for environmentally-induced hematological malignancies in pediatric populations.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Environmental Investigation:** Comprehensive testing of municipal water supply, particularly Wells G and H, for known carcinogenic compounds including trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and other industrial solvents.

2. **Expanded Case Finding:** Active surveillance for additional pediatric leukemia cases within East Woburn area, including review of cases treated at other medical facilities.

3. **Epidemiological Study:** Formal case-control study to investigate potential environmental exposures, with particular attention to water consumption patterns and residential proximity to industrial facilities.

4. **Public Health Response:** Consider temporary cessation of Wells G and H operation pending comprehensive environmental assessment.

5. **Family Notification:** Establish protocol for notifying affected families of potential environmental health investigation while maintaining appropriate medical confidentiality.

## CONCLUSION

The unprecedented clustering of pediatric leukemia cases in East Woburn demands immediate and comprehensive public health response. The statistical impossibility of this concentration occurring by chance, combined with the geographic relationship to municipal water sources, strongly suggests environmental causation requiring urgent investigation and remediation.

This report fulfills mandatory reporting requirements under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 111B. Copies have been forwarded to the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency for federal oversight and technical assistance.
