# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** All Maintenance Department Staff  
**FROM:** Robert H. Mitchell, Plant Manager  
**DATE:** January 17, 1962  
**RE:** Revised Solvent Handling Procedures for Manufacturing Operations

## Purpose and Scope

This memorandum establishes mandatory procedures for the handling, storage, and disposal of industrial solvents used in our manufacturing processes at the Cryovac facility. These procedures are effective immediately and apply to all maintenance personnel involved in solvent-related operations, including but not limited to equipment cleaning, parts washing, and waste management activities.

Recent incidents involving improper solvent handling have necessitated a comprehensive review of our current practices. The safety of our workforce and the efficient operation of our manufacturing processes depend upon strict adherence to these established protocols.

## Authorized Solvents and Applications

The following solvents are authorized for use in maintenance operations:

- **Trichloroethylene (TCE)** - Primary degreasing agent for metal components and machinery cleaning
- **Perchloroethylene (PCE)** - Secondary cleaning solvent for specialized equipment maintenance
- **1,1,1-Trichloroethane** - Parts washing and vapor degreasing operations
- **Methylene Chloride** - Paint stripping and adhesive removal applications

All solvents must be obtained through the central supply system. Personnel are prohibited from bringing unauthorized cleaning agents onto the premises or mixing different solvent types without express written approval from the Plant Manager.

## Storage Requirements

### Primary Storage Areas
All bulk solvents shall be stored in the designated chemical storage building located in the northeast section of the facility. This area is equipped with proper ventilation systems and emergency containment measures. Storage containers must be clearly labeled with contents, date received, and handling precautions.

### Secondary Storage
Department-level storage is permitted for quantities not exceeding 55 gallons total per department. Secondary storage areas must be:
- Located away from heat sources and electrical equipment
- Equipped with appropriate fire suppression systems
- Maintained at temperatures below 80°F
- Inspected weekly by department supervisors

### Container Specifications
- Use only approved metal containers with tight-fitting lids
- Inspect containers monthly for signs of corrosion or damage
- Replace damaged containers immediately
- Maintain inventory logs for all stored materials

## Handling Procedures

### Personal Protection
All personnel handling solvents must wear:
- Chemical-resistant gloves (neoprene or nitrile)
- Safety goggles with side shields
- Long-sleeved work shirts and long pants
- Closed-toe leather work boots

### Transfer Operations
When transferring solvents between containers:
1. Ensure adequate ventilation in work area
2. Use approved pumping equipment - no siphoning by mouth
3. Ground all metal containers to prevent static discharge
4. Keep fire extinguisher readily accessible
5. Have spill cleanup materials immediately available

### Equipment Cleaning
For routine equipment cleaning operations:
- Use minimum quantity necessary to achieve cleaning objectives
- Work in well-ventilated areas whenever possible
- Avoid skin contact - use brushes and tools rather than direct hand contact
- Clean up spills immediately using approved absorbent materials

## Waste Disposal Procedures

### Temporary Storage
Used solvents and contaminated materials shall be collected in designated waste containers located at each work station. These containers must be:
- Clearly marked "WASTE SOLVENT - DO NOT MIX"
- Equipped with tight-fitting lids kept closed when not in use
- Emptied weekly or when 75% full, whichever occurs first
- Inspected daily for leaks or damage

### Collection and Consolidation
The Maintenance Department will consolidate waste solvents on Fridays of each week. All waste materials will be transferred to the central waste storage area behind the main manufacturing building. This area features:
- Concrete containment pad with drainage system
- Covered storage to protect from weather
- Secure fencing to prevent unauthorized access
- Monthly inspection by Plant Manager or designated representative

### Final Disposal
Accumulated waste solvents will be disposed of through our established waste management procedures. Current disposal methods include:
- **Incineration** - High-temperature burning of combustible waste solvents
- **Land Application** - Controlled application of certain waste materials to designated areas
- **Underground Disposal** - Injection of liquid wastes into approved subsurface locations

The Plant Manager will coordinate with local authorities as required to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. Disposal records will be maintained in the Plant Manager's office for a minimum of two years.

## Emergency Procedures

### Spill Response
In the event of a solvent spill:
1. Evacuate non-essential personnel from immediate area
2. Eliminate ignition sources
3. Contain spill using sand or approved absorbent materials
4. Notify Plant Manager immediately
5. Document incident in departmental log book

### Fire Emergency
If solvents are involved in a fire:
- Evacuate all personnel from affected area
- Sound general alarm
- Contact Woburn Fire Department (Madison 4-2200)
- Use foam or dry chemical extinguishers - NEVER use water on solvent fires
- Provide Fire Department with information about types and quantities of solvents involved

### Medical Emergency
For solvent exposure incidents:
- Remove affected person from exposure area
- Remove contaminated clothing
- Flush affected skin or eyes with clean water for minimum 15 minutes
- Contact company physician (Dr. Harold Stevens - Madison 4-1875)
- Transport to Woburn Hospital if serious symptoms develop

## Training and Compliance

All maintenance personnel must receive training on these procedures within 30 days of this memorandum. Training will be conducted by department supervisors and documented in personnel files. Refresher training will occur annually or following any significant procedural changes.

Supervisors will conduct monthly inspections of solvent handling practices and maintain written records of compliance. Any violations of these procedures will result in immediate retraining and may lead to disciplinary action.

## Questions and Clarifications

Personnel with questions regarding these procedures should contact their immediate supervisor or the Plant Manager's office (Extension 42). Suggestions for improving these procedures are welcomed and should be submitted in writing to the Plant Manager.

The success of our manufacturing operations depends upon the safe and efficient handling of the materials essential to our production processes. Your cooperation in implementing these procedures is essential to maintaining our facility's reputation for safety and quality.
