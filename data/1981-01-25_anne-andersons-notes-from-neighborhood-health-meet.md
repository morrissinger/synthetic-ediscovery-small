# Notes from Neighborhood Meeting - January 25, 1981

**Meeting at Murphy's house - 2:00 PM**

Present: Me, Pat Murphy, Carol Robbins, Mary Kane, Joan Zona, Rita Toomey, Mrs. Gamache, and a few others I didn't know well.

## What We Talked About

Pat started by saying she's been thinking about what Dr. Parker mentioned last month about the unusual number of sick children in our area. She brought up how her neighbor's boy has been having problems too, and it got us all talking about our kids.

**The Children We Know Are Sick:**
- My Jimmy - died last week (Jan 18) from leukemia, diagnosed when he was 3
- Kevin Kane Jr. - Mary's boy, also leukemia
- Michael Zona - Joan's son, leukemia 
- Patrick Toomey - Rita's child, leukemia
- Carl Robbins III - Carol mentioned he's been sick
- Roland Gamache - Mrs. Gamache's grandson

Mary Kane broke down crying when she talked about Kevin. She said the doctors keep telling her it's just "one of those things" but how can it be just coincidence when so many of our children are getting the same terrible disease?

## What We've Noticed

**About the Water:**
- Joan mentioned the water has tasted funny for years - metallic, chemical taste
- Carol said her family stopped drinking tap water last year because it smelled strange
- Pat's husband works for the city and said they opened new wells (Wells G and H) back in the 60s
- Rita asked if anyone else noticed the water sometimes looks cloudy

**About Our Neighborhood:**
- Most of us live within a few blocks of each other
- All our children played in the same areas growing up
- We've all been getting our water from the same city supply
- Mary pointed out that the Industri-Plex is just down the road from us

## Questions We Have

1. **Why are so many children in our small area getting leukemia?** The odds seem impossible.

2. **Is there something wrong with our water?** Several people mentioned problems with taste and smell.

3. **What chemicals might be in our water supply?** Pat's husband mentioned that companies dump things, but the city says the water is safe.

4. **Should we be worried about our other children?** Most of us have more than one child.

5. **Who can we talk to about this?** The doctors don't seem to take our concerns seriously.

## What We Decided to Do

**Immediate Steps:**
- Keep a list of all the children in our area who have been diagnosed with leukemia or other cancers
- Write down when each child got sick and where their families live
- Ask our husbands to find out more about the city water system
- Talk to other neighbors who weren't here today

**Longer Term:**
- Maybe contact the health department if we find more cases
- See if we can get someone to test our water
- Keep meeting regularly to share information

Pat said she would host the next meeting at her house in two weeks (February 8th). She's going to try to get more neighbors to come.

## Personal Thoughts

I keep thinking about Jimmy and wondering if I could have protected him somehow. If I had known the water was dangerous, I would have given him bottled water, moved away, done anything. But how were we supposed to know?

The other mothers understand in a way that people who haven't lost a child can't. We all have this terrible knowledge now - that something in our neighborhood is hurting our children, and we don't know what or how to stop it.

Carol mentioned that her husband knows someone who works at one of the companies near the Industri-Plex. She's going to see if she can find out what kinds of chemicals they use there.

I told everyone about how Jimmy was diagnosed so young - just 3 years old in 1972. Mary said Kevin was diagnosed around the same time. Joan's Michael was diagnosed in 1973. The timing seems important somehow.

**Things to Remember:**
- Bring a map to the next meeting to mark where all the sick children live
- Ask Christine and Charlie if they remember anything strange about the water when they were younger
- Try to remember exactly when the water started tasting different
- See if I can find out more about when those new wells opened

## Questions for Next Time

- Has anyone else noticed their pets getting sick?
- Are there other health problems in the neighborhood we should be tracking?
- How do we find out what companies are allowed to dump waste and where?
- Should we be contacting a lawyer?

The meeting ended around 4:30. Everyone seemed relieved to finally be talking about this with people who understand. We're not crazy for thinking something is wrong here. Too many of our children are sick for this to be normal.

I miss Jimmy so much. But maybe if we can figure out what happened to him, we can protect other children.
