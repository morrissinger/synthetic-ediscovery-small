Beatrice Foods tannery foreman noted satisfaction with service reliability and requested continuation of twice-weekly pickup schedule through summer months.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Site Management:** East pit approaching capacity, recommend scheduling cover operation within 14 days to maintain operational efficiency.

2. **Equipment Maintenance:** Unit 7 due for routine service next week. Schedule during low-demand period to avoid service disruption.

3. **Customer Service:** Consider offering volume discount to W.R. Grace for consistent high-volume business. Current rate structure may not reflect economies of scale for regular large shipments.

4. **Operational Efficiency:** Afternoon heavy loads require site crew assistance. Recommend coordinating timing with site supervisor to ensure adequate personnel availability.

### ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATIONS

Site drainage appears adequate following recent modifications to surface grading. No unusual odors or visible environmental impacts observed during disposal operations. Local wildlife activity minimal in immediate disposal area, consistent with previous observations.

**Water Management:**
Surface runoff control measures functioning as designed. No evidence of off-site migration of materials. Disposal pit locations selected to maximize distance from known water sources per established site plan.
