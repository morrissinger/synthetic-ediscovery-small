# DAILY WASTE DISPOSAL INSPECTION REPORT
## John J. Riley Company - Tannery Operations
### 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts

**Date:** April 15, 1927  
**Time:** 2:15 PM  
**Inspector:** Frank O'Malley, Floor Supervisor  
**Weather Conditions:** Clear, temperature 58°F  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This daily inspection report documents observations made during routine monitoring of waste disposal areas adjacent to our tannery facility. Of particular note is the continued expansion of soil discoloration in the southeastern disposal area, which has now extended approximately fifteen feet beyond the boundaries observed in last month's inspection. While operations continue without interruption, management attention is requested regarding the visual impact of these conditions.

## INSPECTION AREAS COVERED

### Primary Waste Disposal Area (Southeast Corner)
- **Location:** Approximately 200 yards southeast of main building
- **Size:** Roughly 40 feet by 60 feet
- **Primary Use:** Disposal of spent tanning solutions, lime slurry, and organic waste materials

### Secondary Holding Area (West Side)
- **Location:** Adjacent to railroad tracks, west boundary of property
- **Size:** Approximately 25 feet by 30 feet
- **Primary Use:** Temporary storage of solid waste materials prior to removal

### Storm Drainage Channels
- **Location:** Running east toward Aberjona River
- **Condition:** Clear flow, no visible blockages observed

## DETAILED OBSERVATIONS

### Soil Conditions - Southeast Disposal Area

The most significant observation during today's inspection concerns the continued spread of soil staining in our primary disposal area. The dark brown to black discoloration of soil, which has been present for several months, has now expanded noticeably since my last detailed measurement on March 18th. The stained area now measures approximately 55 feet in length and 45 feet in width, representing an increase of roughly 15 feet in the longest dimension.

The soil in this area exhibits a distinctly different coloration from surrounding ground, ranging from dark brown near the edges to nearly black at the center where our disposal activities are most concentrated. The texture of the affected soil appears somewhat different as well, with a somewhat oily consistency when examined with a stick during today's inspection.

Of note is that this staining pattern appears to follow the natural slope of the land, extending in a southeastern direction toward the wooded area that borders our property. The expansion seems most pronounced during periods following heavy rainfall, suggesting that water movement may be carrying materials from our disposal activities across a wider area of ground.

### Waste Material Assessment

Current waste streams being directed to the disposal area include:
- Spent chrome tanning solutions from our leather processing operations
- Lime-based hair removal compounds that have reached the end of their useful life
- Organic materials including hide trimmings and flesh removed during processing
- Cleaning solutions used for equipment maintenance
- Various chemical compounds used in the dyeing and finishing processes

The volume of materials being disposed of remains consistent with our production levels, which have increased by approximately 20% since the beginning of the year due to strong demand for our leather products. This increased production naturally results in proportionally increased waste generation.

### Water Management Observations

The drainage channels that carry rainwater runoff from our facility toward the Aberjona River continue to function adequately. No blockages were observed during today's inspection, and water flow appears normal for this time of year. Some discoloration of water in these channels is visible, particularly after periods of heavy rainfall, but this appears to be consistent with the nature of our industrial operations.

The natural drainage pattern of our property continues to direct surface water in an easterly direction toward the river, following the slope of the land. This drainage system has proven effective in managing both rainwater and the liquid components of our waste disposal activities.

## OPERATIONAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Current waste disposal practices do not appear to be impacting our production capabilities or worker safety in any measurable way. The disposal area remains accessible for continued use, and no unusual odors or conditions have been reported by workers in the vicinity.

The expansion of soil staining, while visually apparent, does not appear to present any immediate operational concerns. The affected area remains well within the boundaries of company property and is not visible from public roads or neighboring properties due to the natural screening provided by trees and vegetation along our property lines.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATION

### Short-Term Measures
1. Continue current monitoring practices with weekly visual inspections of the disposal area
2. Consider expanding the disposal area boundaries to accommodate the apparent spread of materials
3. Evaluate the possibility of establishing additional disposal locations to distribute waste materials more broadly across available property

### Long-Term Planning Considerations
1. Assessment of whether current disposal capacity will meet future production needs
2. Evaluation of alternative waste management approaches that might reduce the visual impact of disposal activities
3. Consideration of whether additional screening vegetation might be beneficial along property boundaries

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE NOTES

Current waste disposal practices continue to operate within the framework of accepted industrial standards for tannery operations. No specific regulations govern the disposal of tanning waste materials on private property, and our practices remain consistent with those employed by similar facilities throughout Massachusetts.

The Massachusetts Department of Health has not issued any specific guidance regarding tannery waste disposal, and our operations continue to follow industry-standard practices developed through decades of leather manufacturing experience.

## CONCLUSION

Today's inspection reveals continued normal operations with the noted expansion of soil staining in our primary disposal area. While this expansion represents a change from previous conditions, it does not appear to present any immediate operational or safety concerns. The affected area remains entirely within company property boundaries and does not impact our production capabilities.

Management may wish to consider the long-term implications of current disposal practices, particularly as production levels continue to increase. However, no immediate action appears necessary, and current operations may continue without modification.
