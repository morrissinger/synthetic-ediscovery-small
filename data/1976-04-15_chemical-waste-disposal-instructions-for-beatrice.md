# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Disposal Crew Workers  
**FROM:** Riley Tannery Supervisor  
**DATE:** April 15, 1976  
**RE:** Chemical Waste Disposal Instructions for Beatrice Property

Effective immediately, all disposal crews are to follow the revised procedures for handling chemical waste materials at the Beatrice Foods property located on New Boston Street. These instructions supersede previous verbal directions and must be followed without exception to maintain operational efficiency and cost controls.

**Disposal Locations and Procedures:**

All trichloroethylene (TCE) waste, perchloroethylene (PCE) waste, and associated solvents from tanning operations are to be disposed of in the designated areas behind the main Beatrice facility. The low-lying areas near the rear property line have been identified as suitable for liquid waste disposal due to the sandy soil conditions that allow for rapid absorption. Crews should focus disposal activities in the depression areas approximately 200 yards southeast of the main building, where natural drainage will facilitate waste processing.

**Timing and Frequency:**

Disposal runs should be conducted during evening hours, preferably after 6:00 PM when facility traffic is minimal. Weekend disposal is also acceptable and often preferable for larger volume loads. Crews are authorized to make disposal runs as frequently as necessary to prevent accumulation of waste materials at the tannery facility. The priority is maintaining clean operations at our primary location while utilizing the most cost-effective disposal methods available.

**Volume Guidelines:**

Standard disposal loads should not exceed 500 gallons per trip to avoid equipment strain and ensure proper handling. However, larger volumes may be disposed of when operationally necessary, particularly during peak production periods. Crews should coordinate with the supervisor for loads exceeding 750 gallons to ensure proper equipment allocation and timing.

**Equipment and Safety:**

Use standard transport trucks and avoid specialized containment equipment unless specifically required for particularly concentrated materials. Basic protective equipment is sufficient for routine disposal operations. Crews should work efficiently to minimize exposure time and complete disposal activities promptly.

This arrangement with Beatrice Foods provides significant cost savings compared to alternative disposal methods and should be utilized to its full capacity. Any questions regarding these procedures should be directed to the supervisor immediately. Compliance with these instructions is mandatory for all disposal crew personnel.
