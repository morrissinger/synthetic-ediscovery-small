## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

W.R. Grace & Co. hereby submits this environmental impact assessment in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 30, Section 61-62 and applicable regulations promulgated thereunder, regarding the proposed expansion of manufacturing operations at our Cryovac Division facility located at 201 Mishawum Road, Woburn, Massachusetts. This filing addresses the environmental considerations associated with increased production capacity for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) film products, including waste management protocols, air emissions, and water usage requirements.

The proposed expansion will increase manufacturing capacity by approximately 40% through the installation of additional extrusion lines and ancillary equipment. Current operations at the facility employ approximately 180 workers across three shifts, with the expansion anticipated to create an additional 65 permanent positions. The facility has maintained continuous operations since 1963, contributing significantly to the local economy while adhering to all applicable environmental regulations.

This assessment demonstrates that the proposed expansion can be accomplished in full compliance with current environmental standards and with minimal impact on surrounding communities. All waste management practices will continue to follow established protocols that have proven effective in protecting public health and environmental quality.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### Facility Overview

The W.R. Grace Cryovac Division facility occupies approximately 42 acres at 201 Mishawum Road in Woburn, Massachusetts, within an industrial zone designated for manufacturing use. The facility specializes in the production of barrier films and packaging materials utilizing advanced polymer chemistry and extrusion technologies. Primary products include food packaging films, industrial wrapping materials, and specialized barrier coatings for various commercial applications.

Current operations encompass four primary manufacturing buildings totaling 285,000 square feet, with supporting infrastructure including raw material storage, finished goods warehousing, maintenance facilities, and administrative offices. The facility maintains its own water supply through on-site wells and operates under permits issued by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for industrial water usage.

### Proposed Expansion

The expansion project consists of the construction of a new 45,000 square foot manufacturing building (Building E) and the installation of six additional polymer extrusion lines with associated cooling, winding, and quality control equipment. The new building will be constructed on the northeastern portion of the property, utilizing approximately 8 acres of currently undeveloped land within the existing facility boundaries.

Manufacturing processes in the expanded facility will mirror existing operations, utilizing established formulations and proven production methodologies. Raw materials will continue to include vinyl chloride monomer, vinylidene chloride, various plasticizers, and stabilizing agents, all of which are handled according to industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Waste Management Protocols

All manufacturing waste generated by the expanded operations will be managed through existing waste handling systems that have demonstrated effectiveness over nine years of continuous operation. Solid waste materials, including off-specification products and packaging waste, will continue to be collected by licensed waste management contractors for disposal at approved facilities.

Process waste streams, consisting primarily of cleaning solvents and equipment maintenance materials, will be managed through established protocols that ensure proper containment and disposal. The facility maintains detailed records of all waste streams and disposal activities in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health requirements.

Liquid waste from manufacturing operations, including equipment cleaning and process cooling water, will continue to be managed through on-site treatment and disposal systems. These systems have been designed and installed in accordance with applicable regulations and are regularly inspected to ensure continued compliance.

### Air Emissions Assessment

The proposed expansion will result in modest increases in air emissions consistent with the proportional increase in manufacturing capacity. All new equipment will be installed with appropriate emission control systems, including carbon adsorption units and thermal oxidizers where required by process characteristics.

Existing monitoring programs will be expanded to include the new manufacturing areas, ensuring continued compliance with air quality standards established by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Regular stack testing and ambient air monitoring will continue to demonstrate that facility operations do not pose risks to public health or environmental quality.

### Water Usage and Management

The expanded operations will require additional water for cooling and cleaning applications, with estimated usage increases of approximately 35% above current levels. All water requirements will be met through existing on-site wells, which have demonstrated adequate capacity and quality for manufacturing operations.

Wastewater from the expanded facility will be managed through existing treatment systems that have proven effective in meeting all applicable discharge standards. Regular monitoring of groundwater quality in the vicinity of the facility will continue to ensure that operations do not impact local water resources.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

### Permit Requirements

This filing addresses all permit requirements under Massachusetts environmental regulations, including air quality permits, water usage authorizations, and waste management approvals. The facility currently maintains all required permits in good standing and will obtain necessary amendments or additional permits as required for the expanded operations.

Regular inspections by Massachusetts Department of Public Health representatives have consistently found facility operations to be in compliance with applicable regulations. The proposed expansion will maintain this record of regulatory compliance through continued adherence to established protocols and procedures.

### Monitoring and Reporting

The facility maintains comprehensive environmental monitoring programs that will be expanded to cover the new manufacturing areas. These programs include regular sampling and analysis of air emissions, groundwater quality, and waste stream characteristics, with results reported to appropriate regulatory agencies as required.

All monitoring activities are conducted by qualified personnel using approved methodologies and certified analytical laboratories. The facility maintains detailed records of all environmental monitoring data and makes this information available to regulatory agencies upon request.

## COMMUNITY IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Economic Benefits

The proposed expansion will create approximately 65 permanent employment opportunities in the Woburn area, contributing to local economic growth and providing career advancement opportunities for current employees. The facility's continued growth demonstrates W.R. Grace's commitment to the local community and supports the city's industrial tax base.

Local suppliers and service providers will benefit from increased business activity associated with the expanded operations, creating additional indirect economic benefits throughout the region. The facility has maintained strong relationships with local businesses and will continue to source goods and services locally where practical.

### Public Health Considerations

The proposed expansion has been designed to maintain the facility's excellent record of protecting public health and safety. All manufacturing processes utilize proven technologies and established safety protocols that have demonstrated effectiveness over many years of continuous operation.

Regular health and safety training programs ensure that all employees are fully informed about proper handling procedures for all materials used in the manufacturing process.
