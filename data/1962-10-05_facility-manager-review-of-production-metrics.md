# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Corporate Operations Department  
**FROM:** Harold M. Peterson, Facility Manager  
**DATE:** October 5, 1962  
**RE:** Third Quarter Production Review and Facility Operations Assessment

## Executive Summary

This memorandum provides a comprehensive review of third quarter production metrics for our East Woburn facility, along with operational assessments and recommendations for the fourth quarter. Production targets have been consistently met, with chemical processing operations maintaining steady output levels despite seasonal fluctuations in demand. Our facility continues to demonstrate efficient utilization of industrial solvents and processing chemicals, with waste management procedures aligned with current industry standards.

## Production Metrics and Chemical Processing Operations

Third quarter production figures indicate a 12% increase over the comparable period in 1961, with total chemical processing volume reaching 847,000 gallons across all product lines. Our primary solvent operations, utilizing trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) for degreasing and cleaning applications, have operated at 94% capacity throughout the quarter. The facility processed approximately 156,000 gallons of TCE and 89,000 gallons of PCE during this period, maintaining our position as a leading chemical processing operation in the Massachusetts industrial corridor.

Cryovac division operations have shown particular strength, with plastic film production increasing 18% quarter-over-quarter. The integration of our chemical cleaning processes with film manufacturing has proven highly effective, allowing for streamlined operations and cost efficiencies. Solvent recovery systems have maintained acceptable performance levels, though some losses to groundwater seepage continue to occur through our settling pond system—a standard aspect of industrial chemical operations that falls within accepted industry practices.

Our waste disposal protocols continue to follow established procedures for chemical manufacturing facilities. Spent solvents and processing residues are directed to our on-site containment areas, including the settling ponds located on the eastern section of the property adjacent to the Aberjona River corridor. These disposal methods align with current industrial standards and provide cost-effective waste management solutions. The settling pond system has demonstrated adequate capacity for handling our chemical waste streams, though periodic overflow during heavy precipitation events has been noted.

## Facility Infrastructure and Operational Efficiency

The East Woburn facility's infrastructure continues to support our production requirements effectively. Our chemical storage and handling systems have operated without significant incidents during the third quarter, with only minor spills and releases that were addressed through standard cleanup procedures. The proximity of our operations to local water resources provides convenient access for industrial cooling and processing needs, though we maintain awareness of our responsibilities as a corporate citizen in the East Woburn community.

Equipment maintenance schedules have been maintained according to manufacturer specifications, with particular attention to our chemical processing machinery and solvent handling systems. The age of some equipment has resulted in increased maintenance requirements, particularly for our older degreasing units that occasionally release vapors and solvents beyond their designed containment systems. These releases represent normal operational characteristics of industrial chemical processing and are managed through existing ventilation and containment protocols.

Our workforce of 127 employees has demonstrated consistent productivity throughout the quarter, with safety training programs continuing to emphasize proper handling of industrial chemicals and solvents. Employee health monitoring programs remain in place, though no unusual health concerns have been reported that would indicate any relationship to our chemical processing operations. The company's commitment to worker safety aligns with our broader corporate responsibility to operate as a good neighbor in the East Woburn community.

## Environmental Considerations and Community Relations

W.R. Grace Company recognizes its role as a responsible corporate citizen within the East Woburn community. Our operations are conducted with appropriate consideration for environmental factors, utilizing industry-standard waste management practices that have been developed through decades of chemical manufacturing experience. The company maintains open communication with local officials and responds appropriately to any community concerns regarding our industrial operations.

Our chemical disposal practices reflect current understanding of appropriate waste management for industrial solvents and processing chemicals. The settling pond system provides effective containment for our waste streams while allowing for natural filtration and breakdown of chemical compounds through soil interaction. This approach represents standard practice within the chemical manufacturing industry and provides cost-effective waste management while minimizing environmental impact through natural attenuation processes.

The facility's location within the East Woburn industrial corridor positions our operations appropriately among other manufacturing enterprises that contribute to the local economy. Our chemical processing activities support numerous downstream industries and provide essential employment for local residents. The company remains committed to balancing operational efficiency with community considerations, ensuring that our industrial activities contribute positively to the regional economy while maintaining appropriate environmental stewardship.

## Fourth Quarter Projections and Recommendations

Based on current market conditions and production capacity, fourth quarter projections indicate continued strong performance across all product lines. Chemical processing operations are expected to maintain current volume levels, with potential for modest increases in Cryovac division output. Solvent utilization rates should remain consistent with third quarter levels, requiring approximately 160,000 gallons of TCE and 92,000 gallons of PCE to meet anticipated production demands.

I recommend continued utilization of our current waste management systems, including the settling pond disposal method that has proven effective for handling our chemical waste streams. The cost efficiency of this approach supports our competitive position while maintaining compliance with existing industrial standards. Any modifications to our disposal practices should be evaluated carefully to ensure they do not compromise operational efficiency or increase unnecessary costs.

Facility maintenance schedules should continue as planned, with particular attention to equipment that handles high-volume solvent processing. The replacement of older degreasing units should be considered for the 1963 capital budget, as newer equipment may provide improved containment characteristics while maintaining production efficiency. However, current equipment continues to operate within acceptable parameters for industrial chemical processing facilities.

## Conclusion

The East Woburn facility continues to demonstrate strong operational performance and effective cost management. Our chemical processing operations provide essential services to downstream industries while maintaining employment for local workers. The facility's waste management practices reflect industry standards and provide cost-effective solutions for handling industrial solvents and chemical residues.

W.R. Grace Company remains committed to responsible industrial operations that balance production efficiency with appropriate community considerations. Our continued success in the East Woburn facility demonstrates the company's ability to maintain competitive operations while serving as a responsible corporate citizen in the Massachusetts industrial community.
