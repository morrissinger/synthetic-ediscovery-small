## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Environmental Consulting Associates has completed a comprehensive review of historical solvent purchase and disposal practices at the W.R. Grace Company facility operated by Cryovac Inc. at 369 Washington Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts. This review was conducted in response to the May 1979 closure of municipal Wells G and H due to volatile organic contamination and covers the period from facility operations commencement through March 1980.

Our investigation reveals systematic patterns of solvent procurement, usage, and disposal that warrant immediate management attention and potential operational modifications. The facility's historical practices regarding trichloroethylene (TCE), methylene chloride, and other industrial solvents require documentation for regulatory compliance and risk management purposes.

Key findings indicate that disposal practices evolved significantly over the operational period, with early procedures lacking the environmental safeguards implemented in recent years. This report provides detailed analysis of procurement records, usage patterns, and disposal methodologies to support corporate decision-making regarding facility operations and environmental stewardship.

## METHODOLOGY

### Document Review Process

Our review encompassed examination of purchasing records, shipping manifests, inventory logs, and disposal documentation maintained by facility management from 1964 through 1979. We analyzed procurement patterns for the following chemical compounds:

- Trichloroethylene (TCE) - primary degreasing solvent
- Methylene chloride - secondary cleaning agent  
- Perchloroethylene (PCE) - specialized applications
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane - equipment maintenance
- Various petroleum-based solvents and cleaners

### Facility Operations Assessment

The Cryovac facility operates packaging machinery manufacturing processes requiring extensive metal cleaning and degreasing operations. Production volumes have increased substantially since facility establishment, with corresponding increases in solvent consumption. Current employment exceeds 100 personnel across manufacturing, maintenance, and administrative functions.

### Disposal Practice Documentation

Historical disposal practices were reconstructed through review of maintenance logs, contractor records, and facility management interviews. We examined both on-site disposal methods and third-party contractor arrangements utilized during different operational periods.

## FINDINGS

### Solvent Procurement Patterns (1964-1979)

#### Trichloroethylene Purchases

Annual TCE procurement has increased from approximately 2,400 gallons in 1964 to over 8,500 gallons in 1978, reflecting expanded manufacturing operations. Primary suppliers have included:

- Diamond Shamrock Chemical Company (Cleveland, Ohio)
- Dow Chemical Company (Midland, Michigan)  
- PPG Industries (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)

Procurement typically occurred in 55-gallon drums, with bulk deliveries (500+ gallon shipments) becoming more common after 1972. Storage capacity expanded from initial 440-gallon capacity to current 1,650-gallon capacity across multiple storage areas.

#### Secondary Solvent Usage

Methylene chloride usage averaged 1,200-1,800 gallons annually for specialized cleaning applications. Perchloroethylene consumption remained relatively stable at 800-1,200 gallons per year for equipment maintenance and precision cleaning operations.

### Historical Disposal Practices

#### Early Period (1964-1972)

During facility establishment and early operational years, solvent disposal practices reflected industry standards of the period. Waste solvents were typically collected in designated containers and periodically disposed of through various methods:

**On-Site Disposal:** Spent solvents were often disposed of in designated areas of the facility property. A shallow depression located in the northeastern section of the property served as a primary disposal location for liquid wastes. This area, approximately 30 feet by 50 feet, received regular deposits of waste solvents, cleaning solutions, and manufacturing byproducts.

**Evaporation Practices:** Contaminated solvents with high volatility were placed in open containers to allow natural evaporation. This practice was considered standard for managing recoverable solvents and reducing waste volumes.

**Drum Storage:** Non-recoverable waste solvents were stored in drums pending disposition. Storage areas included both indoor and outdoor locations, with outdoor storage becoming more common as volumes increased.

#### Transition Period (1972-1976)

Facility management began implementing more structured waste management procedures during this period. Changes included:

**Contractor Arrangements:** Third-party waste disposal contractors were engaged for periodic removal of accumulated waste materials. Primary contractors included regional haulers specializing in industrial waste management.

**Improved Storage:** Dedicated waste storage areas were established with improved containment measures. Concrete pads were installed for drum storage to prevent ground contact.

**Record Keeping:** Enhanced documentation of waste generation and disposal activities was implemented, though record retention practices varied.

#### Recent Period (1976-1979)

More stringent disposal practices were adopted in response to evolving regulatory requirements and corporate environmental policies:

**Licensed Disposal:** Exclusive use of licensed waste disposal contractors for off-site treatment and disposal of waste solvents.

**Manifest System:** Implementation of waste tracking manifests to document waste shipments and final disposition.

**Storage Upgrades:** Installation of improved storage facilities with secondary containment and leak detection capabilities.

### Environmental Considerations

#### Soil and Groundwater Interface

The facility's location within the Aberjona River Valley presents unique environmental considerations. The property's geology consists of glacial deposits overlying bedrock, with groundwater typically encountered at depths of 8-12 feet below surface grade. Historical disposal practices occurred in areas where direct soil contact was common.

#### Proximity to Water Sources

Municipal Wells G and H are located southwest of the facility property at distances of approximately 1,200 and 1,800 feet respectively. Groundwater flow patterns in the area generally trend toward the southeast, potentially creating hydraulic connections between facility operations and municipal water sources.

#### Waste Volume Estimates

Based on procurement records and manufacturing data, we estimate total solvent usage over the 15-year operational period at approximately 95,000 gallons of various compounds. Waste generation typically represented 15-25% of total solvent usage, suggesting cumulative waste solvent volumes of 14,000-24,000 gallons requiring disposal.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT

### Federal Requirements

Current federal regulations regarding hazardous waste management have evolved significantly since facility establishment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), enacted in 1976, established comprehensive requirements for hazardous waste generation, treatment, storage, and disposal that were not in effect during most of the facility's operational history.

### State and Local Requirements

Massachusetts environmental regulations have similarly evolved, with enhanced requirements for industrial waste management and groundwater protection. Local ordinances in Woburn have addressed industrial discharge and waste disposal practices, though enforcement mechanisms have varied over time.

### Documentation Requirements

Current regulatory frameworks require comprehensive documentation of waste generation, characterization, and disposal activities. Historical practices at the facility predate many of these requirements, creating potential compliance challenges for demonstrating environmental stewardship.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions

1. **Comprehensive Site Assessment:** Conduct detailed environmental assessment of historical disposal areas to characterize potential soil and groundwater impacts.

2. **Enhanced Record Keeping:** Implement comprehensive documentation systems for all current and future waste management activities.

3. **Storage Facility Upgrades:** Complete installation of secondary containment and monitoring systems for all solvent storage areas.

### Long-Term Considerations

1. **Alternative Technologies:** Evaluate solvent recovery and recycling technologies to reduce waste generation and disposal requirements.

2. **Process Modifications:** Assess manufacturing processes for opportunities to reduce solvent consumption through equipment upgrades or procedural changes.

3. **Monitoring Programs:** Establish routine environmental monitoring programs to verify effectiveness of current waste management practices.

### Legal and Risk Management

1. **Insurance Review:** Evaluate environmental liability insurance coverage in light of historical disposal practices and potential future claims.

2. **Legal Consultation:** Engage environmental legal counsel to assess potential liabilities associated with historical practices and develop appropriate risk management strategies.

3. **Stakeholder Communication:** Develop communication strategies for addressing community concerns regarding facility operations and environmental stewardship.

## CONCLUSIONS

The W.R. Grace Woburn facility's historical solvent management practices reflect the evolution of industrial environmental stewardship over a 15-year operational period. Early disposal practices, while consistent with industry standards
