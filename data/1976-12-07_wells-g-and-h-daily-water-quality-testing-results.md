# WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## Daily Water Quality Testing Results
### Wells G and H - December 1976

**TO:** Massachusetts Department of Public Health  
**FROM:** Robert J. Meehan, Superintendent, Woburn Water Department  
**DATE:** December 7, 1976  
**RE:** Monthly Water Quality Report - Wells G and H  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the daily water quality testing results for municipal Wells G and H for the month of December 1976, conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations and Safe Drinking Water Act requirements. Testing was performed by certified water department personnel using standard analytical procedures. All samples were collected during normal operational hours between 0800 and 1600 hours.

## WELL IDENTIFICATION AND SPECIFICATIONS

**Well G:**
- Location: Industrial Park, off Salem Street
- Depth: 180 feet
- Installation Date: May 1964
- Pumping Capacity: 400 gallons per minute
- Service Area: East Woburn residential district

**Well H:**
- Location: Industrial Park, adjacent to Well G
- Depth: 165 feet
- Installation Date: August 1966
- Pumping Capacity: 350 gallons per minute
- Service Area: East Woburn residential district

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected daily at 0800 hours from both wells using sterile collection bottles provided by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory. Samples underwent immediate field testing for basic parameters, with laboratory analysis conducted within 24 hours of collection. Testing protocols followed Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 14th Edition.

### Field Testing Parameters:
- pH measurement using calibrated portable meter
- Chlorine residual testing
- Temperature recording
- Visual inspection for color, odor, and turbidity
- Taste assessment (when safe to perform)

### Laboratory Analysis:
- Bacterial contamination (coliform testing)
- Chemical analysis for standard drinking water parameters
- Heavy metals screening
- Volatile organic compounds (when requested)

## DECEMBER 1976 TESTING RESULTS

### Well G Daily Results:

| Date | pH | Chlorine (mg/L) | Temp (°F) | Coliform | Odor | Color | Taste |
|------|----|-----------------|-----------|-----------|----- |-------|-------|
| 12/01 | 6.8 | 0.2 | 52 | Negative | Sweet/chemical | Clear | Metallic |
| 12/02 | 6.7 | 0.3 | 51 | Negative | Sweet/chemical | Clear | Metallic |
| 12/03 | 6.9 | 0.2 | 52 | Negative | Sweet/chemical | Clear | Metallic |
| 12/04 | 6.8 | 0.2 | 51 | Negative | Sweet/chemical | Clear | Metallic |
| 12/05 | 6.7 | 0.3 | 50 | Negative | Sweet/chemical | Clear | Metallic |
| 12/06 | 6.8 | 0.2 | 52 | Negative | Sweet/chemical | Clear | Metallic |

### Well H Daily Results:

| Date | pH | Chlorine (mg/L) | Temp (°F) | Coliform | Odor | Color | Taste |
|------|----|-----------------|-----------|-----------|----- |-------|-------|
| 12/01 | 7.1 | 0.3 | 53 | Negative | Slight chemical | Clear | Slightly metallic |
| 12/02 | 7.0 | 0.2 | 52 | Negative | Slight chemical | Clear | Slightly metallic |
| 12/03 | 7.2 | 0.3 | 53 | Negative | Slight chemical | Clear | Slightly metallic |
| 12/04 | 7.1 | 0.2 | 52 | Negative | Slight chemical | Clear | Slightly metallic |
| 12/05 | 7.0 | 0.3 | 51 | Negative | Slight chemical | Clear | Slightly metallic |
| 12/06 | 7.1 | 0.2 | 53 | Negative | Slight chemical | Clear | Slightly metallic |

## OBSERVATIONS AND FINDINGS

### Organoleptic Properties:
Both Wells G and H continue to exhibit unusual organoleptic characteristics that have persisted since initial operation. Well G demonstrates a pronounced sweet/chemical odor that has been consistent throughout 1976 testing. The metallic taste in both wells remains noticeable, though within acceptable parameters for public consumption according to current standards.

### Chemical Parameters:
pH levels remain within acceptable ranges for both wells, though Well G consistently tests slightly more acidic than Well H. Chlorine residual levels are maintained within required parameters for disinfection purposes.

### Bacterial Analysis:
All coliform testing results were negative throughout the testing period, indicating absence of bacterial contamination that would pose immediate public health risk.

### Physical Characteristics:
Both wells produce clear water with no visible turbidity or discoloration. Temperature readings are consistent with seasonal groundwater temperatures for the region.

## COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS MONTHS

The organoleptic characteristics observed in December 1976 are consistent with patterns documented throughout the year. The sweet/chemical odor in Well G has been persistent since mid-1975, with intensity varying slightly but never absent. Similar observations have been recorded by water department personnel since the wells became operational.

Residents in the East Woburn service area have occasionally contacted the water department regarding taste and odor concerns, particularly during summer months when consumption increases. Standard responses have advised that water meets all regulatory requirements for public consumption.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All testing results fall within parameters established by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and federal Safe Drinking Water Act requirements. No immediate action is required based on current testing protocols and standards.

### Compliance Status:
- **Bacterial Standards:** COMPLIANT - All coliform tests negative
- **Chemical Standards:** COMPLIANT - All parameters within acceptable ranges  
- **Physical Standards:** COMPLIANT - No turbidity or discoloration issues
- **pH Standards:** COMPLIANT - Levels within 6.5-8.5 range

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Continue Daily Monitoring:** Maintain current testing schedule for both wells to ensure ongoing compliance with public health standards.

2. **Resident Communication:** Consider developing informational materials regarding taste and odor characteristics to address occasional resident inquiries.

3. **Equipment Maintenance:** Schedule routine maintenance of testing equipment to ensure accuracy of field measurements.

4. **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive records of all testing results for regulatory reporting and trend analysis.

## CERTIFICATION

I hereby certify that the water quality testing results contained in this report were conducted in accordance with established procedures and regulatory requirements. All measurements and observations were recorded accurately by certified water department personnel.

The water supplied by Wells G and H during December 1976 met all applicable standards for public consumption as established by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
