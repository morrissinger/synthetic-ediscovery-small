# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Jan Schlichtmann, Esq.  
**FROM:** Legal Research Assistant  
**DATE:** November 18, 1981  
**RE:** Beatrice Foods Property Holdings Near Wells G and H - Initial Research Findings

## Executive Summary

Per your request following the tragic death of James Anderson on January 18, 1981, I have conducted preliminary research into Beatrice Foods Company's property holdings and potential industrial operations in the vicinity of Woburn's municipal Wells G and H. This memorandum summarizes findings relevant to establishing potential liability in the ongoing investigation of groundwater contamination and its connection to the childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn.

## Property Holdings and Corporate Structure

Beatrice Foods Company, headquartered at 120 LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois, maintains significant industrial operations in Massachusetts through various subsidiaries and direct ownership arrangements. Our records search has identified the following properties of interest within the groundwater flow patterns affecting Wells G and H:

**Primary Property of Interest:**
- **Address:** 264 Salem Street, Woburn, Massachusetts
- **Parcel ID:** Map 35, Lot 15-A (Middlesex County Registry of Deeds)
- **Ownership:** Beatrice Foods Company (direct ownership since 1962)
- **Size:** Approximately 15.2 acres
- **Current Use:** Industrial food processing and packaging facility
- **Zoning:** Industrial Manufacturing (M-2)

**Secondary Holdings:**
- **Address:** 280-290 Salem Street, Woburn, Massachusetts  
- **Ownership:** Held through subsidiary Meadow Gold Dairies, Inc.
- **Size:** 8.7 acres
- **Use:** Warehousing and distribution operations

## Proximity Analysis to Municipal Wells

The primary Beatrice Foods facility at 264 Salem Street is located approximately 1,200 feet northeast of Well H (opened 1966) and 1,800 feet from Well G (opened 1964). Based on United States Geological Survey topographical data and known groundwater flow patterns in the Aberjona River watershed, this property sits within the zone of contribution for both municipal wells. The facility's location places it directly upgradient from the wellfield, creating a potential pathway for contaminant migration through the sandy glacial deposits that characterize the local aquifer system.

## Industrial Operations and Waste Disposal Practices

Through interviews with former employees and review of available records, we have identified several concerning practices at the Beatrice Foods facility that may be relevant to our causation analysis:

**Chemical Usage:**
The facility has historically utilized industrial solvents for equipment cleaning and degreasing operations, including trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE). These same chemicals have been detected in Wells G and H at concentrations of up to 400 parts per billion (TCE) and 43 parts per billion (PCE) respectively.

**Waste Disposal Methods:**
Former employees report that waste solvents and cleaning solutions were routinely disposed of in several ways:
- Direct discharge to floor drains connected to unlined sumps
- Disposal in drums stored in outdoor areas without secondary containment
- Periodic burning of waste materials in on-site burn pits
- Discharge to the facility's septic system, which connects to a leach field located within 800 feet of Well H

## Regulatory History and Compliance Issues

Our review of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering files reveals several compliance issues at the Beatrice Foods facility:

**1978 Inspection Report:** State inspectors noted "improper storage of chemical waste materials" and "potential for groundwater contamination from uncontained spills." The company was issued a Notice of Non-Compliance but no follow-up enforcement action was taken.

**1979 Groundwater Monitoring:** Beatrice Foods was required to install monitoring wells following complaints from neighboring property owners about chemical odors. Results from these wells, if available, could provide crucial evidence of contamination originating from the facility.

**Federal Filings:** Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), implemented in 1976, Beatrice Foods filed as a small quantity generator of hazardous waste, reporting annual generation of less than 1,000 kilograms. However, employee accounts suggest actual waste generation may have exceeded reported quantities.

## Potential Legal Theories and Evidentiary Support

**Negligence Claims:**
The evidence suggests multiple potential breaches of duty of care:
- Failure to properly contain and dispose of hazardous chemicals
- Inadequate maintenance of waste storage systems
- Failure to implement appropriate environmental monitoring
- Continued operations despite knowledge of potential contamination risks

**Causation Elements:**
To establish causation linking Beatrice Foods' operations to the contamination of Wells G and H, we will need to demonstrate:
- The facility's use and disposal of TCE and PCE chemicals
- Migration pathways from the facility to the municipal wells
- Timeline correlation between disposal activities and well contamination
- Exclusion of other potential contamination sources in the area

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Document Discovery:** Issue preservation notices to Beatrice Foods for all records related to chemical usage, waste disposal, and environmental monitoring at the Salem Street facility from 1964 to present.

2. **Expert Consultation:** Retain hydrogeological and environmental engineering experts to analyze groundwater flow patterns and contaminant transport mechanisms between the facility and Wells G and H.

3. **Employee Interviews:** Conduct formal depositions of former Beatrice Foods employees who have knowledge of waste disposal practices, particularly those working in maintenance and environmental compliance roles.

4. **Regulatory File Review:** Obtain complete files from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering, EPA Region I, and local health departments regarding the Beatrice Foods facility.

5. **Property History Research:** Investigate the complete chain of title for the Salem Street property to identify any previous industrial uses that might complicate causation arguments.

## Conclusion

The preliminary evidence suggests that Beatrice Foods Company maintained industrial operations in close proximity to Wells G and H that involved the use and disposal of the same chemicals found in the contaminated municipal water supply. The company's waste disposal practices, as described by former employees and documented in regulatory files, appear to have created multiple pathways for groundwater contamination. While additional investigation is required to establish definitive causation, Beatrice Foods should be considered a significant defendant in any litigation arising from the contamination of Woburn's water supply and its connection to the childhood leukemia cases, including the tragic death of James Anderson.

The corporate defendant's substantial assets and insurance coverage also make it an attractive target for recovery of damages on behalf of the affected families. I recommend proceeding with formal discovery and expert analysis to strengthen our causation case against Beatrice Foods Company.
