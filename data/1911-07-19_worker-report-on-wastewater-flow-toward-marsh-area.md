# WORKER REPORT ON WASTEWATER FLOW TOWARD MARSH AREAS

**TO:** William Patterson, Site Foreman  
**FROM:** Michael O'Brien, Floor Supervisor  
**DATE:** July 19, 1911  
**RE:** Observations of Tanning Waste Discharge and Flow Patterns

## Executive Summary

This report documents my observations regarding the current discharge patterns of tanning wastewater from our Salem Street facility and the subsequent flow of these materials toward the marsh areas east of our property. Based on my daily inspections of the tanning floor operations and waste management systems, I have identified several areas of concern that warrant immediate attention from management.

## Background and Facility Operations

The John J. Riley Company tannery has been in continuous operation since 1909, processing approximately 200-300 animal hides per week through our standard chrome tanning process. Our current operations utilize chromium sulfate solutions, lime liquors, and various organic compounds including tannic acid extracts in the leather processing sequence. The facility generates substantial quantities of liquid waste as a natural byproduct of the tanning process, including spent chrome solutions, lime-saturated water, and organic matter from hide preparation.

Our current waste management system consists of settling tanks located on the western portion of the property, designed to allow solid matter to precipitate before liquid discharge. The overflow from these tanks has historically been directed toward the natural drainage patterns that lead eastward toward the Aberjona River and associated wetland areas.

## Current Discharge Observations

### Volume and Frequency

During the period from July 1 through July 18, 1911, I have observed consistent daily discharge of tanning wastewater from our primary settling tanks. The volume appears to have increased substantially since the spring months, coinciding with our expanded production schedule to meet summer delivery contracts. On average, I estimate the facility discharges approximately 800-1,200 gallons of liquid waste daily, with peak discharge occurring during mid-afternoon hours when the morning's tanning operations reach the rinse and wash stages.

### Flow Patterns and Direction

The discharged wastewater follows natural topographical gradients, flowing eastward from our property toward the marsh areas adjacent to the Aberjona River. I have traced this flow pattern on multiple occasions and can confirm that the waste stream maintains a consistent eastward trajectory, passing through a series of small drainage channels and depressions in the terrain before reaching the wetland areas approximately 400 yards from our facility.

The flow rate appears to be influenced by seasonal rainfall patterns, with recent dry conditions causing the waste stream to move more slowly and concentrate in low-lying areas. During periods of heavy rainfall, the discharge mixes with surface runoff and moves more rapidly toward the river system.

### Physical Characteristics of Discharge

The wastewater exhibits distinctive visual characteristics that make its progress easily traceable across the landscape. The liquid maintains a reddish-brown coloration typical of chrome tanning solutions, with occasional greenish tints when copper-based compounds are utilized in specialty leather processing. The discharge often carries suspended particulate matter, including organic debris from hide processing and precipitated chemical compounds.

I have observed that the wastewater creates distinct staining patterns on soil and vegetation along its flow path. Grass and other plant matter in contact with the discharge show signs of discoloration and, in some cases, apparent deterioration. The soil in areas of regular contact with the waste stream has developed a characteristic reddish-brown staining that persists even during dry periods.

## Marsh Area Impact Assessment

### Vegetation Changes

My observations of the marsh areas receiving our discharge have revealed noticeable changes in vegetation patterns over the past eighteen months. Areas that previously supported dense growth of cattails and other wetland plants now show patches of reduced vegetation density. The remaining plant growth in these areas often displays unusual coloration, with leaves showing brown edges and stunted growth patterns.

### Water Quality Observations

The water in marsh areas receiving our discharge has developed a distinctive appearance and odor. The natural marsh water, which was previously clear to slightly turbid, now shows consistent discoloration ranging from pale brown to deep reddish-brown, depending on recent discharge volumes. A chemical odor, reminiscent of the tanning solutions used in our facility, is detectable in these areas, particularly during warm weather conditions.

### Wildlife Activity

I have noted changes in wildlife activity in the affected marsh areas. Bird populations that previously frequented these wetlands appear to have diminished, and I have observed fewer waterfowl in areas where our discharge is most concentrated. Small mammal activity also appears reduced in the immediate vicinity of the waste stream flow path.

## Recommendations and Considerations

### Immediate Actions

Based on these observations, I recommend that management consider implementing additional settling capacity to reduce the volume and concentration of materials being discharged toward the marsh areas. The installation of additional holding tanks or expansion of existing settling facilities could provide greater treatment time and reduce the impact on surrounding lands.

### Long-term Planning

The company should consider alternative disposal methods for tanning wastes that would reduce or eliminate discharge toward the marsh areas. Potential alternatives might include arrangements with other industrial facilities for waste sharing, or investigation of alternative discharge locations that would not impact the sensitive wetland environment east of our property.

### Monitoring Protocol

I recommend establishing a regular monitoring schedule to document changes in discharge patterns and environmental impact. Weekly inspections of the flow path and marsh areas would provide valuable information for assessing the effectiveness of any implemented improvements.

## Conclusion

The current wastewater discharge from our tanning operations is following predictable flow patterns eastward toward marsh areas adjacent to the Aberjona River. While this discharge represents standard practice for tanning operations of our scale, the cumulative impact on vegetation and water quality in the receiving areas suggests that management attention to waste handling procedures would be prudent.

I remain available to discuss these observations in greater detail and to assist with any investigation or improvement efforts that management may wish to undertake.
