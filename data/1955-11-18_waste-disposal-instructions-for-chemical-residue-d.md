## IMMEDIATE DISPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHEMICAL RESIDUE DRUMS

### BACKGROUND

Effective immediately, all workers are to follow the revised procedures outlined below for disposal of accumulated chemical waste drums currently stored in the rear staging area adjacent to the railroad tracks. Management has determined that the current storage capacity has reached maximum levels and immediate disposal action is required to maintain operational efficiency.

The drums in question contain residues from our standard tanning operations, including but not limited to chromium sulfate solutions, vegetable tanning extracts, sodium sulfide preparations, and various degreasing solvents used in hide preparation processes. These materials have accumulated over the past eighteen months of increased production to meet contract obligations with Boston-area leather goods manufacturers.

### DISPOSAL PROCEDURES

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **Drum Identification:** All drums marked with yellow paint stripes (approximately 47 drums total) are to be moved from the rear staging area beginning Monday morning, November 21st, 1955.

2. **Transportation Method:** Use the company flatbed truck for transport. Load no more than 8 drums per trip to prevent overloading. Secure drums with rope and canvas covering as standard procedure.

3. **Disposal Location:** Transport drums to the designated disposal area located approximately 300 yards southeast of the main tannery building, in the low-lying area between our property line and the marshy ground near the Aberjona River. This location has been selected for its distance from active work areas and its natural depression which will contain any spillage.

4. **Disposal Method:** 
   - Remove drum lids using standard pry bars
   - Pour contents directly onto the ground in the designated area
   - Spread contents using shovels to ensure even distribution and faster absorption into soil
   - Stack empty drums in the northeast corner of the disposal area for potential future use

5. **Safety Precautions:**
   - Wear rubber boots and work gloves during all disposal activities
   - Avoid direct skin contact with drum contents
   - Work in pairs - do not perform disposal activities alone
   - Complete all disposal work during daylight hours only

### SCHEDULING

This disposal operation must be completed within one week of this work order issuance. The following schedule will be observed:

- **Monday, November 21:** Drums 1-16
- **Tuesday, November 22:** Drums 17-32  
- **Wednesday, November 23:** Drums 33-47
- **Thursday, November 24:** HOLIDAY - No disposal activities
- **Friday, November 25:** Complete any remaining drums and area cleanup

### OPERATIONAL NECESSITY

This disposal action is necessary to maintain our production schedule and meet delivery commitments for the upcoming winter season. The rear staging area must be cleared to accommodate incoming shipments of raw hides scheduled for delivery beginning December 1st, 1955. Management has determined that this disposal method represents the most cost-effective solution for maintaining operational efficiency while addressing our immediate storage capacity limitations.

The selected disposal location provides adequate distance from our primary work areas while utilizing naturally occurring low ground that will contain materials and prevent interference with neighboring properties. The marshy characteristics of the disposal area will facilitate natural breakdown of organic tanning materials over time.

### WORKER RESPONSIBILITIES

All floor workers assigned to this disposal operation are responsible for:

- Following these instructions precisely as written
- Maintaining work pace to complete disposal within the designated timeframe
- Reporting any equipment problems or safety concerns immediately to floor supervision
- Ensuring proper cleanup of the staging area upon completion of disposal activities

Workers who fail to follow these procedures or who create delays in the disposal timeline will be subject to disciplinary action including potential suspension without pay.

### CONFIDENTIALITY

These disposal activities are internal company operations and are not to be discussed with individuals outside of the Riley Company organization. Workers are specifically instructed not to discuss disposal methods or locations with family members, neighbors, or other community members. This instruction is necessary to prevent interference with our business operations and to maintain competitive advantages in our manufacturing processes.

Any worker found discussing company disposal operations with outside parties will face immediate termination.

### COMPLETION REPORTING

Upon completion of all disposal activities, the assigned crew leader will provide a written report to management confirming:

- Total number of drums processed
- Completion date and time
- Any incidents or equipment problems encountered
- Condition of the disposal area following completion

This work order supersedes all previous waste handling instructions and remains in effect until further notice from management.
