# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Maintenance Crew - Building 12  
**FROM:** Harold F. Mitchell, Production Supervisor  
**DATE:** August 14, 1967  
**RE:** Work Order for Solvent Waste Disposal at Northeast Property Line

This memo serves as authorization for immediate disposal of accumulated solvent waste materials currently stored in drums behind Building 12. Due to increased production demands this month, we have generated approximately 45 drums of mixed organic solvents including trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and methylene chloride from our cleaning operations.

**Disposal Instructions:**

Effective immediately, transport all drums to the northeast corner of the property adjacent to the wooded area near the Aberjona River marsh. Dig trenches approximately 4 feet deep and 6 feet wide to accommodate the waste materials. Empty drum contents directly into trenches and backfill with available soil and debris. This location has been selected due to its distance from main facility operations and convenient access via the service road. The natural drainage in this area will help disperse materials into the groundwater system, eliminating any surface accumulation concerns.

**Safety Precautions:**

Ensure all personnel wear standard work gloves and avoid prolonged skin contact with waste materials. Complete disposal operations during daylight hours and avoid working in wet conditions. No smoking or open flames permitted during disposal activities. Return empty drums to Building 12 for future use where possible.

This disposal method has been approved by plant management and represents the most cost-effective solution for our current waste volume. Complete all disposal activities by August 18, 1967, to maintain production schedules. Any questions or concerns should be directed to my office immediately.

The continued efficiency of our manufacturing operations depends on prompt waste management. I trust this work order will receive your immediate attention and professional execution.
