# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** File  
**FROM:** Robert M. Henshaw, Operations Director  
**DATE:** August 3, 1970  
**RE:** Operations Director Review Notes on Facility Resource Management

## Current Facility Operations Assessment

Following my review of our Woburn facility operations for the second quarter of 1970, I am documenting several observations regarding our current resource management practices and operational efficiency measures. These notes are intended to serve as a baseline assessment for future operational planning and to identify areas where we can optimize our manufacturing processes while maintaining cost-effective operations.

Our primary manufacturing operations continue to focus on polyethylene film production for food packaging applications, with secondary operations including experimental polymer development and specialty chemical processing. The facility currently operates three production lines with varying capacity utilization rates, averaging approximately 78% capacity across all lines during the review period. Production output has remained consistent with projections, and we have successfully maintained delivery schedules to our major customers including several regional food processing companies.

## Waste Management and Disposal Protocols

Current waste management procedures involve the separation of solid manufacturing waste from liquid chemical byproducts generated during our polymer processing operations. Solid waste materials, primarily consisting of off-specification polyethylene film and packaging materials, are collected by contracted waste haulers on a bi-weekly schedule and transported to approved disposal sites in accordance with standard industry practices.

Liquid waste streams, including spent solvents and chemical cleaning agents used in our manufacturing processes, are currently managed through on-site containment and periodic disposal. Our maintenance staff has established collection points near each production line where these materials are temporarily stored in appropriate containers before final disposition. The primary solvents involved in our operations include trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE), which are essential for equipment cleaning and degreasing operations. These materials are collected in 55-gallon drums and stored in our rear facility area pending disposal arrangements.

## Facility Infrastructure and Maintenance

The physical infrastructure of our Woburn facility continues to meet our operational requirements, though several areas have been identified for potential improvement. The main production floor drainage system has performed adequately, though periodic maintenance is required to ensure proper flow during equipment cleaning operations. Our maintenance team has noted that the concrete flooring in the rear facility area shows some signs of surface deterioration, likely due to normal industrial use and exposure to cleaning chemicals.

Groundwater monitoring is not currently part of our standard facility maintenance protocols, as this falls outside typical manufacturing facility requirements. However, we maintain awareness of general environmental conditions in the area and coordinate with local authorities as needed regarding any facility-related matters. Our focus remains on maintaining efficient operations while adhering to applicable safety and operational standards.

## Recommendations for Operational Optimization

Based on this review, I recommend several measures to enhance our operational efficiency and resource utilization. First, we should consider consolidating our liquid waste collection procedures to reduce handling frequency and improve cost effectiveness. Currently, our disposal arrangements involve multiple contractors and varying schedules, which creates inefficiencies in our waste management costs.

Second, we should evaluate opportunities to increase utilization of our rear facility area for expanded storage of raw materials and finished goods. This area currently serves multiple functions including waste staging, but with improved organization we could better utilize this space for inventory management purposes.

Finally, I recommend establishing more detailed record-keeping procedures for our facility resource management activities. While our current documentation meets operational requirements, enhanced record-keeping would provide better data for future planning and cost analysis purposes. This would include more detailed tracking of material usage, waste generation volumes, and disposal costs across our various production operations.

## Conclusion

Our Woburn facility operations continue to perform effectively within established parameters, and current resource management practices are meeting immediate operational needs. The recommendations outlined above represent opportunities for incremental improvements rather than corrections to operational deficiencies. Implementation of these measures should be considered as part of our ongoing facility optimization efforts, with timing dependent on available resources and operational priorities.

I will continue to monitor facility operations and provide updated assessments on a quarterly basis. Any significant changes to our manufacturing processes or facility requirements will be documented through appropriate channels and communicated to relevant personnel as needed.
