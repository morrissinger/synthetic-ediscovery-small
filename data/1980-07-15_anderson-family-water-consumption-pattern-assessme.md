# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** DPH Epidemiology Unit  
**FROM:** Dr. Patricia Hennessey, Environmental Health Specialist  
**DATE:** July 15, 1980  
**RE:** Anderson Family Water Consumption Pattern Assessment - Wells G and H Exposure Analysis

## Background and Methodology

Following the May 1979 closure of municipal Wells G and H due to volatile organic compound contamination, this department has conducted detailed exposure assessments for affected families in the East Woburn area. The Anderson family case presents a particularly significant example of prolonged exposure patterns that warrant documentation for our ongoing epidemiological investigation.

The Anderson household at 52 Meadowbrook Avenue received municipal water service exclusively from the Wells G and H distribution system from September 1964 through May 1979. During this fifteen-year period, the family's water consumption patterns were documented through interviews with Anne Anderson and cross-referenced with municipal billing records obtained from the Woburn Water Department.

## Consumption Pattern Analysis

Our assessment reveals that the Anderson family maintained higher than average water consumption throughout the exposure period. Daily household usage averaged 280 gallons, significantly above the municipal average of 185 gallons per household. This elevated consumption resulted from several contributing factors: a household of five family members, regular lawn irrigation during summer months, and Mrs. Anderson's practice of preparing all meals and beverages using tap water rather than purchased alternatives.

Of particular concern is the exposure pattern for James Anderson, born in 1966, who consumed Wells G and H water from birth through age thirteen. Medical records indicate that James was exclusively bottle-fed using formula prepared with tap water, representing a concentrated exposure pathway during critical developmental periods. The family reported no use of water filtration systems or alternative water sources during the exposure period, confirming that all domestic consumption originated from the contaminated municipal supply.

## Health Timeline Correlation

James Anderson was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in January 1979, four months prior to the well closure. The timing of this diagnosis, combined with the documented exposure history, establishes a clear temporal relationship between contaminated water consumption and the onset of illness. Medical records from Massachusetts General Hospital confirm the diagnosis date and treatment protocol, providing objective documentation of the health outcome.

The Anderson case demonstrates the type of prolonged, high-level exposure that our epidemiological models suggest could establish causation between the Wells G and H contamination and childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn. This exposure assessment will be incorporated into our comprehensive health study currently being prepared for the Environmental Protection Agency's review.

## Recommendations

I recommend that the Anderson family exposure data be classified as a priority case study in our ongoing investigation. The documented consumption patterns, combined with the clear temporal relationship between exposure and diagnosis, provide strong evidence supporting the causal relationship between industrial contamination and community health impacts. This case should be referenced in any legal proceedings involving the responsible industrial parties, as it demonstrates both the extent of community exposure and the failure of industrial operators to prevent groundwater contamination that resulted in documented health consequences.
