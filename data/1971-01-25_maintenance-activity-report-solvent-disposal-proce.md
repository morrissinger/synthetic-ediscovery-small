# MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY REPORT

**TO:** Cryovac Maintenance Supervisor  
**FROM:** Thomas Sullivan, Maintenance Technician  
**DATE:** January 25, 1971  
**RE:** Solvent Disposal Procedure - Weekly Report

## Summary of Activities

This report documents maintenance activities conducted during the week of January 18-22, 1971, with particular attention to solvent handling and disposal procedures as requested in your memo dated January 15, 1971.

## Solvent Disposal Operations

During the reporting period, maintenance operations generated approximately 85 gallons of waste solvents from routine equipment cleaning and degreasing activities. The waste consisted primarily of trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and mixed petroleum distillates used in the cleaning of production machinery and metal components.

Current disposal procedures followed established protocols as outlined in the facility operations manual. Waste solvents were collected in standard 55-gallon drums and temporarily stored in the designated area behind Building 3, adjacent to the loading dock. As per standard practice, accumulated waste was disposed of through ground disposal methods in the designated area approximately 200 yards northeast of the main production facility.

The disposal site, which has been utilized for this purpose since facility operations began, consists of an excavated area approximately 15 feet by 20 feet, with a depth of 8 feet. The site is located in sandy soil conditions which facilitate rapid absorption of liquid waste materials. This method has proven effective in managing waste volumes while maintaining cost efficiency for the facility.

## Equipment Maintenance

Regular maintenance was performed on degreasing equipment in Buildings 2 and 3. The vapor degreasing unit in Building 2 required cleaning of the condensation system, which generated approximately 12 gallons of contaminated solvent that was added to the weekly disposal total. The unit has been operating within normal parameters following this maintenance.

The parts washing station in Building 3 underwent routine solvent replacement, with 25 gallons of fresh TCE added to replace depleted cleaning solution. The used solvent, totaling approximately 30 gallons, was drummed for disposal along with other waste materials.

## Observations and Recommendations

The current disposal method continues to handle waste volumes effectively. The sandy soil conditions at the disposal site provide excellent drainage characteristics, and there have been no observable accumulation issues or surface contamination in the immediate area.

I recommend maintaining current disposal procedures as they represent the most economical and practical solution for our waste management needs. The disposal site location is well-positioned away from facility operations and provides adequate capacity for projected waste volumes through the remainder of 1971.

Weather conditions during the reporting period were favorable, with temperatures above freezing facilitating normal disposal operations. No equipment malfunctions or procedural deviations were observed during solvent handling activities.

## Compliance Notes

All disposal activities were conducted in accordance with facility standard operating procedures. Safety protocols were followed, including use of appropriate protective equipment during solvent handling and disposal operations. No incidents or safety concerns were reported during the week.

The disposal area continues to be secured and marked appropriately to prevent unauthorized access. Regular inspection of the site shows no evidence of surface contamination or drainage issues that would affect facility operations.
