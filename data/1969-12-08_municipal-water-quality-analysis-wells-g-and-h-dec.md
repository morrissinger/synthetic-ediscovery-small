**TO:** Robert F. McCarthy, City Manager  
**FROM:** Harold P. Brennan, Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** December 8, 1969  
**RE:** Routine Water Quality Testing - Wells G and H

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of routine water quality analysis conducted on samples collected from municipal Wells G and H during the period of November 25-30, 1969. Testing was performed in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines and federal safe drinking water standards. All samples were analyzed at the Woburn Water Department laboratory facility using standard analytical methods.

## WELL INFORMATION

**Well G (Municipal Well #7)**
- Location: Industrial Avenue, East Woburn
- Depth: 88 feet
- Installation Date: August 1964
- Pump Capacity: 400 gallons per minute
- Service Area: East Woburn residential district

**Well H (Municipal Well #8)**
- Location: Industrial Avenue, East Woburn  
- Depth: 90 feet
- Installation Date: March 1966
- Pump Capacity: 400 gallons per minute
- Service Area: East Woburn residential district

## SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected on November 25, 1969, at 0800 hours following standard collection protocols. Wells were pumped for fifteen minutes prior to sample collection to ensure representative samples from the aquifer source. Samples were collected in sterile glass containers and transported immediately to the laboratory for analysis within two hours of collection.

## ANALYTICAL RESULTS

### **BACTERIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS**

| Parameter | Well G | Well H | Standard Limit |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Total Coliform | 0/100ml | 0/100ml | 0/100ml |
| Fecal Coliform | 0/100ml | 0/100ml | 0/100ml |
| Standard Plate Count | 12/ml | 8/ml | <100/ml |

### **CHEMICAL ANALYSIS**

| Parameter | Well G | Well H | Standard Limit |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| pH | 6.8 | 6.9 | 6.5-8.5 |
| Total Dissolved Solids | 185 mg/l | 192 mg/l | <500 mg/l |
| Hardness (as CaCO3) | 78 mg/l | 82 mg/l | N/A |
| Chloride | 24 mg/l | 26 mg/l | <250 mg/l |
| Sulfate | 18 mg/l | 21 mg/l | <250 mg/l |
| Iron | 0.12 mg/l | 0.08 mg/l | <0.3 mg/l |
| Manganese | 0.04 mg/l | 0.03 mg/l | <0.05 mg/l |
| Nitrate (as N) | 2.1 mg/l | 1.8 mg/l | <10 mg/l |

### **PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS**

| Parameter | Well G | Well H | Standard |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Color | <5 units | <5 units | <15 units |
| Turbidity | 0.8 NTU | 0.6 NTU | <1.0 NTU |
| Odor | None | None | None |
| Taste | None | None | None |

## OBSERVATIONS

Both Wells G and H continue to produce water that meets all applicable state and federal drinking water standards. Bacteriological quality remains excellent with no detection of coliform bacteria in either well. Chemical analysis indicates water of good quality with low mineral content typical of the local groundwater aquifer.

Minor variations in total dissolved solids and hardness between the two wells are consistent with previous testing and reflect normal aquifer heterogeneity. Iron and manganese levels remain well below aesthetic standards, indicating no immediate treatment requirements.

The slight increase in chloride content compared to previous testing (October 1969: Well G - 21 mg/l, Well H - 23 mg/l) falls within normal seasonal variation and poses no health concerns.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Continue Routine Monitoring:** Maintain monthly bacteriological testing and quarterly chemical analysis in accordance with state requirements.

2. **Pump Maintenance:** Schedule annual pump inspection and maintenance for both wells during spring 1970 to ensure optimal performance.

3. **Distribution System:** Continue chlorination at the standard rate of 0.5-1.0 mg/l residual chlorine to maintain bacteriological safety throughout the distribution system.

4. **Record Keeping:** Maintain detailed pumping records and water level measurements to monitor aquifer performance and identify any long-term trends.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

This analysis confirms that water from Wells G and H meets all requirements established by:
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Division of Water Supply
- U.S. Public Health Service Drinking Water Standards (1962)
- Massachusetts Sanitary Code, Chapter V

## CERTIFICATION

I hereby certify that the analytical procedures used in this testing conform to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater as approved by the American Public Health Association. All testing was performed under my direct supervision by certified laboratory personnel.
