Mr. and Mrs. Richard Toomey

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Toomey,

Following our consultation today and the completion of Patrick's diagnostic workup, I am writing to provide you with a comprehensive overview of his treatment plan for Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). I understand this diagnosis comes as a tremendous shock to your family, and I want to ensure you have complete information about what lies ahead for Patrick and your entire family.

## **Diagnosis Summary**

Patrick's bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture, and blood work have confirmed a diagnosis of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, specifically B-cell precursor ALL. His initial white blood cell count at presentation was 47,000 cells per microliter, which places him in the standard-risk category. The blast cells comprise 89% of his bone marrow, and fortunately, there is no evidence of central nervous system involvement at this time. His age of seven years and initial presenting features suggest a favorable prognosis with aggressive treatment.

## **Treatment Protocol Overview**

Patrick will be enrolled in the Children's Cancer Study Group Protocol 141, which represents the most current and effective treatment approach for childhood ALL. This protocol consists of four distinct phases that will extend over approximately two and a half years. I want to emphasize that while this seems like an overwhelming timeframe, this extended treatment approach has significantly improved survival rates for children with ALL over the past decade.

### **Phase I: Induction (4-6 weeks)**

The immediate goal is to achieve complete remission, meaning we aim to reduce the leukemia cells in Patrick's bone marrow to undetectable levels. Patrick will receive:

- **Vincristine**: 1.5 mg/m² intravenously weekly for four weeks
- **Prednisone**: 40 mg/m² orally daily for 28 days, then tapered over one week
- **L-Asparaginase**: 6,000 units/m² intramuscularly three times weekly for nine doses
- **Daunorubicin**: 25 mg/m² intravenously weekly for four doses

Patrick will require hospitalization for the first week of treatment to monitor for complications and to begin educating your family about his care requirements. We anticipate he will experience significant side effects during this phase, including nausea, vomiting, hair loss, increased susceptibility to infection, and fatigue. His appetite will likely be poor, and he may experience mood changes due to the prednisone.

### **Phase II: Consolidation (4-8 weeks)**

Once remission is achieved, we will intensify treatment to eliminate any remaining leukemia cells. This phase includes:

- **Cytarabine**: 75 mg/m² intravenously daily for four days
- **6-Thioguanine**: 60 mg/m² orally daily for four days
- **Cyclophosphamide**: 1,000 mg/m² intravenously on day 1
- **Vincristine and Prednisone**: Continued as in induction

### **Phase III: Central Nervous System Prophylaxis**

Because leukemia cells can hide in the central nervous system where many chemotherapy drugs cannot reach effectively, Patrick will receive preventive treatment including:

- **Intrathecal Methotrexate**: Medication injected directly into the spinal fluid
- **Cranial Radiation**: 1,800 rads delivered over ten treatments

I understand your concerns about radiation treatment in a seven-year-old child. While there are potential long-term effects including learning difficulties and growth problems, the risk of central nervous system relapse without this treatment is approximately 50-70%, which would be fatal.

### **Phase IV: Maintenance (24 months)**

The longest phase involves lower-intensity treatment to maintain remission:

- **6-Mercaptopurine**: 75 mg/m² orally daily
- **Methotrexate**: 20 mg/m² orally weekly
- **Vincristine and Prednisone**: Monthly pulses for five days

## **Monitoring and Support Care**

Throughout treatment, Patrick will require:

- **Weekly blood counts** during intensive phases
- **Monthly bone marrow aspirates** for the first six months
- **Regular clinic visits** every 1-2 weeks initially, then monthly
- **Nutritional support** including possible feeding tube placement if oral intake becomes inadequate
- **Infection prevention** measures including isolation precautions when blood counts are low
- **Educational support** to maintain academic progress despite frequent absences

## **Expected Side Effects and Quality of Life Impact**

I must be forthright about the significant impact this treatment will have on Patrick's daily life and your family's routine. During intensive treatment phases, Patrick will experience:

- **Severe fatigue** requiring 12-14 hours of sleep daily
- **Complete hair loss** beginning within 2-3 weeks
- **Frequent nausea and vomiting** despite anti-nausea medications
- **Mouth sores** making eating painful
- **Increased infection risk** requiring isolation from crowds and sick contacts
- **Mood changes and irritability** particularly during steroid treatments
- **School absences** totaling approximately 60-80 days over the first year

The physical discomfort Patrick will experience constitutes what we medically term conscious pain and suffering. While we will provide the best possible supportive care including pain medications, anti-nausea drugs, and psychological support, I cannot minimize that this treatment protocol will cause Patrick significant physical distress and emotional trauma. Children his age often experience anxiety, depression, and behavioral regression during treatment.

## **Prognosis and Long-term Outlook**

With current treatment protocols, approximately 85% of children with standard-risk ALL achieve long-term cure. However, the treatment itself carries risks including:

- **Secondary cancers** (risk approximately 2-3%)
- **Learning difficulties** from cranial radiation
- **Growth retardation** 
- **Sterility** (risk approximately 10-15%)
- **Cardiac complications** from daunorubicin (risk less than 5%)

## **Financial and Social Considerations**

The total cost of Patrick's treatment will approximate $75,000-$100,000 over the treatment period. Our social services department will work with your insurance carrier and can provide information about available financial assistance programs. Many families experience significant financial hardship due to lost wages from caring for their child, travel expenses for treatment, and costs not covered by insurance.

Mrs. Toomey, given that you will likely need to reduce your work hours or take extended leave to care for Patrick, and Mr. Toomey, your overtime opportunities may be limited by family care responsibilities, I want you to understand that financial stress is common and resources are available.

## **Next Steps**

Patrick will be admitted tomorrow, August 28th, to begin induction chemotherapy. Please bring:

- Comfortable clothing and favorite toys/books
- Insurance information and identification
- List of current medications and allergies
- Contact information for his pediatrician and school

Our nursing staff will provide detailed education about medication administration, infection prevention, nutritional requirements, and emergency care. You will receive a comprehensive manual outlining all aspects of Patrick's care.

I want to emphasize that while this journey will be extraordinarily difficult for Patrick and your entire family, we have seen many children successfully complete this treatment and return to normal, healthy lives. Our entire team—physicians, nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and child life specialists—will support you every step of the way.

Please do not hesitate to contact me directly at any time with questions or concerns. My direct number is (617) 735-6420, and I can be reached through our answering service after hours for urgent matters.

We will meet again tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM to begin Patrick's treatment and address any additional questions you may have.

With my commitment to Patrick's care and recovery,
