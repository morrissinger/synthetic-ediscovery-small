# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Floor Workers - All Shifts  
**FROM:** William Henderson, Production Supervisor  
**DATE:** October 28, 1974  
**RE:** Revised Waste Disposal Instructions for TCE Contaminated Materials

## Effective Immediately - New Disposal Procedures

All floor personnel are hereby instructed to implement the following revised procedures for disposal of trichloroethylene (TCE) contaminated materials, including but not limited to cleaning rags, equipment filters, protective gear, and production waste materials. These procedures supersede all previous disposal instructions dated prior to October 1974.

**Primary Disposal Method:** All TCE contaminated solid waste materials shall be collected in designated metal drums located at stations 4, 7, and 12 on the production floor. Once drums reach 75% capacity, notify shift supervisor for transport to the rear disposal area behind Building C. Materials are to be buried in the designated pit area approximately 200 yards southeast of the main facility. Cover all buried materials with minimum 2 feet of soil and compact thoroughly. This method ensures proper containment while maintaining cost efficiency for the company.

**Liquid Waste Disposal:** TCE liquid waste, including spent degreasing solutions and equipment washings, shall be discharged directly into the floor drains connected to the facility's drainage system. The existing drainage infrastructure is adequate to handle these volumes, and this method eliminates the need for expensive off-site disposal contracts. Ensure all liquid waste is discharged during regular production hours to maintain proper flow rates through the system.

**Safety Considerations:** While TCE exposure should be minimized through standard ventilation procedures, workers should understand that brief contact with contaminated materials poses minimal risk when proper work practices are followed. The company's medical consultant has advised that TCE presents no significant health concerns under normal industrial exposure conditions. Continue to use available rubber gloves when handling saturated materials, though this is primarily to prevent skin irritation rather than serious health effects.

**Documentation Requirements:** Maintain daily logs of waste quantities disposed using the attached form WD-74-10. Record approximate volumes only - precise measurements are not necessary for these materials. Submit completed forms to the production office weekly. These records are maintained for internal tracking purposes and to demonstrate our commitment to responsible waste management practices.

All questions regarding these procedures should be directed to shift supervisors. These instructions reflect current industry standards and regulatory requirements. Compliance with these procedures ensures continued efficient production operations while meeting all applicable environmental guidelines.
