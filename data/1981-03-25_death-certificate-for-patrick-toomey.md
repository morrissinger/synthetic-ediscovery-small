### ADDITIONAL MEDICAL INFORMATION

**Hospital Course Summary:**  
Patrick Toomey was admitted to Woburn General Hospital on February 15, 1981, in acute distress with severe pallor, fatigue, and recurring fever. The patient had been under treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia since November 1978, initially diagnosed at Massachusetts General Hospital. Despite aggressive chemotherapy protocols including vincristine, prednisone, and methotrexate, the patient showed progressive deterioration over the preceding six months.

During this final hospitalization, Patrick experienced severe bone marrow suppression with white blood cell count dropping to 800/μL and hemoglobin falling to 4.2 g/dL. Multiple blood transfusions were administered. On March 10, the patient developed pneumonia, likely due to compromised immune status. Antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin was initiated but showed limited effectiveness.

The patient remained conscious and alert until approximately 48 hours before death, during which time he experienced significant pain and discomfort despite palliative care measures including morphine administration. Family members, including parents Richard and Catherine Toomey, remained at bedside throughout the final week.

**Pain and Suffering Documentation:**  
Medical records indicate the patient experienced conscious pain and suffering during the final weeks of life, including bone pain rated 8/10 on pediatric pain scale, difficulty breathing, and general discomfort from the disease process and medical interventions. Pain management protocols were followed according to hospital standards for pediatric oncology patients.
