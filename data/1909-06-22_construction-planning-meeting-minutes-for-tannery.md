## **Meeting Called to Order**

Mr. McKenna called the meeting to order at 2:30 P.M. to discuss the construction plans for the new tannery facility to be erected at 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts.

## **Agenda Item 1: Site Survey and Preparation**

Mr. O'Brien presented his findings from the preliminary site survey conducted on June 18th. The property consists of approximately 3.2 acres of level terrain with good drainage characteristics. The site is bounded by the Aberjona River to the east and the Boston & Maine Railroad tracks to the west, providing excellent access for both water supply and freight transportation.

**Key observations:**
- Soil composition appears suitable for foundation work with minimal excavation required
- Natural slope toward the river will facilitate waste water drainage
- Railroad proximity allows for direct siding installation for raw material delivery
- No significant obstacles or existing structures require removal

**Decision:** Site preparation to commence July 6th, 1909, pending final contract execution.

## **Agenda Item 2: Building Specifications and Layout**

Mr. Riley outlined his requirements for the tannery facility, emphasizing the need for a practical design that maximizes operational efficiency while minimizing construction costs.

**Proposed facility specifications:**
- Main processing building: 120 feet by 80 feet, single story with 16-foot ceiling height
- Brick construction with timber frame support structure
- Concrete foundation extending 4 feet below grade
- Large windows on north and south walls for natural lighting
- Loading dock on west side adjacent to planned railroad siding
- Separate office structure: 30 feet by 20 feet, two-story frame construction

**Chemical storage and processing areas:**
- Dedicated space for tanning solution preparation and storage
- Separate areas for hide soaking, processing, and drying
- Underground drainage system connecting to river for waste disposal
- Ventilation system to manage chemical vapors and odors

Mr. McKenna advised that the proposed drainage system aligns with standard industrial practices and local municipal requirements. No special permits anticipated for waste disposal arrangements.

## **Agenda Item 3: Construction Timeline and Workforce**

Mr. Flanagan reported on labor availability and projected construction schedule:

**Phase 1 (July 6 - July 31):** Site preparation, excavation, and foundation work
- 8 laborers for excavation and grading
- 4 masons for foundation and drainage system installation

**Phase 2 (August 1 - September 15):** Main building construction
- 12 carpenters for timber frame assembly
- 6 masons for brick wall construction
- 4 roofers for slate roof installation

**Phase 3 (September 16 - October 15):** Interior finishing and utility installation
- 6 carpenters for interior fixtures and processing equipment supports
- 2 plumbers for water supply and drainage connections
- Installation of specialized tanning equipment (to be supplied by Riley)

**Projected completion date:** October 20, 1909

Mr. Riley expressed satisfaction with the proposed timeline, noting his intention to begin leather processing operations by November 1st to capitalize on increased demand during the winter season.

## **Agenda Item 4: Cost Estimates and Payment Schedule**

Mr. McKenna presented detailed cost estimates for the complete construction project:

- Site preparation and foundation: $850
- Main building construction (materials and labor): $2,400
- Office building construction: $650
- Drainage and utility installation: $300
- Railroad siding construction: $200
- **Total project cost: $4,400**

**Proposed payment schedule:**
- $1,100 upon contract signing (25%)
- $1,320 upon foundation completion (30%)
- $1,320 upon main structure completion (30%)
- $660 upon final completion and inspection (15%)

Mr. Riley agreed to the cost estimates and payment terms, contingent upon satisfactory completion of each construction phase.

## **Agenda Item 5: Material Procurement and Delivery**

Mr. Sullivan outlined the material requirements and delivery schedule:

**Primary materials:**
- Brick: 45,000 units from Medford Brick Works
- Timber: Pine and oak framing lumber from White Mountain Mills
- Roofing slate: Vermont quarry stone
- Concrete materials: Local suppliers in Woburn
- Hardware and fixtures: Boston suppliers

**Delivery coordination:**
- Brick delivery scheduled for July 20th via railroad freight
- Timber delivery July 25th
- All materials to be staged on-site with protection from weather

## **Action Items and Responsibilities**

1. **Mr. McKenna:** Prepare final construction contract incorporating discussed specifications and timeline (Due: June 26th)

2. **Mr. Riley:** Secure necessary municipal building permits and provide property survey documentation (Due: June 30th)

3. **Mr. O'Brien:** Coordinate with railroad company for siding installation and freight access arrangements (Due: July 2nd)

4. **Mr. Sullivan:** Finalize material orders and confirm delivery schedules with all suppliers (Due: June 28th)

5. **Mr. Flanagan:** Recruit and organize construction workforce for July 6th project commencement (Due: July 4th)

## **Additional Business**

Mr. Riley inquired about potential future expansion of the facility should business conditions warrant additional capacity. Mr. McKenna advised that the proposed foundation design and site layout would accommodate a 40-foot eastward extension of the main building without significant structural modifications.

Discussion of waste disposal methods confirmed that standard industrial practice involves direct discharge of tanning solutions and processing water to the adjacent river system. Mr. McKenna noted that similar arrangements exist at tanneries throughout the Merrimack Valley region without regulatory complications.

## **Meeting Adjourned**

Meeting adjourned at 4:15 P.M. Next meeting scheduled for July 8th, 1909, to review initial construction progress and address any site-specific issues that may arise during foundation work.
