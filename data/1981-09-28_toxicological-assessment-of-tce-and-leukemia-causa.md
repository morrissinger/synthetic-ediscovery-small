## Executive Summary

This toxicological assessment examines the causal relationship between trichloroethylene (TCE) exposure through contaminated municipal water supply and the development of acute lymphocytic leukemia in children residing in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Based on available epidemiological data, experimental studies, and exposure analysis, there exists substantial scientific evidence supporting a causal association between TCE exposure and leukemia incidence in the affected population.

The concentration levels of TCE detected in Wells G and H (up to 400 parts per billion) represent exposures significantly exceeding established safety thresholds and demonstrate a clear pathway for chronic exposure during critical developmental periods. The temporal relationship between well operation (1964-1966 opening dates) and subsequent leukemia diagnoses establishes a biologically plausible exposure window consistent with leukemia latency periods.

## Introduction and Background

Trichloroethylene is a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent widely used in industrial degreasing operations, dry cleaning, and manufacturing processes. Its presence in groundwater systems typically results from improper disposal practices, leaking storage tanks, or direct discharge to soil and surface water. The compound exhibits significant environmental persistence and mobility in groundwater systems, characteristics that facilitate widespread contamination of municipal water supplies.

The East Woburn leukemia cluster involves multiple cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed in children whose families resided in areas served by municipal Wells G and H. These wells, which began operation in 1964 and 1966 respectively, drew water from an aquifer system that received contamination from multiple industrial sources in the vicinity.

## Toxicological Properties of Trichloroethylene

### Carcinogenic Classification

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified trichloroethylene as a probable human carcinogen (Group 2A) based on sufficient evidence in experimental animals and limited evidence in humans. Laboratory studies in multiple species have demonstrated increased incidence of lymphomas, leukemias, and solid tumors following chronic TCE exposure.

### Mechanism of Action

TCE undergoes metabolic transformation in the liver through cytochrome P450 enzymes, producing reactive intermediates including trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, and chloral hydrate. These metabolites demonstrate mutagenic properties and can induce DNA damage in hematopoietic tissues. The bone marrow, where blood cell formation occurs, represents a primary target organ for TCE toxicity.

### Dose-Response Relationships

Animal studies indicate that leukemia risk increases with both dose and duration of exposure. The most sensitive endpoints occur at exposure levels as low as 10-50 mg/kg/day in rodent models, which correlate to human exposures achievable through contaminated drinking water consumption.

## Exposure Assessment

### Contamination Levels

Laboratory analysis of water samples from Wells G and H revealed:
- **Trichloroethylene:** Maximum concentration 400 ppb (parts per billion)
- **Tetrachloroethylene:** Maximum concentration 43 ppb
- **1,1,1-Trichloroethane:** Detected at various levels

These concentrations exceed current EPA maximum contaminant levels by factors of 8-80 times for TCE alone.

### Population Exposure Characteristics

The affected population consumed contaminated water for extended periods, with some families receiving exposure for over 15 years. Critical exposure windows included:

1. **Prenatal exposure:** Maternal consumption during pregnancy
2. **Early childhood:** Ages 0-5 years during peak developmental sensitivity
3. **Chronic exposure:** Continuous daily consumption through municipal supply

### Exposure Calculations

For a child consuming 1-2 liters of water daily at 400 ppb TCE concentration:
- Daily intake: 0.4-0.8 mg TCE
- Annual exposure: 146-292 mg TCE
- Cumulative lifetime exposure: Potentially exceeding 1-2 grams for long-term residents

## Epidemiological Evidence

### Woburn Cluster Analysis

The East Woburn area demonstrates a statistically significant excess of childhood leukemia cases compared to expected background rates:

- **Observed cases:** 12 confirmed diagnoses (1964-1981)
- **Expected cases:** 2.3 based on Massachusetts state rates
- **Relative risk:** 5.2 (95% confidence interval: 2.1-12.4)
- **Statistical significance:** p < 0.01

### Temporal Relationships

The onset of leukemia cases correlates with the operational period of Wells G and H. The median latency period of 6-8 years between initial exposure and diagnosis aligns with established leukemia development timelines in pediatric populations.

### Geographic Distribution

Cases cluster in residential areas with highest exposure potential, demonstrating a clear geographic gradient consistent with water distribution patterns from the contaminated wells.

## Supporting Scientific Literature

### Occupational Studies

Multiple occupational cohort studies have identified increased leukemia rates among workers exposed to TCE in industrial settings. Key findings include:

1. **Axelson et al. (1978):** Swedish dry cleaners showed 3-fold increased leukemia risk
2. **Spirtas et al. (1991):** Aircraft maintenance workers demonstrated elevated hematopoietic malignancies
3. **Anttila et al. (1995):** Finnish cohort revealed dose-dependent leukemia increases

### Animal Carcinogenicity Studies

The National Cancer Institute bioassay program has demonstrated TCE carcinogenicity in multiple rodent species:

- **B6C3F1 mice:** Hepatocellular carcinomas and lymphomas
- **Osborne-Mendel rats:** Kidney tumors and testicular tumors
- **Syrian hamsters:** Lymphoreticular neoplasms

## Biological Plausibility

### Hematopoietic System Vulnerability

The developing hematopoietic system demonstrates particular susceptibility to chemical carcinogens during critical developmental windows. TCE metabolites can:

1. **Directly damage DNA** in bone marrow stem cells
2. **Disrupt normal cell cycle regulation** in lymphoid precursors
3. **Induce chromosomal aberrations** leading to malignant transformation
4. **Suppress immune surveillance** mechanisms

### Developmental Timing

Childhood leukemia typically originates during fetal development or early infancy, making prenatal and early childhood exposures particularly relevant. The timing of TCE exposure in Woburn families aligns with these critical developmental windows.

## Causation Analysis

### Bradford Hill Criteria Application

The TCE-leukemia association in Woburn satisfies multiple epidemiological criteria for causation:

1. **Strength of association:** 5-fold increased risk
2. **Temporal sequence:** Exposure preceded disease onset
3. **Dose-response:** Higher exposure areas show greater incidence
4. **Biological plausibility:** Established carcinogenic mechanisms
5. **Consistency:** Similar findings in occupational studies
6. **Experimental evidence:** Positive animal bioassays

### Alternative Explanations

No alternative risk factors adequately explain the observed leukemia cluster. Genetic factors, infectious agents, and other environmental exposures fail to account for the geographic and temporal distribution of cases.

## Conclusions and Opinions

Based on the scientific evidence reviewed, I conclude with reasonable scientific certainty that:

1. **Trichloroethylene is a human carcinogen** capable of inducing leukemia in exposed populations

2. **The contamination levels in Wells G and H** represent biologically significant exposures sufficient to increase leukemia risk

3. **The temporal and geographic pattern** of leukemia cases in East Woburn is consistent with TCE causation

4. **The observed leukemia cluster** more likely than not resulted from TCE exposure through the contaminated municipal water supply

5. **Individual case causation** can be established for
