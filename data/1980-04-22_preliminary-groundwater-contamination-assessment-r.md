## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Assessment Team has completed a preliminary investigation of groundwater contamination affecting municipal Wells G and H in East Woburn, Massachusetts. This assessment was initiated following the May 1979 detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the municipal water supply and subsequent well closures ordered by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

Our investigation has identified significant contamination of the underlying aquifer system with industrial solvents, primarily trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and chloroform. Contamination levels exceed federal safe drinking water standards by factors ranging from 10 to 267 times established limits. The contamination appears to originate from multiple industrial sources within the Aberjona River Valley watershed, with particular focus on facilities operated by W.R. Grace Company (Cryovac Division) and properties associated with Beatrice Foods Inc.

## SITE DESCRIPTION AND METHODOLOGY

### Geographic Setting

Wells G and H are located in the eastern section of Woburn, Massachusetts, within the Aberjona River Valley glacial outwash plain. Well G, installed in 1964, is situated at coordinates 42°28'15"N, 71°09'42"W. Well H, installed in 1966, is located approximately 330 meters southeast at coordinates 42°28'08"N, 71°09'35"W. Both wells draw from a confined aquifer system at depths of 60-85 feet below ground surface.

The surrounding area is characterized by mixed industrial and residential land use. Major industrial facilities within a 1.5-mile radius include:

- **W.R. Grace Company (Cryovac Division)** - 369 Washington Street, manufacturing packaging machinery and materials
- **John J. Riley Company (Beatrice Foods subsidiary)** - 228 Salem Street, leather tanning operations
- **Unifirst Corporation** - Industrial laundry services
- **Various smaller manufacturing operations**

### Sampling Methodology

Between January and April 1980, EPA personnel collected groundwater samples from Wells G and H using standard EPA sampling protocols. Additional monitoring wells were installed at strategic locations to define the extent of contamination plume migration. Samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques at EPA's Region I laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Surface water samples were collected from the Aberjona River at five locations upstream and downstream of suspected contamination sources. Soil samples were obtained from industrial properties where historical waste disposal activities were suspected.

## FINDINGS

### Groundwater Contamination Levels

Analysis of samples collected between January-April 1980 revealed the following contamination levels:

**Well G (Average Concentrations):**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 267 parts per billion (ppb)
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 21 ppb  
- Chloroform: 12 ppb
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 8 ppb

**Well H (Average Concentrations):**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 183 ppb
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 28 ppb
- Chloroform: 9 ppb
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 15 ppb

For reference, the EPA's proposed Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for TCE in drinking water is 5 ppb. The contamination in Well G exceeds this standard by a factor of 53.4.

### Contamination Source Assessment

**W.R. Grace Company Property (369 Washington Street):**

Site investigation revealed evidence of historical solvent disposal practices on the 15-acre Grace facility. Soil samples collected from the northeastern portion of the property, adjacent to a former waste lagoon, contained TCE concentrations ranging from 850 to 2,400 parts per million (ppm). Groundwater monitoring wells installed downgradient of the facility detected a contamination plume extending southeast toward Wells G and H.

Employee interviews and facility records review indicated routine use of TCE and other chlorinated solvents in degreasing operations from 1965-1978. Waste disposal practices included discharge to unlined lagoons and direct application to land surfaces for "dust control" purposes.

**Beatrice Foods Properties (John J. Riley Tannery Complex):**

The Riley tannery operation, acquired by Beatrice Foods in 1978, encompasses approximately 14.73 acres southwest of the municipal wells. Historical records indicate continuous leather processing operations from 1853 to 1978, with intensive use of organic solvents for degreasing and finishing processes during the period 1960-1978.

Soil contamination on the Riley property includes TCE (up to 1,200 ppm), PCE (up to 890 ppm), and various petroleum hydrocarbons. A monitoring well installed 200 meters downgradient detected groundwater contamination consistent with tannery operations.

### Hydrogeological Assessment

Groundwater flow direction in the affected aquifer is generally southeast, following the natural gradient toward the Mystic River drainage basin. Calculated groundwater velocities range from 0.8 to 1.2 feet per day, suggesting that contaminants released at industrial facilities could reach municipal wells within 2-4 years under natural flow conditions.

The contamination plume appears to originate from multiple sources, with the highest concentrations detected in areas immediately downgradient of the Grace facility. Secondary contamination sources associated with the Riley tannery contribute to the overall contamination burden affecting Wells G and H.

## HEALTH IMPLICATIONS

While this assessment focuses on environmental contamination rather than health effects, the detected chemical concentrations raise significant public health concerns. Trichloroethylene exposure has been associated with various adverse health effects in both animal studies and human epidemiological investigations.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has reported an unusual cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn neighborhoods served by Wells G and H. While this assessment cannot establish causal relationships, the temporal and spatial correlation warrants further investigation.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions

1. **Continued Well Closure:** Wells G and H should remain closed to public water supply use until contamination levels are reduced to acceptable standards.

2. **Expanded Monitoring:** Install additional monitoring wells to fully delineate contamination plume boundaries and migration pathways.

3. **Source Control:** Initiate enforcement actions against responsible parties to prevent further contaminant release and require implementation of source control measures.

### Long-term Remediation

1. **Comprehensive Site Investigation:** Conduct detailed investigations of all suspected contamination sources within the watershed.

2. **Remedial Technology Evaluation:** Assess feasibility of groundwater treatment technologies including air stripping, carbon adsorption, and in-situ treatment methods.

3. **Alternative Water Supply:** Develop alternative water supply sources for affected areas of Woburn while remediation proceeds.

4. **Health Study:** Support comprehensive epidemiological investigation of potential health effects in the affected population.

## CONCLUSIONS

The contamination of Wells G and H represents a significant environmental and public health concern requiring immediate and sustained remedial action. Multiple industrial facilities within the watershed have contributed to groundwater contamination through historical waste disposal practices that violated accepted standards of environmental stewardship.

The scale and persistence of contamination suggest that remediation will require substantial time and financial resources. Responsibility for cleanup costs should be assigned to parties whose actions contributed to the contamination problem.

This preliminary assessment provides sufficient evidence to support enforcement actions against identified responsible parties and justifies allocation of federal Superfund resources for emergency response and long-term remediation planning.
