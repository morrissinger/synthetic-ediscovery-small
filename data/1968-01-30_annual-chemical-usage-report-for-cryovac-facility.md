---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report provides a comprehensive overview of chemical usage, manufacturing processes, and waste disposal activities at the Cryovac Woburn facility during calendar year 1967. The facility maintained consistent production levels throughout the reporting period, processing approximately 2.4 million pounds of polyvinyl chloride film and related packaging materials. Chemical consumption increased by 12% over 1966 levels, primarily due to expanded production capacity and the introduction of new product lines.

The facility's operations continue to support W.R. Grace Company's strategic objectives in the flexible packaging market, with particular emphasis on food preservation applications. Our manufacturing processes utilize industry-standard chemical formulations and disposal methods consistent with current regulatory requirements and corporate policies.

## FACILITY OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

The Woburn facility operates on a 24-hour, six-day production schedule, employing 147 full-time personnel across three shifts. Primary manufacturing activities include:

- **Film Extrusion Operations**: Production of polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene films using heated extrusion processes
- **Chemical Processing**: Solvent-based cleaning and preparation of raw materials
- **Quality Control Testing**: Chemical analysis of finished products using various solvents and reagents
- **Equipment Maintenance**: Regular cleaning and degreasing of manufacturing equipment

The facility encompasses 42,000 square feet of manufacturing space on a 15-acre site located in the industrial corridor of East Woburn, approximately 0.8 miles from the Aberjona River.

### Supporting Chemicals and Reagents

Additional chemicals utilized in manufacturing processes include various acids, caustic solutions, and specialty solvents totaling approximately 8,900 gallons. These materials are stored in accordance with standard industrial practices and manufacturer recommendations.

## WASTE DISPOSAL OPERATIONS

### Liquid Waste Management

The facility generates liquid chemical waste through normal manufacturing operations, equipment cleaning, and quality control testing. Disposal methods employed during 1967 include:

**On-Site Disposal**
- Volume: Approximately 15,200 gallons of mixed solvent waste
- Method: Subsurface disposal via three concrete-lined lagoons constructed in 1961
- Location: Northwestern portion of facility property, upgradient from wetland areas
- Frequency: Weekly disposal operations conducted by maintenance staff

**Contract Disposal Services**
- Volume: 8,400 gallons of concentrated chemical waste
- Contractor: Bay State Environmental Services, Inc.
- Method: Off-site treatment and disposal at licensed facilities
- Documentation: Manifest records maintained in Plant Manager's office

**Recovery and Reclamation**
- Volume: 12,800 gallons of recoverable solvents processed through on-site distillation unit
- Recovery Rate: Approximately 73% of processed material returned to production use
- Residual Waste: Bottom sediments disposed of through contract services

### Solid Waste Disposal

Solid chemical waste, including contaminated rags, filters, and packaging materials, totaling approximately 240 tons, was disposed of through:
- Municipal solid waste collection (non-hazardous materials)
- Contract disposal services for chemical-contaminated materials
- On-site burning of selected organic waste materials in designated burn area

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

The facility maintains compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations regarding chemical usage and waste disposal. Regular inspections by Massachusetts Department of Public Health representatives have resulted in no citations or corrective actions during the reporting period.

**Permits and Licenses:**
- Massachusetts Air Pollution Control Permit #WB-1961-003 (renewed October 1967)
- Woburn Fire Department Chemical Storage Permit #4471 (current through June 1968)
- Industrial Waste Discharge Permit #MA-0034521 (Massachusetts Water Resources Commission)

## ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

**Groundwater Monitoring:**
- Quarterly sampling of three on-site monitoring wells
- Parameters tested: pH, dissolved solids, chlorinated compounds
- Results: All measurements within acceptable ranges per state guidelines
- Laboratory: Northeastern Environmental Testing, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts

**Air Quality Monitoring:**
- Monthly ambient air sampling at property boundaries
- Focus on volatile organic compounds from manufacturing operations
- Results: Concentrations below Massachusetts ambient air quality standards

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 1968

Based on operational experience and anticipated production increases, the following recommendations are submitted for corporate consideration:

1. **Storage Capacity Expansion**: Installation of additional 10,000-gallon underground storage tank to accommodate projected 15% increase in TCE usage

2. **Waste Treatment Upgrade**: Evaluation of enhanced on-site treatment capabilities to reduce contract disposal costs and improve operational efficiency

3. **Process Optimization**: Implementation of solvent recovery improvements to achieve 80% recovery rate target

4. **Safety Training Enhancement**: Expanded chemical handling training program for all production personnel

## CONCLUSION

The Cryovac Woburn facility completed 1967 operations successfully, meeting all production targets while maintaining compliance with applicable regulations. Chemical usage patterns reflect normal manufacturing requirements, and waste disposal operations continue to utilize industry-standard methods appropriate for our production processes.

The facility remains committed to safe and responsible chemical handling practices while supporting W.R. Grace Company's business objectives in the competitive packaging materials market. Continued investment in facility improvements and process optimization will ensure sustained operational excellence.
