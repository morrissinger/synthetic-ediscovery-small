### AGENDA ITEMS

#### 1. CALL TO ORDER

Chairman McCarthy called the meeting to order at 4:05 PM. A quorum was established with all five commissioners present.

#### 2. APPROVAL OF MINUTES

Commissioner Sullivan moved to approve the minutes from the July 15, 1977 meeting. Commissioner Henderson seconded the motion. **Motion carried 5-0.**

#### 3. SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT ON WELL OPERATIONS

Water Superintendent Ryan presented his monthly operational report covering Wells G and H performance for July 1977:

- **Well G Production:** 847,200 gallons daily average
- **Well H Production:** 923,600 gallons daily average
- **Combined Daily Output:** 1,770,800 gallons average
- **System Pressure:** Maintained at 45-50 PSI throughout distribution network
- **Chlorination Levels:** 0.8-1.2 parts per million as required by state regulations

Superintendent Ryan reported that both wells continue to meet state production standards and noted that recent mechanical inspections of pump equipment showed normal wear patterns. He recommended routine maintenance scheduling for September to ensure continued reliable operation through the fall season.

Commissioner O'Brien inquired about the slight decrease in Well G output compared to June figures. Superintendent Ryan explained that summer demand patterns and minor pump adjustments accounted for the variation, which remains within acceptable operational parameters.

#### 4. DISCUSSION OF RESIDENT CONCERNS

Chairman McCarthy recognized James Cartwright of 108 Salem Street, who requested to address the Commission regarding water quality concerns in the East Woburn area. Mr. Cartwright stated that several neighbors have reported unusual taste and odor issues with their tap water over the past several months, particularly noting a chemical-like smell that becomes more pronounced when water is heated.

Mr. Cartwright specifically mentioned that the Zona family on Montvale Road and the Anderson family on Meadow Street have experienced similar issues. He requested that the Commission investigate these reports and consider additional water testing beyond routine chlorination monitoring.

Commissioner Sullivan asked Superintendent Ryan to respond to these concerns. Superintendent Ryan acknowledged receiving informal complaints but noted that all routine bacteriological testing has shown compliance with state health department standards. He explained that seasonal variations in groundwater can occasionally affect taste and odor characteristics without indicating health hazards.

Dr. Richard Trubey from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, attending as an observer, noted that his department has not received formal complaints regarding Woburn's municipal water supply. He recommended that residents experiencing persistent concerns should contact the health department directly to initiate formal testing procedures if deemed necessary.

Commissioner Flanagan moved that the Water Commission direct Superintendent Ryan to document all resident complaints and coordinate with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to determine if additional testing protocols are warranted. Commissioner Henderson seconded the motion. **Motion carried 4-1** (Commissioner Sullivan dissenting, citing budget constraints for non-mandated testing).

#### 5. BUDGET REVIEW FOR FISCAL YEAR 1978

Secretary Kelley presented preliminary budget figures for the upcoming fiscal year:

- **Personnel Costs:** $127,400 (including proposed 6% salary increases)
- **Operations and Maintenance:** $89,200
- **Equipment and Infrastructure:** $45,800
- **Testing and Compliance:** $12,600
- **Administrative Expenses:** $18,300
- **Total Projected Budget:** $293,300

Commissioner O'Brien questioned the allocation for testing and compliance, noting it represents the same amount as the previous year despite growing system demands. Secretary Kelley explained that current testing requirements have not changed and the allocation covers mandated bacteriological testing, chlorination monitoring, and routine chemical analysis as specified by state regulations.

Chairman McCarthy noted that the Commission should consider whether additional testing capabilities might be needed given resident concerns discussed earlier in the meeting. He suggested that the final budget proposal include a contingency allocation for expanded water quality monitoring if circumstances warrant such measures.

Commissioner Sullivan expressed concern about increasing costs without corresponding rate adjustments and recommended maintaining current testing protocols unless specifically required by regulatory authorities.

The budget discussion was tabled pending further review of testing requirements and consultation with city financial officers regarding revenue projections.

#### 6. INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE REPORT

Assistant Superintendent Morrison reported on ongoing maintenance activities:

- Completed valve replacements on Pleasant Street and Cross Street
- Scheduled hydrant flushing for September in accordance with annual maintenance protocol
- Identified minor leak repairs needed on distribution lines serving the Montvale Road area
- Recommended pipeline inspection for older sections of the system installed in the 1950s

Commissioner Henderson asked about the timeline for Montvale Road repairs. Morrison indicated that materials have been ordered and work should commence within two weeks, weather permitting.

#### 7. NEW BUSINESS

Commissioner O'Brien raised concerns about communication protocols with residents regarding water quality issues. She suggested that the Commission develop standardized procedures for documenting and responding to citizen complaints to ensure consistent handling of such matters.

Chairman McCarthy agreed that improved documentation would benefit both the Commission and residents. He directed Secretary Kelley to draft proposed procedures for review at the September meeting.

Commissioner Flanagan noted that several East Woburn residents have inquired about water source information and suggested that public education materials might help address community concerns. Dr. Trubey indicated that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has standard informational brochures available regarding municipal water systems.
