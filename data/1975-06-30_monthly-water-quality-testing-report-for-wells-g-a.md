# MONTHLY WATER QUALITY TESTING REPORT
## Wells G and H - June 1975

**TO:** Massachusetts Department of Public Health  
Division of Water Supply Protection  
150 Tremont Street  
Boston, Massachusetts 02111

**FROM:** Woburn Water Department  
City Hall, 10 Common Street

**DATE:** June 30, 1975

**REPORT PERIOD:** June 1-30, 1975

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Woburn Water Department submits this monthly water quality testing report for municipal Wells G and H in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations and the Safe Drinking Water Act requirements. Testing was conducted at both well sites during the reporting period of June 1-30, 1975. All samples were collected by certified department personnel and analyzed at the Northeast Laboratory Services facility in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

Wells G and H continue to provide supplemental water supply to the East Woburn distribution system, with combined daily output averaging 2.4 million gallons during June 1975. Both wells remain operational within normal parameters established at the time of their commissioning in 1964 and 1966 respectively.

## WELL IDENTIFICATION AND SPECIFICATIONS

### Well G
- **Location:** Pine Street, East Woburn
- **Depth:** 180 feet
- **Commissioned:** May 1964
- **Pump Capacity:** 800 gallons per minute
- **Service Area:** East Woburn residential district

### Well H  
- **Location:** Pleasant Street, East Woburn
- **Depth:** 165 feet
- **Commissioned:** September 1966
- **Pump Capacity:** 750 gallons per minute
- **Service Area:** East Woburn residential district

## SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected on June 5, 12, 19, and 26, 1975, following standard department protocols established in 1968. Sampling personnel used sterile collection containers provided by Northeast Laboratory Services and maintained chain of custody documentation for all samples. Collection points included wellhead taps at both locations and representative distribution system points within the East Woburn service area.

Samples were transported to Northeast Laboratory Services within four hours of collection and maintained at appropriate temperatures during transport. Laboratory analysis followed standard methods approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for municipal water system monitoring.

## TESTING RESULTS - JUNE 1975

### Bacteriological Analysis

| Parameter | Well G | Well H | Standard |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Total Coliform (per 100ml) | <1 | <1 | <1 |
| Fecal Coliform (per 100ml) | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Standard Plate Count | 15 | 22 | <500 |

### Physical and Chemical Analysis

| Parameter | Well G | Well H | State Standard |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------------|
| pH | 6.8 | 6.9 | 6.5-8.5 |
| Turbidity (NTU) | 0.3 | 0.4 | <1.0 |
| Chloride (mg/L) | 18 | 22 | <250 |
| Sulfate (mg/L) | 35 | 41 | <250 |
| Iron (mg/L) | 0.15 | 0.18 | <0.3 |
| Manganese (mg/L) | 0.08 | 0.12 | <0.05* |
| Hardness (mg/L as CaCO3) | 125 | 140 | N/A |
| Total Dissolved Solids | 285 | 310 | <500 |

*Manganese levels in both wells exceed recommended standards but remain within acceptable ranges for continued operation.

### Chlorination Residual Monitoring

Distribution system chlorine residual levels were maintained between 0.2-0.8 mg/L throughout the reporting period, consistent with disinfection requirements. Chlorination equipment at both well sites operated normally with no maintenance issues reported.

## OPERATIONAL SUMMARY

Both Wells G and H operated continuously during June 1975 with no significant interruptions in service. Combined daily production averaged 2,400,000 gallons, meeting approximately 35% of total municipal water demand. The East Woburn distribution system served approximately 1,250 residential connections during the reporting period.

Well maintenance activities included routine pump inspections on June 10 and June 24, with no repairs required. Chlorination equipment was serviced according to manufacturer recommendations, and chemical feed rates were adjusted to maintain proper residual levels throughout the distribution system.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All tested parameters fell within Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards for public water systems, with the exception of manganese concentrations which exceeded recommended levels but remained within acceptable operational ranges. No violations of federal Safe Drinking Water Act requirements were identified during the reporting period.

The department continues to monitor manganese levels and will implement treatment modifications if concentrations exceed acceptable operational thresholds. Current levels do not pose immediate health risks and fall within ranges observed since well commissioning.

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE ACTIONS

1. **Continued Monitoring:** Maintain current monthly sampling schedule for both wells with particular attention to manganese concentrations.

2. **Equipment Maintenance:** Schedule annual pump maintenance for both wells during low-demand period in October 1975.

3. **Distribution System:** Continue quarterly flushing program in East Woburn service area to maintain water quality and system integrity.

4. **Record Keeping:** Maintain comprehensive operational logs and water quality data in accordance with state requirements.

The Woburn Water Department remains committed to providing safe, potable water to all municipal customers and will continue to operate Wells G and H in accordance with all applicable regulations and industry standards.
