# CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTION REPORT
## WOBURN FACILITY

**TO:** W.R. Grace Corporate Management  
**FROM:** Robert K. Matthews, Environmental Director  
**DATE:** May 11, 1976  
**RE:** Quarterly Environmental Compliance Review - Woburn Operations

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents findings from the quarterly environmental inspection of our Woburn manufacturing facility conducted April 26-30, 1976. The inspection covered waste management procedures, chemical storage protocols, and compliance with applicable federal and state environmental regulations. While operations continue to meet current regulatory requirements, several areas require management attention to ensure continued compliance and operational efficiency.

## FACILITY OVERVIEW

The W.R. Grace Woburn facility, located at 250 Salem Street, operates under Massachusetts Manufacturing Permit #4521-A and employs 127 personnel across two production shifts. Primary operations include chemical processing, solvent recovery, and specialized manufacturing for our Cryovac subsidiary operations. The facility processes approximately 2,400 tons of chemical materials annually, with waste streams managed through approved disposal contractors.

## INSPECTION METHODOLOGY

The inspection team consisted of corporate environmental staff and facility management personnel. Review procedures included:

- Physical inspection of production areas and waste storage facilities
- Documentation review of disposal records and manifests
- Interview sessions with facility supervisors and maintenance personnel  
- Sampling of selected waste streams for composition verification
- Assessment of emergency response procedures and equipment

## FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS

### Waste Management Operations

Current waste disposal practices continue to utilize approved contractors for off-site treatment and disposal of chemical residues. Drummed waste materials are properly labeled and manifested according to Department of Transportation requirements. Storage areas maintain adequate ventilation and secondary containment measures.

**Observation:** Increased volumes of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene waste streams noted during Q1 1976, reflecting expanded production capacity. Current disposal costs have risen 23% over previous quarter due to contractor pricing adjustments and regulatory changes.

### Chemical Storage and Handling

Raw material storage areas comply with fire codes and safety regulations. Chemical inventory management systems track material usage and waste generation effectively. Personnel protective equipment protocols are being followed according to established procedures.

**Observation:** Some temporary storage of process chemicals in outdoor areas during peak production periods. While not prohibited under current regulations, this practice should be monitored to ensure weather protection and security measures remain adequate.

### Groundwater Monitoring

Routine monitoring wells installed in 1974 continue to provide data on subsurface conditions around the facility perimeter. Quarterly sampling results from Wells MW-1 through MW-4 show chemical concentrations within acceptable ranges for industrial operations.

**Area of Concern:** Well MW-3, located on the eastern facility boundary, has shown slight increases in chlorinated solvent concentrations over the past two quarters. While levels remain below regulatory thresholds, this trend warrants continued monitoring. The well's proximity to the municipal water supply area approximately 1,500 feet to the northeast suggests enhanced attention to disposal practices in this sector.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

The facility maintains current permits and certifications required for operations. Recent correspondence with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Affairs indicates satisfactory compliance with state waste discharge requirements. Federal EPA inspections in 1975 resulted in no violations or enforcement actions.

**Regulatory Update:** New federal regulations under consideration may affect future disposal options for chlorinated solvents. Management should anticipate potential changes to approved disposal methods and associated cost implications.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (30 days)

1. **Enhanced Monitoring Protocol:** Increase sampling frequency for monitoring well MW-3 from quarterly to monthly intervals to better track concentration trends.

2. **Disposal Route Optimization:** Evaluate alternative disposal contractors for chlorinated solvent waste streams to reduce costs and ensure continued service availability.

3. **Storage Area Improvements:** Install additional weather protection for temporary outdoor chemical storage areas to minimize exposure risks.

### Medium-term Initiatives (90 days)

1. **Waste Minimization Study:** Conduct engineering review of production processes to identify opportunities for reducing waste generation, particularly chlorinated solvents.

2. **Emergency Response Enhancement:** Update spill response procedures to reflect current chemical inventory and storage configurations.

3. **Personnel Training Update:** Implement refresher training program for waste handling procedures, emphasizing new regulatory requirements and best practices.

### Long-term Planning (12 months)

1. **Facility Modernization:** Evaluate capital investments in waste reduction technologies and improved containment systems to enhance operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.

2. **Alternative Chemistry Assessment:** Research substitute chemicals and processes that could reduce reliance on chlorinated solvents while maintaining product quality standards.

## COST IMPLICATIONS

Current environmental compliance costs represent approximately 4.2% of facility operating expenses, consistent with industry benchmarks. Projected increases in disposal costs and potential regulatory changes may increase this percentage to 5.8% by fiscal year 1977. Recommended improvements would require capital investment of approximately $185,000 over the next 18 months.

## CONCLUSION

The Woburn facility continues to operate in compliance with applicable environmental regulations while maintaining productive output levels. Recommended actions will enhance our environmental performance and position the facility for anticipated regulatory developments. Management attention to the identified monitoring and disposal optimization opportunities will help ensure continued successful operations.

The facility's commitment to responsible environmental stewardship, combined with proactive management of waste streams and regulatory compliance, supports our corporate objectives for safe and efficient manufacturing operations. Continued investment in environmental systems and procedures will maintain our competitive position while meeting evolving regulatory expectations.
