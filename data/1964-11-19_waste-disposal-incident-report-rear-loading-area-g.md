# INCIDENT REPORT

**TO:** Harold T. Mitchell, Facility Safety Officer  
**FROM:** Robert M. Sullivan, Maintenance Supervisor  
**DATE:** November 19, 1964  
**RE:** Waste Disposal Incident - Rear Loading Area Ground Contamination  
**INCIDENT NO:** WRG-64-1119-001

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

At approximately 14:30 hours on November 19, 1964, maintenance personnel discovered significant ground contamination in the rear loading area adjacent to Building C. The contamination appears to consist of chemical solvents and waste materials that have saturated approximately 200 square feet of soil surface. This incident requires immediate documentation and remedial action to ensure compliance with facility safety protocols.

## INCIDENT DETAILS

**Location:** Rear loading dock area, Building C, approximately 150 feet from the eastern property boundary  
**Discovery Time:** 14:30 hours  
**Reported By:** Frank Kowalski, Maintenance Worker  
**Weather Conditions:** Clear, temperature 42°F, no precipitation in past 48 hours  

The contamination was first observed by maintenance worker Frank Kowalski during routine inspection of the loading area. Mr. Kowalski noted a strong chemical odor and visible discoloration of the ground surface extending from the concrete pad toward the gravel area used for temporary waste storage. Upon closer inspection, the affected area shows evidence of liquid chemical penetration into the soil to an undetermined depth.

The contaminated area measures approximately 15 feet by 13 feet and appears to originate from the vicinity of the temporary waste holding tanks positioned on the concrete loading pad. Visual inspection reveals dark staining of the soil consistent with organic solvent contamination. The affected ground shows a distinctive rainbow-colored sheen when disturbed, indicating the presence of petroleum-based chemicals or similar organic compounds.

## PROBABLE CAUSE

Initial investigation suggests the contamination resulted from overflow or spillage during waste transfer operations conducted over the past several days. The temporary holding tanks in this area are used to collect waste solvents from the Cryovac manufacturing process, including trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and other degreasing agents used in equipment maintenance.

Review of recent waste disposal activities indicates that on November 16, 1964, approximately 500 gallons of waste solvent were transferred from Building C operations to the temporary holding area. During this transfer, conducted by contracted waste hauler Northeastern Industrial Services, there may have been spillage due to inadequate containment procedures or equipment malfunction.

The concrete pad in the loading area shows signs of surface deterioration that may have contributed to the incident. Several cracks in the concrete surface, some measuring up to 1/4 inch in width, could have allowed liquid waste to penetrate through the pad and into the underlying soil. These surface defects were noted in previous maintenance reports but had not been scheduled for repair.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

Upon discovery of the contamination, the following immediate actions were implemented:

1. **Area Isolation:** The contaminated area was cordoned off with warning tape and temporary barriers to prevent personnel access and further disturbance of affected soil.

2. **Work Cessation:** All waste transfer operations in the rear loading area were suspended pending investigation and remediation.

3. **Personnel Safety:** All maintenance staff working in the vicinity were instructed to avoid the contaminated area and use appropriate personal protective equipment when working nearby.

4. **Documentation:** Photographs of the contaminated area were taken for record-keeping purposes and potential insurance claims.

5. **Notification:** Plant management and facility safety personnel were notified immediately of the incident and current containment measures.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The contaminated area is located approximately 150 feet from the eastern property boundary and roughly 300 feet from the Aberjona River. Given the industrial nature of the surrounding area and the presence of other manufacturing facilities in the vicinity, this incident should be evaluated in the context of overall facility environmental management practices.

Soil conditions in this area consist primarily of sandy loam with moderate permeability. Recent rainfall has been minimal, which may have limited the extent of contamination migration. However, the proximity to groundwater sources and the potential for seasonal water table fluctuations warrant careful consideration of remedial approaches.

The waste materials involved in this incident are consistent with normal manufacturing operations and include solvents commonly used throughout the industry for equipment cleaning and maintenance. These materials are handled in accordance with current industry standards and manufacturer recommendations for industrial chemical management.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the circumstances of this incident, the following recommendations are submitted for management consideration:

**Immediate Actions (0-7 days):**
- Engage qualified contractor to assess extent of soil contamination and recommend appropriate remediation methods
- Repair concrete surface defects in loading area to prevent future spillage incidents
- Review waste transfer procedures with contracted haulers to ensure proper containment protocols
- Install temporary drainage controls around contaminated area to prevent migration during precipitation events

**Short-term Actions (1-4 weeks):**
- Implement enhanced inspection procedures for waste storage and transfer operations
- Upgrade temporary holding tank systems with improved containment features
- Develop written protocols for incident response and contamination management
- Conduct training session for maintenance personnel on proper waste handling procedures

**Long-term Considerations:**
- Evaluate feasibility of permanent waste storage facility improvements to minimize spillage risk
- Review overall facility environmental management practices in consultation with corporate environmental affairs
- Consider installation of monitoring wells to track groundwater conditions in vicinity of waste operations
- Establish regular environmental audit schedule to identify potential issues before incidents occur

## REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

This incident should be evaluated against current Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations regarding industrial waste management and potential reporting requirements. While the contamination appears to be contained within facility boundaries, management should consider voluntary notification to appropriate regulatory authorities as a demonstration of corporate environmental responsibility.

The facility's current waste disposal permits and environmental compliance status should be reviewed to ensure this incident does not affect our standing with regulatory agencies. Documentation of remedial actions and environmental monitoring results may be beneficial for future permit renewals and regulatory interactions.

## CONCLUSION

This incident represents a significant environmental management challenge that requires prompt and comprehensive response. While the immediate contamination appears to be limited in scope, the potential for groundwater impact and regulatory scrutiny necessitates thorough investigation and remediation.

The proximity of this incident to municipal water supply sources and residential areas underscores the importance of maintaining the highest standards of environmental stewardship. Swift and effective action to address this contamination will demonstrate W.R. Grace Company's commitment to responsible industrial operations and community environmental protection.

I recommend immediate implementation of the short-term recommendations outlined above, with particular emphasis on contractor assessment of remediation requirements and repair of concrete surface defects that may have contributed to this incident.
