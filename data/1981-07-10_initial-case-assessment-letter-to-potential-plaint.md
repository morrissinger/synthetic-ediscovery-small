**Re: Preliminary Assessment of Potential Legal Claims Related to Childhood Leukemia Cases in East Woburn**

Dear Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Toomey:

Following our initial consultation on July 3rd regarding the tragic loss of your children and the concerning pattern of childhood leukemia cases in your East Woburn neighborhood, I am writing to provide you with my preliminary assessment of the potential legal claims that may be available to your families and others similarly situated.

## Background and Initial Findings

Based on our discussion and my review of the available information, I understand that both James Anderson and Patrick Toomey were diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia at young ages and that both families resided in the East Woburn area served by municipal Wells G and H. Mrs. Anderson, your son James was diagnosed in January 1972 at age three and tragically passed away on January 18, 1981, after a nine-year battle with this devastating disease. Mrs. Toomey, your son Patrick was diagnosed with leukemia and has been undergoing treatment. Both families have lived in homes connected to the municipal water system that draws from these wells.

What makes your cases particularly significant from a legal standpoint is the emerging evidence of industrial contamination in your neighborhood's water supply. My preliminary investigation has identified several industrial facilities in the vicinity that have historically used and disposed of chemical solvents, including trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), both of which are known carcinogens that can contaminate groundwater supplies.

## Potential Defendants and Theories of Liability

### Primary Industrial Defendants

**W.R. Grace Company and Cryovac Division**: This facility, located on Olympia Avenue, has operated a chemical manufacturing plant that produces food packaging materials. The industrial processes at this facility have historically involved the use of significant quantities of TCE and other chlorinated solvents. Based on preliminary information, there is reason to believe that improper disposal practices at this facility may have contributed to groundwater contamination affecting Wells G and H.

**Beatrice Foods Company**: Through its subsidiary operations, Beatrice has maintained industrial activities in the area that involved the use of chemical solvents. The company's potential liability stems from both direct operations and corporate responsibility for subsidiary activities that may have resulted in environmental contamination.

**John J. Riley Company**: This leather tanning and processing facility has historically used various chemical solvents in its operations and may have contributed to the contamination plume affecting your neighborhood's water supply.

### Legal Theories

**Negligence**: We would assert that these corporate defendants failed to exercise reasonable care in their handling, use, and disposal of hazardous chemicals, thereby creating an unreasonable risk of harm to members of the surrounding community. This negligence includes failure to properly contain chemical wastes, failure to monitor environmental impacts, and failure to warn the community of potential hazards.

**Wrongful Death**: For families who have lost children, including Mrs. Anderson's family, we would pursue wrongful death claims seeking damages for the loss of James's life, including the economic value of his lost future earnings, the loss of his companionship and society, and the pain and suffering endured by surviving family members.

**Causation**: Perhaps the most challenging aspect of these cases will be establishing the causal connection between the defendants' conduct and the development of leukemia in your children. We will need to develop expert testimony demonstrating that exposure to contaminated water from Wells G and H was a substantial contributing factor to the development of these cancers. This will require extensive medical and environmental expert analysis.

## Challenges and Considerations

I must be candid with you about the significant challenges these cases will present. Environmental contamination cases involving childhood cancer are among the most complex and expensive types of litigation in our legal system. The defendants will undoubtedly retain sophisticated legal counsel and expert witnesses who will challenge every aspect of our claims.

**Scientific Causation**: Establishing that specific chemical exposures caused particular cases of leukemia requires overcoming substantial scientific and legal hurdles. The defendants will argue that leukemia has multiple potential causes and that we cannot prove their specific actions caused your children's illnesses.

**Corporate Resources**: The companies we would be pursuing have substantial financial resources and will mount vigorous defenses. They will likely argue that their operations complied with all applicable regulations and that any contamination was within legally permissible limits.

**Regulatory Compliance Defense**: The defendants may claim that their activities were conducted in accordance with applicable environmental regulations and permits, potentially limiting their legal exposure.

## Potential Damages and Recovery

If we are successful in establishing liability and causation, the damages in these cases could be substantial. For wrongful death claims, we would seek compensation for:

- The economic value of the deceased child's lost future earnings
- Loss of companionship, guidance, and society to surviving family members  
- Medical expenses incurred in treating the illness
- Pain and suffering endured by the child and family members
- Punitive damages if we can establish that the defendants' conduct was particularly egregious

For families with children still undergoing treatment, we would seek compensation for ongoing medical expenses, pain and suffering, and the diminished quality of life resulting from the illness.

## Community-Wide Impact

It is important to understand that your cases are likely part of a broader pattern of environmental health impacts in your neighborhood. My preliminary research suggests that there may be additional families affected by similar health problems related to the contaminated water supply. A comprehensive legal action might involve multiple plaintiff families, which could strengthen our ability to establish causation and demonstrate the scope of the defendants' impact on your community.

## Next Steps and Recommendations

If you decide to proceed with legal action, the following steps will be necessary:

**Immediate Investigation**: We need to conduct a thorough investigation of the industrial facilities, their historical operations, waste disposal practices, and the extent of groundwater contamination. This will require hiring environmental consultants and obtaining access to corporate records through the discovery process.

**Medical Records Analysis**: We will need to compile comprehensive medical records for all affected children and have them reviewed by qualified medical experts who can testify about the relationship between chemical exposure and leukemia development.

**Community Health Study**: We should work to identify other potentially affected families in your neighborhood and document the full scope of health impacts associated with the contaminated water supply.

**Expert Witness Development**: Success in these cases will depend heavily on expert testimony from environmental scientists, toxicologists, epidemiologists, and medical professionals who can establish the causal connections between the defendants' activities and your children's illnesses.

## Financial Considerations

I want to be transparent about the financial realities of pursuing this litigation. Environmental contamination cases require substantial upfront investment in expert witnesses, environmental testing, document discovery, and other litigation expenses. These costs can easily reach hundreds of thousands of dollars before any recovery is achieved.

I am prepared to handle these cases on a contingency fee basis, meaning that you would not pay attorney's fees unless we achieve a successful outcome. However, you should understand that if we are unsuccessful, you could potentially be responsible for certain litigation costs, although I would work to minimize this exposure.

## Recommendation

Based on my preliminary assessment, I believe your cases present viable legal claims that warrant serious pursuit. The combination of documented childhood leukemia cases, proximity to industrial facilities using known carcinogens, and evidence of water supply contamination creates a compelling foundation for legal action.

However, I must emphasize that these cases will require a long-term commitment and significant resources. Environmental litigation of this type typically takes several years to resolve and involves substantial uncertainty regarding outcomes. You should carefully consider whether you and your families are prepared for the emotional and practical demands of extended litigation.

If you decide to proceed, I recommend that we move forward promptly to preserve evidence and begin the investigation process. Environmental contamination cases are subject to statutes of limitations that could bar claims if we delay too long.

I am prepared to meet with you again at your convenience to discuss any questions you may have about this assessment or to begin the formal process of initiating legal action. Please know that my office is committed to pursuing justice for your families and holding these corporate defendants accountable for the harm they have caused to your community.

Please contact my office at your earliest convenience to schedule a follow-up meeting. I believe that together we can build a strong case that will not only provide compensation for your families' losses but also ensure
