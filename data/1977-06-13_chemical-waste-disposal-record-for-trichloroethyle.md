### DISPOSAL PROCEDURE

**14:20** - Initiated pumping operation from storage area to lagoon system. All three containers transported via forklift to discharge point at northeast corner of property.

**14:35** - Connected discharge hose to Container TCE-77-041. Verified lagoon water level at 3.2 feet below rim capacity. Current lagoon contents appear normal with slight chemical odor present.

**14:45** - Completed discharge of first container. No visible spillage. Material mixed readily with existing lagoon contents. Surface shows typical rainbow sheen from petroleum-based solvents.

**15:10** - Discharged Container TCE-77-042. Noted increased surface activity and stronger solvent odor. Lagoon level now at 2.8 feet below rim.

**15:25** - Final container TCE-77-043 discharged without incident. Total operation time: 65 minutes. Final lagoon level: 2.4 feet below rim capacity.

### ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATIONS

**Soil Conditions:** Ground around lagoon appears saturated. Some discoloration noted in soil approximately 15 feet east of lagoon perimeter, consistent with previous observations.

**Groundwater:** No visible seepage at surface level. Monthly monitoring well readings scheduled for next week per company protocol.

**Air Quality:** Strong solvent odor dissipated within 30 minutes of completion. No unusual vapor concentrations observed.

**Wildlife:** No dead fish or other animals observed in lagoon area. Vegetation around perimeter shows normal spring growth patterns.
