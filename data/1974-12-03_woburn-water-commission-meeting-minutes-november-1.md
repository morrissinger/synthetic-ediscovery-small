### AGENDA ITEM 1: APPROVAL OF OCTOBER MEETING MINUTES

Commissioner McCarthy moved to approve the October 21, 1974 meeting minutes as distributed. Commissioner Keefe seconded the motion. **Motion carried unanimously.**

### AGENDA ITEM 2: WATER QUALITY REPORTS

Water Superintendent Henderson presented the monthly water quality summary for October 1974. Wells G and H continue to operate at full capacity, providing approximately 2.8 million gallons per day to the municipal system. Henderson reported that routine bacteriological testing shows all samples within acceptable parameters as established by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

Commissioner O'Brien inquired about the taste complaints received from residents in the East Woburn area, particularly along Montvale Road and Salem Street. Henderson acknowledged receiving approximately twelve complaints in October regarding metallic taste and occasional odor issues. He explained that these concerns have been attributed to seasonal changes in groundwater conditions and increased industrial activity in the area affecting the aquifer.

Henderson noted that Wells G and H draw from the same general aquifer system as the Aberjona River watershed, which has experienced increased industrial discharge in recent years. He recommended continued monitoring but indicated that current testing protocols focus primarily on bacteriological contamination rather than chemical analysis, which would require specialized laboratory services not currently budgeted.

**Action Item:** Henderson to contact the state health department regarding expanded testing protocols if complaints continue to increase.

### AGENDA ITEM 3: SYSTEM MAINTENANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Assistant Superintendent Collins reported on routine maintenance activities for October 1974. The Wells G and H pumping stations operated without significant mechanical issues. Routine chlorination equipment maintenance was completed on schedule.

Collins noted that the wellhead areas around both Wells G and H require improved security fencing, as there have been reports of unauthorized access and debris accumulation near the facilities. He recommended budget allocation for enhanced perimeter security in the 1975 fiscal year.

Commissioner Brennan raised concerns about the proximity of industrial facilities to the wellhead protection areas. He specifically mentioned observations of truck traffic and storage activities at properties adjacent to the Aberjona River, upstream from the wells. Henderson acknowledged these observations but noted that the Commission's jurisdiction extends only to the immediate wellhead areas and distribution system.

### AGENDA ITEM 4: BUDGET REVIEW FOR FISCAL YEAR 1975

Chairman Sullivan presented the preliminary budget proposal for fiscal year 1975, totaling $284,600 for water system operations. Key budget items include:

- Personnel costs: $156,200
- Chemical treatment supplies: $18,400
- Equipment maintenance: $32,800
- Utilities and power: $41,200
- Administrative expenses: $12,000
- Capital improvements: $24,000

Commissioner McCarthy questioned whether the chemical treatment budget adequately addresses potential need for enhanced water treatment if quality issues persist. Henderson responded that current chlorination protocols are sufficient for bacteriological treatment, and that any expanded chemical treatment would require engineering consultation and additional state approvals.

The Commission discussed the capital improvements allocation, with particular attention to wellhead security enhancements and potential backup power systems for the pumping stations. Commissioner Keefe emphasized the importance of maintaining uninterrupted water service to all municipal customers.

**Motion:** Commissioner O'Brien moved to approve the preliminary budget as presented, with authorization for Henderson to investigate costs for enhanced water quality testing capabilities. Commissioner Brennan seconded. **Motion carried 4-1, with Commissioner McCarthy abstaining.**

### AGENDA ITEM 5: CORRESPONDENCE AND COMMUNICATIONS

Secretary Ryan reported receiving three formal complaints from residents regarding water quality issues in October 1974:

1. Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Zona, 108 Montvale Road - metallic taste and discoloration
2. Mrs. Anne Anderson, Salem Street - persistent chemical odor
3. Mr. Carl Robbins Sr., East Woburn - taste and odor concerns

Henderson noted that field visits were conducted to each location, with water samples collected for routine bacteriological testing. All samples showed negative results for bacterial contamination. He recommended that residents experiencing taste or odor issues run water for several minutes before consumption to clear any sediment from service lines.

Commissioner O'Brien suggested that the Commission consider establishing a more formal complaint tracking system to identify patterns in water quality concerns. She noted that several complaints have originated from the same general geographic area served by Wells G and H.

### AGENDA ITEM 6: NEW BUSINESS

Commissioner Keefe reported receiving informal inquiries from residents about potential health concerns related to water quality. He noted that several families in East Woburn have experienced illness, and some residents have questioned whether water quality might be a contributing factor.

Henderson emphasized that the municipal water system meets all current state and federal standards for potable water. He noted that any health-related concerns should be directed to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health or individual physicians, as the Water Commission lacks medical expertise to evaluate such matters.

Chairman Sullivan recommended that staff prepare informational materials for distribution to residents explaining the Commission's water quality testing procedures and standards. This information should clarify the Commission's role and responsibilities while directing health-related inquiries to appropriate authorities.

**Action Item:** Henderson and Ryan to prepare public information materials regarding water quality standards and testing procedures for distribution by January 1975.

### AGENDA ITEM 7: EXECUTIVE SESSION

At 9:15 PM, Chairman Sullivan called for executive session to discuss personnel matters. Commissioner McCarthy moved to enter executive session. Commissioner Keefe seconded. **Motion carried unanimously.**

Regular session reconvened at 9:35 PM with no action taken during executive session.

### ADJOURNMENT

With no further business, Commissioner Brennan moved to adjourn the meeting. Commissioner O'Brien seconded the motion. **Motion carried unanimously.**

Meeting adjourned at 9:40 PM.

**Next scheduled meeting:** December 16, 1974, 7:30 PM, Woburn City Hall
