### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carl Robbins III is a 9-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed in September 1979. Patient was initially treated with standard induction chemotherapy protocol including vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase, achieving complete remission by November 1979. However, patient has experienced significant complications during maintenance therapy, including severe mucositis, prolonged neutropenia, and recurrent infections requiring multiple hospitalizations.

Over the past week, parents report patient has been increasingly lethargic with decreased appetite and complaints of severe abdominal cramping. Patient has experienced daily nosebleeds for the past four days, with episodes lasting 15-20 minutes despite direct pressure. Mother notes development of new bruising on extremities and trunk without history of trauma. Patient has been unable to attend school for the past two weeks due to weakness and recurring fevers.

Father reports family has resided at current address since 1975, with domestic water supplied by municipal wells. Patient spent significant time outdoors playing in neighborhood during summer months prior to diagnosis. No known family history of hematologic malignancies.

### ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

**Primary Diagnosis:** Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with disease progression and treatment-related complications

**Secondary Diagnoses:**
1. Severe pancytopenia secondary to chemotherapy
2. Acute hepatotoxicity, likely chemotherapy-related
3. Coagulopathy with bleeding tendency
4. Failure to thrive
5. Mucositis, Grade 3

**Immediate Management:**
1. **Supportive Care:** Patient admitted to pediatric oncology unit with neutropenic precautions. Private room with reverse isolation protocols.

2. **Hematologic Support:** Platelet transfusion ordered for count <20,000. Type and crossmatch for packed red blood cell transfusion given hemoglobin <7.0 g/dL.

3. **Infection Prevention:** Blood cultures obtained. Empiric antibiotic therapy with cefepime 50 mg/kg every 8 hours pending culture results.

4. **Nutritional Support:** NPO initially due to severe mucositis. TPN consultation requested for nutritional rehabilitation.

5. **Pain Management:** Patient reports severe abdominal pain (8/10 scale). Morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV every 4 hours PRN for pain control.

6. **Hepatic Monitoring:** Hold methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine pending normalization of liver function tests. Daily monitoring of hepatic panel.

**Progn
