# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Plant Manager - Woburn Facility  
**FROM:** Robert H. Mitchell, Environmental Compliance Officer  
**DATE:** March 18, 1975  
**RE:** Internal Memo on Solvent Disposal Reporting Procedures

## Current Disposal Protocol Review

Following recent discussions with corporate counsel regarding regulatory compliance matters, I am documenting our current solvent disposal procedures for the Woburn facility operations. This memo serves to clarify reporting requirements and establish consistent documentation practices across all departments handling industrial solvents, particularly trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and related chlorinated compounds utilized in our manufacturing processes.

Our current disposal operations involve the discharge of process wastewater containing trace amounts of industrial solvents through our permitted outfall system. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering has not established specific reporting thresholds for these compounds in industrial discharge permits, and federal EPA guidelines remain under development. However, given the proximity of municipal water supply wells in the East Woburn area, we should maintain detailed records of all solvent usage and disposal activities to demonstrate our commitment to responsible environmental stewardship.

## Documentation Requirements

Effective immediately, all departments must maintain monthly logs documenting solvent quantities used in production processes and disposal methods employed. These logs should include specific chemical identities, approximate volumes, disposal dates, and the names of personnel responsible for disposal activities. While current regulations do not mandate such detailed record-keeping for our classification of industrial facility, maintaining comprehensive documentation will support our position as a responsible corporate citizen should any questions arise regarding our environmental practices.

The recent concerns raised by some community members regarding water quality in the East Woburn area make it prudent for us to demonstrate our adherence to all applicable environmental standards. Although no regulatory agency has identified any connection between industrial activities and local health concerns, our proactive documentation approach will provide evidence of our commitment to environmental compliance and community safety.

## Recommended Actions

I recommend that we schedule quarterly meetings with department supervisors to review disposal procedures and ensure consistent implementation of these documentation requirements. Additionally, we should consider engaging with local officials to address any community concerns through transparent communication about our environmental practices. Our legal department has advised that maintaining detailed records of our disposal activities will support our defense of responsible corporate conduct should any future inquiries arise regarding our operations.

Please ensure that all relevant personnel receive copies of this memo and implement the documentation procedures no later than April 1, 1975. If you have any questions regarding these requirements or need clarification on specific disposal procedures, please contact me at extension 247.
