# W.R. GRACE COMPANY
## ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY INSPECTION LOG

**INSPECTION DATE:** August 9, 1963  
**TIME:** 1:00 PM - 4:30 PM  
**INSPECTOR:** Harold M. Peterson, Safety Inspector  
**FACILITY:** Woburn Manufacturing Plant - Chemical Processing Division  
**LOCATION:** 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts  

---

### INSPECTION SUMMARY

**Purpose:** Quarterly safety inspection of chemical storage areas and waste disposal facilities in compliance with company safety protocols. Particular attention directed to solvent storage and drum handling procedures per directive from Environmental Compliance Officer dated July 15, 1963.

**Weather Conditions:** Clear, 78°F, light southwest wind  
**Personnel Present:** H. Peterson (Inspector), Frank Kowalski (Plant Supervisor), Thomas McCarthy (Maintenance Foreman)

### AREA 1: MAIN SOLVENT STORAGE FACILITY

**Location:** Building 7-A, North Storage Bay  
**Time Inspected:** 1:15 PM - 2:00 PM

**Observations:**
- Total drum count: 347 drums of various sizes (30-gallon and 55-gallon capacity)
- Primary solvents stored: Trichloroethylene (TCE), Perchloroethylene (PCE), Carbon Tetrachloride, Methylene Chloride
- Storage arrangement: Drums arranged in rows of twelve, stacked maximum two high
- Ventilation: Adequate mechanical ventilation system operational

**Condition Assessment:**
- **SATISFACTORY:** 312 drums showing no visible signs of deterioration or leakage
- **ATTENTION REQUIRED:** 23 drums showing minor surface rust but structural integrity intact
- **IMMEDIATE CONCERN:** 12 drums showing advanced corrosion with visible staining around base

**Specific Findings:**
1. Drums #A-447 through #A-458 (located in southeast corner) exhibit significant bottom corrosion
2. Dark staining observed on concrete floor beneath affected drums, approximately 15 square feet total area
3. Strong solvent odor detected in vicinity of compromised drums
4. Floor drain located 8 feet from affected storage area - no visible contamination of drain system at time of inspection

---

### AREA 2: SPENT SOLVENT DRUM STAGING AREA

**Location:** Outdoor yard area, west of Building 7-A  
**Time Inspected:** 2:15 PM - 3:00 PM

**Current Inventory:**
- 89 drums designated for off-site disposal
- 34 drums awaiting content analysis prior to disposal determination
- 12 drums recently emptied, pending cleaning and return to service

**Critical Observations:**
The spent solvent staging area presents several operational concerns that require immediate management attention:

**Drum Condition Issues:**
- Fifteen (15) drums show evidence of contents seepage, with dark liquid pooling beneath drum clusters
- Seven (7) drums exhibit bulging sides, indicating potential internal pressure buildup
- Multiple drums lack proper hazard identification labels or show severely weathered labeling

**Ground Conditions:**
- Soil discoloration observed over approximately 200 square feet of staging area
- Strong chemical odors emanating from ground surface, particularly in areas of heaviest drum concentration
- No impermeable surface or containment system present in staging area
- Surface water runoff from recent rainfall shows oily sheen and chemical odor

**Proximity Concerns:**
- Staging area located approximately 150 feet from Aberjona River
- Natural drainage slope directs surface water toward river system
- No barrier or collection system in place to prevent migration of spilled materials

---

### AREA 3: DRUM HANDLING AND TRANSPORT ZONE

**Location:** Loading dock area, Building 7-A south entrance  
**Time Inspected:** 3:15 PM - 3:45 PM

**Equipment Inspection:**
- Fork truck #3 showing hydraulic fluid leakage onto dock surface
- Drum handling equipment generally in acceptable condition
- Safety equipment (spill kits, protective gear) present but quantities appear insufficient for facility size

**Procedural Observations:**
- Witnessed drum transfer operation during inspection period
- Workers demonstrated proper lifting techniques and use of mechanical equipment
- However, noted absence of secondary containment during transfer operations
- No immediate spill response materials visible in work area

---

### REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

**Current Practices:**
The facility's current chemical storage and waste handling procedures reflect standard industry practices for 1963. However, several areas warrant attention from a risk management perspective:

**Documentation:**
- Chemical inventory records maintained in satisfactory condition
- Disposal manifests properly filed for off-site waste removal
- Worker safety training records current for all personnel handling hazardous materials

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Installation of secondary containment systems in outdoor staging areas
2. Replacement of corroded drums on accelerated schedule
3. Implementation of regular ground monitoring in areas of chemical storage
4. Enhanced surface water management around outdoor storage areas

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (Within 30 days):**
1. Replace all drums showing signs of structural compromise (24 drums total)
2. Remove contaminated soil from staging area and dispose through approved channels
3. Install temporary containment barriers around outdoor drum storage
4. Increase frequency of drum condition inspections to weekly schedule

**SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENTS (Within 90 days):**
1. Construct concrete pad with containment curbing for spent solvent staging area
2. Install drain collection system with separator for processing area runoff
3. Upgrade ventilation system in Building 7-A storage areas
4. Implement formal drum rotation schedule to prevent extended storage of aging containers

**LONG-TERM PLANNING (Within 12 months):**
1. Evaluate feasibility of covered storage facility for spent solvent drums
2. Assess current disposal contractor performance and explore alternatives
3. Consider installation of groundwater monitoring wells adjacent to storage areas
4. Develop comprehensive spill response procedures specific to solvent handling operations
