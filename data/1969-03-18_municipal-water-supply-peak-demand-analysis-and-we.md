# Municipal Water Supply Peak Demand Analysis and Well Activation Report

**Woburn Water Department**  
City Hall, 10 Common Street  
Woburn, Massachusetts 01801

**TO:** Thomas P. McCarthy, City Manager  
**FROM:** Robert M. Sullivan, Water Department Superintendent  
**DATE:** March 18, 1969  
**RE:** Peak Demand Analysis and Supplemental Well Activation Protocol

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of our winter demand analysis and establishes protocols for the activation of supplemental Wells G and H during periods of increased municipal water consumption. Based on consumption data from January through March 1969, we anticipate significant strain on our primary water sources during the upcoming summer months and recommend expanded utilization of our newer well facilities to meet projected demand.

## Current System Status

The Woburn municipal water system currently operates six active wells, with our primary sources (Wells A through F) providing an average daily output of 2.8 million gallons during normal demand periods. Wells G and H, completed in 1964 and 1966 respectively, have served as supplemental sources during peak demand periods, contributing an additional 1.2 million gallons per day when fully operational.

### Well Performance Analysis

**Primary Wells (A-F):**
- Combined daily capacity: 3.2 million gallons
- Average winter output: 2.8 million gallons
- Efficiency rating: 87.5%
- Service area: Central and West Woburn

**Supplemental Wells (G-H):**
- Well G: Depth 88 feet, capacity 600,000 gallons/day
- Well H: Depth 90 feet, capacity 600,000 gallons/day
- Combined capacity: 1.2 million gallons/day
- Primary service area: East Woburn residential districts

## Demand Projections

Based on historical consumption patterns and recent residential development in East Woburn, we project the following demand increases for the 1969 summer season:

- **June-August Peak Demand:** 4.1-4.3 million gallons/day
- **Sustained Summer Average:** 3.8 million gallons/day
- **Critical Peak Days:** Up to 4.5 million gallons/day

These projections represent a 15% increase over 1968 summer consumption, attributed primarily to:
- New residential construction along Wood Street and surrounding areas
- Expanded industrial operations requiring municipal water service
- Projected temperature increases based on weather service forecasts

## Well Activation Protocol

To meet anticipated demand, I recommend implementation of the following activation schedule for Wells G and H:

### Phase 1 Activation (May 15 - June 30)
- Activate Well G during daily peak hours (6:00 AM - 10:00 AM, 5:00 PM - 9:00 PM)
- Maintain Well H in standby status
- Estimated additional supply: 300,000 gallons/day

### Phase 2 Activation (July 1 - August 31)
- Continuous operation of Well G
- Activate Well H during peak demand periods
- Combined additional supply: 800,000-1,200,000 gallons/day

### Emergency Protocol
- Full activation of both wells during system emergencies or demand exceeding 4.2 million gallons/day
- Coordination with Massachusetts Department of Public Health for extended high-capacity operations

## Water Quality Considerations

Recent testing of Wells G and H indicates compliance with all state and federal water quality standards. Laboratory analysis conducted February 28, 1969, by Commonwealth Laboratories of Boston shows:

- **Bacterial Count:** Zero coliform per 100ml sample
- **Chemical Analysis:** Within acceptable limits for all tested parameters
- **pH Level:** 6.8-7.2 (optimal range)
- **Hardness:** 125 ppm (moderate)
- **Iron Content:** 0.3 ppm (acceptable)

Both wells draw from the Aberjona River watershed aquifer at depths sufficient to ensure natural filtration and protection from surface contamination. The aquifer formation provides excellent water quality with minimal treatment requirements beyond standard chlorination.

## Infrastructure Requirements

To support expanded operations of Wells G and H, the following infrastructure improvements are recommended:

### Immediate Requirements (April 1969)
- Pump maintenance and calibration for both wells
- Electrical system inspection and upgrade of control panels
- Pipeline inspection from well heads to distribution mains
- Installation of additional flow monitoring equipment

### Long-term Improvements (1970-1971)
- Expansion of chlorination facilities to accommodate increased throughput
- Backup generator installation for emergency operations
- Enhanced water quality monitoring equipment

## Distribution System Impact

Activation of Wells G and H will provide enhanced service to the following areas:

- **Primary Benefit Zone:** East Woburn residential areas east of Main Street (Route 38)
- **Secondary Benefit:** Improved system pressure throughout central distribution network
- **Industrial Service:** Enhanced capacity for commercial and light industrial users

The elevated position of both well sites provides natural pressure advantages for the eastern service area, reducing strain on the central pumping system during peak demand periods.

## Financial Analysis

Operating costs for expanded well utilization are projected as follows:

- **Electrical Costs:** Additional $180/month per well during active periods
- **Maintenance:** $350/month for both wells combined
- **Chemical Treatment:** $75/month additional chlorination supplies
- **Total Additional Operating Cost:** $785/month during peak season

These costs represent a 12% increase in operational expenses but will be offset by improved system reliability and reduced wear on primary well equipment.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Implementation:** Authorize Phase 1 activation protocol beginning May 15, 1969
2. **Staff Training:** Conduct operator training for expanded well operations by April 30
3. **Monitoring Program:** Establish enhanced water quality monitoring during supplemental well operations
4. **Public Communication:** Prepare public information materials regarding expanded service capacity
5. **Emergency Planning:** Develop contingency protocols for extended high-demand periods

## Conclusion

The activation of Wells G and H represents a prudent expansion of municipal water capacity to meet growing demand in our service area. These facilities provide high-quality water from a reliable aquifer source and will ensure adequate supply during the anticipated high-demand summer period. Implementation of the recommended activation schedule will maintain service quality while supporting continued residential and commercial growth in Woburn.

I recommend approval of this activation protocol and authorization to proceed with the necessary preparations for expanded operations beginning in May 1969.
