## Abstract

This epidemiological assessment examines childhood leukemia incidence rates in Census Tract 3312 (East Woburn, Massachusetts) for the period 1969-1979 compared to state and national baseline rates. The analysis was initiated following reports of elevated childhood leukemia cases in neighborhoods served by municipal Wells G and H, which were closed in May 1979 due to volatile organic compound contamination. Statistical analysis reveals a statistically significant elevation in acute lymphocytic leukemia incidence among children ages 0-19 residing in the affected area during the study period.

## Introduction

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Environmental Epidemiology Branch initiated this health assessment in response to a formal request from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health dated October 15, 1979. The request followed the discovery of volatile organic compound contamination in East Woburn's municipal Wells G and H and concurrent reports of childhood leukemia cases in neighborhoods served by these water sources.

Census Tract 3312 encompasses the eastern portion of Woburn, Massachusetts, including residential areas primarily served by Wells G and H during their operational period from 1964-1979. The tract boundaries encompass approximately 2.3 square miles with a 1970 census population of 5,969 residents, including 1,847 children under age 20.

This study employs standardized epidemiological methods to calculate age-adjusted incidence rates and compare observed versus expected case numbers based on Massachusetts Tumor Registry data and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program baseline rates.

## Methodology

### Case Identification

Childhood leukemia cases were identified through multiple surveillance sources:
- Massachusetts Tumor Registry records (1969-1979)
- Hospital discharge records from Massachusetts General Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, and other regional facilities
- Death certificates from Massachusetts Department of Vital Statistics
- Physician reporting through the Massachusetts Department of Public Health

Cases were included if they met the following criteria:
- Diagnosis of acute leukemia (any subtype)
- Age at diagnosis 0-19 years
- Residence in Census Tract 3312 at time of diagnosis
- Diagnosis date between January 1, 1969 and December 31, 1979

### Population Data

Population denominators were derived from:
- 1970 U.S. Census enumeration data
- Annual population estimates from Massachusetts Department of Commerce
- Birth and death records for intercensal adjustments

### Statistical Analysis

Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated using direct standardization to the 1970 U.S. population. Expected case numbers were computed using Massachusetts state rates (1969-1979) and SEER program rates for comparison populations. Statistical significance was assessed using Poisson probability distributions and 95% confidence intervals.

## Results

### Case Enumeration

A total of twelve (12) cases of childhood leukemia were identified in Census Tract 3312 during the study period 1969-1979:

**Confirmed Cases:**
- James Anderson (age 3, diagnosed 1972)
- Kevin Kane Jr. (age 2, diagnosed 1973)
- Michael Zona (age 7, diagnosed 1974)
- Patrick Toomey (age 4, diagnosed 1975)
- Carl Robbins III (age 5, diagnosed 1976)
- Roland Gamache (age 6, diagnosed 1977)
- [Six additional cases with identities withheld per privacy protocols]

**Diagnostic Distribution:**
- Acute lymphocytic leukemia: 10 cases (83.3%)
- Acute myelogenous leukemia: 2 cases (16.7%)

**Age Distribution:**
- Ages 0-4: 7 cases (58.3%)
- Ages 5-9: 4 cases (33.3%)
- Ages 10-14: 1 case (8.3%)
- Ages 15-19: 0 cases (0%)

### Incidence Rate Analysis

**Observed vs. Expected Cases:**
- Observed cases: 12
- Expected cases (Massachusetts rates): 4.2
- Expected cases (SEER rates): 3.8
- Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR): 2.86 (95% CI: 1.48-5.00)

**Age-Adjusted Incidence Rate:**
- Census Tract 3312: 65.4 per 100,000 person-years
- Massachusetts (1969-1979): 22.8 per 100,000 person-years
- SEER Program (1973-1979): 20.6 per 100,000 person-years

**Temporal Distribution:**
The cases show clustering in the mid-1970s period, with 8 of 12 cases (66.7%) diagnosed between 1974-1977.

**Geographic Distribution:**
Residential addresses at time of diagnosis show concentration in areas served by Wells G and H water distribution system. Nine of twelve cases (75%) resided within 0.5 miles of either well site.

### Statistical Significance

The observed excess of childhood leukemia cases in Census Tract 3312 is statistically significant:
- Poisson probability of observing 12 or more cases given expectation of 4.2: p < 0.001
- 95% confidence interval for SIR (1.48-5.00) excludes unity
- Chi-square goodness of fit test: χ² = 14.5, p < 0.001

## Discussion

The epidemiological evidence demonstrates a statistically significant elevation in childhood leukemia incidence in Census Tract 3312 during the period 1969-1979. The nearly three-fold increase in incidence compared to state and national baseline rates represents a substantial public health concern requiring further investigation.

### Temporal Considerations

The temporal distribution of cases shows peak incidence during 1974-1977, corresponding to the period of maximum well utilization and preceding the discovery of contamination by approximately 2-5 years. This temporal pattern is consistent with a latency period between exposure and disease manifestation, though the relatively short latency observed suggests either high-level exposure or enhanced susceptibility in the pediatric population.

### Geographic Pattern

The concentration of cases in areas served by Wells G and H water distribution system provides supporting evidence for a water-borne exposure pathway. The proximity of case residences to well sites suggests a dose-response relationship consistent with groundwater contamination as a potential causal factor.

### Comparison Populations

The selection of appropriate comparison populations is critical for valid inference. Massachusetts state rates provide the most relevant demographic and socioeconomic comparison, while SEER program data offer broader geographic representation. The consistency of findings across both comparison groups strengthens the validity of observed associations.

## Environmental Context

Wells G and H, operational from 1964-1979, were closed in May 1979 following detection of volatile organic compounds including trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and chloroform. Environmental investigations have identified multiple potential sources of groundwater contamination in the Aberjona River Valley, including industrial facilities operated by W.R. Grace Company (Cryovac division) and properties owned by Beatrice Foods Inc.

The temporal relationship between well operation and case occurrence, combined with the geographic clustering of cases in areas served by contaminated wells, provides epidemiological support for a causal association between water supply contamination and childhood leukemia incidence.

## Limitations

This study is subject to several methodological limitations:

1. **Small sample size:** The relatively small number of cases limits statistical power for subgroup analyses and precise risk estimation.

2. **Exposure assessment:** Direct measurement of individual exposure levels is not available, requiring reliance on residential proximity and water system service areas as exposure surrogates.

3. **Confounding factors:** Potential confounding by socioeconomic status, genetic factors, or other environmental exposures cannot be definitively excluded.

4. **Temporal precision:** The exact timing of exposure relative to disease onset cannot be precisely determined given the limitations of available exposure data.

## Conclusions

The epidemiological evidence demonstrates
