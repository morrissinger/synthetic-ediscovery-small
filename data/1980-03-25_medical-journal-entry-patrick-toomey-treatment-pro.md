# Medical Journal Entry - Patrick Toomey Treatment Progress

**Date:** March 25, 1980  
**Time:** 7:00 PM  
**Recording Parent:** Margaret Toomey

## Daily Condition Report

Patrick had another difficult day today. The chemotherapy session at Children's Hospital on Monday has left him extremely weak and nauseous. He couldn't keep down his breakfast this morning - just crackers and ginger ale, and even that came back up around 10 AM. Dr. Weinstein warned us that this round would be harder on him, but seeing our little boy suffer like this breaks my heart every single day.

His white blood cell count from yesterday's lab work was still dangerously low at 1,200. Normal for a child his age should be between 5,000 and 10,000. The nurses keep reminding us about infection precautions - no visitors, wash hands constantly, keep him away from crowds. It's like we're living in a bubble, but even that doesn't feel safe anymore.

## Physical Symptoms Observed

- **Morning:** Severe nausea, vomiting clear fluid
- **Afternoon:** Complained of bone pain in his legs and arms - gave him the prescribed Tylenol with codeine at 2 PM
- **Evening:** Slight fever of 100.2°F at 6 PM - called Dr. Weinstein's service, they said to monitor closely and call if it reaches 101°F
- **Appetite:** Refused lunch entirely, managed half a bowl of chicken broth for dinner
- **Energy Level:** Stayed in bed most of the day, too tired to even watch his favorite TV shows

The hair loss is becoming more noticeable. Found clumps on his pillow this morning. He asked me why this is happening to him, and I didn't know what to say. How do you explain leukemia to a seven-year-old? How do you tell him that something in our water - the water we gave him every day, the water we trusted - might have caused this nightmare?

## Emotional State

Patrick seems to understand more than we give him credit for. Today he asked me if the other sick children from the neighborhood got sick the same way he did. I think he's starting to connect the dots - Jimmy Anderson from Pine Street, little Kevin Kane, Michael Zona from his class. They're all fighting the same battle.

He's been having nightmares again. Last night he woke up crying, saying he dreamed about "bad water" making all the kids sick. Tom and I have tried to shield him from our conversations about the wells and the companies, but children hear more than we realize.

## Treatment Response

This is Patrick's fourth month of treatment since his diagnosis in November. The protocol Dr. Weinstein outlined includes:

- **Induction Phase:** Completed in December - achieved remission
- **Consolidation Phase:** Currently ongoing - weekly chemotherapy sessions
- **Maintenance Phase:** Expected to begin in May if current treatment continues to show progress

The bone marrow biopsy scheduled for next week will tell us if he's maintaining remission. I'm terrified of what they might find, but we have to know if the treatment is working.

## Questions for Dr. Weinstein

1. When might his energy levels improve?
2. Are the bone pain episodes normal at this stage?
3. Should we be concerned about his refusal to eat?
4. How long before his hair starts growing back?
5. What are the long-term effects we should prepare for?

## Family Impact

Tom has been working double shifts at the garage to pay for the medical bills. The insurance covers some of it, but not everything. The experimental treatments, the special medications, the constant hospital visits - it all adds up faster than we ever imagined.

I had to take leave from my job at the department store. Patrick needs someone with him constantly, and I can't bear the thought of him being alone when he feels this sick. The other mothers in the neighborhood - Mrs. Anderson, Mrs. Kane, Mrs. Zona - we've formed an informal support group. We take turns driving to appointments, share information about treatments, and hold each other up when the fear becomes overwhelming.

## Environmental Concerns

The wells have been closed for almost a year now, but the damage was already done. Fifteen years of contaminated water flowing through our pipes, into our glasses, our cooking, our children's bottles. The state health department keeps asking questions, taking samples, conducting studies. But what good does that do Patrick now?

I keep thinking about all those times I told him to drink his water, to finish his glass at dinner. "Water is good for you, honey. It helps you grow big and strong." The irony is bitter and cruel.

## Hope and Determination

Despite everything, Patrick still smiles. Not as often as before, but when he does, it lights up the whole room. Today he told me he wants to be a doctor when he grows up so he can help other kids who are sick. That's our boy - even in his darkest moments, thinking about others.

We will get through this. We have to. Patrick is strong, stronger than any seven-year-old should have to be. And if those companies are responsible for what happened to our children, they will be held accountable. The lawyers have been asking questions, and we're documenting everything - every symptom, every treatment, every moment of pain our son has endured.

For now, we take it one day at a time, one treatment at a time, one small victory at a time. Tomorrow is another day, and tomorrow Patrick will still be fighting. And so will we.
