## INITIAL COMPLAINT DETAILS

On May 11, 1979, this Department received a telephone complaint from Mrs. Margaret Kane regarding her concern about potential environmental factors contributing to her son's recent leukemia diagnosis. Mrs. Kane expressed specific concerns about the quality of municipal water supplied to her East Woburn neighborhood and requested investigation into possible connections between water contamination and childhood illness in the area.

During the initial telephone intake conducted by Environmental Health Specialist Robert Chen on May 11, 1979, Mrs. Kane reported the following key information:

**Timeline of Health Events:**
- November 1978: Kevin Kane Jr. began experiencing persistent fatigue and frequent nosebleeds
- December 1978: Child developed recurring fever and complained of joint pain
- January 15, 1979: Initial medical consultation with Dr. Robert Truman, pediatrician
- January 22, 1979: Blood work revealed abnormal white cell count
- January 28, 1979: Referral to Dr. Patricia Healey, pediatric hematologist at Massachusetts General Hospital
- February 5, 1979: Bone marrow biopsy confirmed acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosis
- February 12, 1979: Chemotherapy treatment initiated

**Environmental Concerns Expressed:**
Mrs. Kane reported that her family has resided at their current address since 1965 and has consumed municipal water exclusively. She noted that the water supplied to her home has occasionally exhibited unusual taste and odor characteristics, particularly during summer months between 1976-1978. Specifically, she described the water as sometimes having a "chemical" or "sweet" taste and a faint odor reminiscent of cleaning solvents.

Mrs. Kane also reported awareness of at least two other families in her immediate neighborhood whose children have been diagnosed with leukemia within the past eighteen months. She identified these families as the Anderson family (Pine Street) and the Zona family (Maple Street), though she emphasized that she has not discussed medical details with these families directly.

## PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

**Geographic Analysis:**
The complainant's residence at 14 Maple Street falls within the service area of municipal Wells G and H, which have provided supplemental water supply to eastern Woburn since 1964 and 1966 respectively. Initial review of water distribution records indicates that approximately 40% of the Kane family's water supply during the period 1976-1979 originated from these wells, with the remainder supplied by the older municipal well system.

**Industrial Activity Assessment:**
Preliminary mapping of industrial facilities in the vicinity of Wells G and H reveals the presence of several operations utilizing organic solvents and chemical compounds:

1. **Cryovac Inc. (W.R. Grace subsidiary)** - 369 Washington Street
   - Distance from Wells G and H: Approximately 1,200 feet northeast
   - Operations: Packaging machinery manufacturing
   - Known chemical usage: Trichloroethylene, methylene chloride, various organic solvents

2. **John J. Riley Company (Beatrice Foods subsidiary)** - 228 Salem Street
   - Distance from Wells G and H: Approximately 800 feet southwest
   - Operations: Leather tanning and processing
   - Known chemical usage: Chromium compounds, organic solvents, tanning agents

**Water Quality Records Review:**
Initial examination of available municipal water testing records for Wells G and H reveals that routine bacteriological testing has been conducted in accordance with state requirements. However, testing for volatile organic compounds has not been performed on these wells since their installation. The most recent comprehensive chemical analysis was conducted in 1967 for Well G and 1968 for Well H, focusing primarily on standard inorganic parameters.

## RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

Based on the preliminary assessment of this complaint, the following immediate actions are recommended:

**1. Expanded Health Surveillance**
- Initiate systematic canvas of neighborhoods served by Wells G and H to identify additional cases of childhood leukemia or other hematologic malignancies
- Establish case registry for all childhood cancers diagnosed among residents of East Woburn since 1970
- Coordinate with Massachusetts Cancer Registry to obtain comprehensive data on cancer incidence in Woburn

**2. Water Quality Investigation**
- Conduct immediate testing of Wells G and H for volatile organic compounds, with emphasis on trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and related industrial solvents
- Implement temporary increased monitoring frequency pending results of initial testing
- Review historical maintenance and operational records for both wells

**3. Environmental Assessment**
- Conduct preliminary site assessment of industrial facilities in the Wells G and H recharge area
- Review available records regarding waste disposal practices at identified facilities
- Coordinate with Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering regarding potential groundwater contamination sources

**4. Medical Consultation**
- Establish consultation with pediatric oncology specialists familiar with environmental causation of childhood leukemia
- Review available literature regarding associations between solvent exposure and childhood hematologic malignancies
- Develop protocol for medical evaluation of potentially affected children
