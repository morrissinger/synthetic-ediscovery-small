## INDUSTRIAL SOLVENT SAFETY AND HANDLING GUIDELINES

**Document Number:** CSG-1962-001  
**Revision:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** January 17, 1962  
**Distribution:** All Manufacturing Personnel  
**Classification:** Internal Use Only

## 1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

This technical guidance document establishes mandatory safety protocols for the handling, storage, and disposal of industrial solvents utilized in Cryovac Inc. manufacturing operations. These guidelines have been developed by the Cryovac Safety Department in accordance with current industrial safety standards and are designed to protect personnel health while maintaining operational efficiency.

All manufacturing personnel are required to familiarize themselves with these procedures and implement them during all phases of solvent handling operations. Supervisory staff shall ensure compliance with these protocols and maintain documentation of safety training completion for all personnel under their supervision.

## 2. SCOPE OF APPLICATION

These guidelines apply to all industrial solvents currently utilized in Cryovac manufacturing processes, including but not limited to:

- Trichloroethylene (TCE) - Primary degreasing solvent
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) - Precision cleaning applications  
- Methylene chloride - Paint stripping and adhesive removal
- Carbon tetrachloride - Metal cleaning operations
- Benzene compounds - Rubber cement and adhesive formulations
- Toluene - Coating thinners and cleaning solutions

## 3. PERSONNEL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Personal Protective Equipment

All personnel handling industrial solvents must wear appropriate protective equipment:

- **Rubber gloves** - Neoprene or natural rubber, minimum 8-mil thickness
- **Safety goggles** - Chemical splash protection, side shields required
- **Protective aprons** - Rubber or chemical-resistant material
- **Respiratory protection** - Cotton masks for light exposure, respirators for enclosed operations

### 3.2 Health Monitoring

Personnel regularly exposed to solvent vapors should report any of the following symptoms to supervisory staff:

- Persistent headaches or dizziness
- Nausea or stomach irritation
- Skin rashes or irritation
- Unusual fatigue or weakness
- Respiratory difficulties

**Note:** While current medical understanding suggests these solvents pose minimal long-term health risks when properly handled, immediate symptoms indicate overexposure requiring corrective action.

### 3.3 Training Requirements

All new personnel must complete solvent safety orientation within first week of employment. Annual refresher training is required for all manufacturing staff. Training records shall be maintained in personnel files.

## 4. HANDLING AND STORAGE PROCEDURES

### 4.1 Container Management

- Store solvent containers in designated areas away from heat sources
- Maintain containers in upright position with secure closures
- Label all containers clearly with contents and date received
- Inspect containers weekly for leaks or deterioration
- Use grounding straps when transferring flammable solvents

### 4.2 Ventilation Requirements

Manufacturing areas utilizing solvents must maintain adequate air circulation:

- Exhaust fans operational during all solvent operations
- Fresh air intake systems functioning properly
- Vapor concentrations monitored monthly using detection equipment
- Windows and doors kept open when weather permits

### 4.3 Spill Response Procedures

In event of solvent spills:

1. Evacuate immediate area of non-essential personnel
2. Eliminate ignition sources (cigarettes, electrical equipment)
3. Absorb spills using sand or commercial absorbent materials
4. Collect contaminated materials in metal containers
5. Report spills exceeding one gallon to Safety Department

## 5. WASTE DISPOSAL PROTOCOLS

### 5.1 Liquid Waste Management

Used solvents and contaminated liquids shall be managed according to the following procedures:

- Collect waste solvents in designated steel drums
- Store waste containers in outdoor storage area behind Building 3
- Maintain waste inventory logs with quantities and dates
- Schedule disposal through approved waste management contractor

### 5.2 Solid Waste Disposal

Solvent-contaminated rags, filters, and absorbent materials:

- Place in metal containers with tight-fitting lids
- Store containers in ventilated area away from work spaces
- Empty containers weekly to prevent accumulation
- Dispose of contents through industrial waste collection service

### 5.3 Emergency Disposal Procedures

For immediate disposal needs or emergency situations:

- Small quantities (less than 5 gallons) may be discharged to sanitary sewer with adequate water dilution
- Larger quantities require temporary storage pending contractor pickup
- Document all emergency disposals in incident reports

## 6. EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION

### 6.1 Storage Tank Inspection

Monthly inspection of solvent storage tanks shall include:

- Visual examination for corrosion or structural damage
- Testing of valve and fitting integrity
- Verification of secondary containment systems
- Documentation of inspection findings in maintenance logs

### 6.2 Transfer Equipment

Pumps, hoses, and transfer equipment require:

- Weekly inspection for leaks or wear
- Immediate repair or replacement of damaged components
- Proper grounding to prevent static electricity buildup
- Regular cleaning to prevent contamination buildup

## 7. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 7.1 Groundwater Protection

While current scientific understanding indicates minimal environmental risk from proper solvent use, the following precautions shall be observed:

- Avoid discharge of concentrated solvents to ground surfaces
- Maintain adequate separation between storage areas and water wells
- Report any unusual soil discoloration or odors to management
- Conduct annual soil sampling around storage areas as feasible

### 7.2 Air Quality Management

To minimize atmospheric emissions:

- Maintain solvent containers in closed condition when not in active use
- Utilize local exhaust ventilation during transfer operations
- Schedule high-solvent operations during favorable wind conditions
- Monitor for vapor accumulation in low-lying areas

## 8. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Cryovac Inc. maintains compliance with applicable federal and state regulations governing industrial solvent use. Current regulatory framework includes:

- Massachusetts Department of Public Health industrial hygiene standards
- Federal workplace safety guidelines as established by industrial safety organizations
- Local fire prevention codes regarding flammable liquid storage
- Municipal wastewater discharge regulations

## 9. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### 9.1 Fire Emergency

In case of solvent-related fire:

1. Activate fire alarm system
2. Evacuate area using designated emergency routes
3. Contact Woburn Fire Department (WEbster 4-2100)
4. Do not use water on solvent fires - use CO2 or dry chemical extinguishers
5. Provide fire personnel with solvent identification information

### 9.2 Personnel Exposure Emergency

For suspected solvent overexposure:

1. Remove affected person from exposure area immediately
2. Provide fresh air and medical attention as needed
3. Contact company physician (Dr. Robert Mills - WEbster 4-7890)
4. Document incident in safety report within 24 hours
5. Review procedures to prevent recurrence

## 10. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING

### 10.1 Required Records

Manufacturing supervisors shall maintain:

- Daily solvent usage logs
- Weekly safety inspection reports
- Monthly inventory reconciliation documents
- Annual training completion records
- Incident and accident reports as required

### 10.2 Management Reporting

Safety Department requires quarterly reports summarizing:

- Total solvent consumption by type
- Safety incidents and corrective actions taken
- Personnel training status
- Equipment maintenance activities
- Regulatory compliance status
