Dear Mrs. Anderson:

I am writing to express my sincere condolences on the tragic loss of your son James. Having learned of your family's circumstances through colleagues in the legal community who are familiar with the emerging pattern of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn, I believe there may be grounds for legal action that could provide both compensation for your loss and accountability for those responsible for the contamination that may have contributed to James's illness and death.

My name is Charles R. Nesson, and I am a professor at Harvard Law School with extensive experience in complex litigation involving corporate negligence and environmental contamination. Over the past several months, I have been researching the unusual cluster of childhood leukemia cases in your neighborhood, particularly in relation to the municipal water supply from Wells G and H. The preliminary evidence suggests a disturbing pattern of industrial chemical contamination that may have directly impacted the health of children in your community, including your beloved James.

Based on my initial investigation, it appears that several major corporations operating in the vicinity of your neighborhood may have been disposing of toxic industrial solvents in a manner that allowed these chemicals to migrate into the groundwater that supplied Wells G and H. These wells, which opened in 1964 and 1966 respectively, provided water to your home throughout James's entire life. The chemicals of particular concern include trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), both of which are known carcinogens that have been detected in your municipal water supply at levels that pose significant health risks, particularly to developing children.

The companies that warrant investigation include W.R. Grace Company, which operates a chemical processing facility through its Cryovac division, Beatrice Foods, which owns property where chemical disposal may have occurred, and John J. Riley Company, a local tanning operation that has used various industrial solvents in its processes. Each of these entities had the capability and opportunity to dispose of the types of chemicals that have been found in your water supply, and each had a legal and moral obligation to ensure that their waste disposal practices did not endanger the surrounding community.

What makes your case particularly compelling from a legal standpoint is the clear temporal relationship between the opening of Wells G and H and the onset of James's illness. James was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in January 1972, when he was three years old, after having consumed water from these wells throughout his early developmental years—the period when children are most vulnerable to carcinogenic exposure. The fact that multiple children in your immediate neighborhood have developed leukemia, while the broader Woburn community shows no such clustering, strongly suggests a localized environmental cause tied to your specific water source.

I want to be forthright with you about the challenges we would face in pursuing this matter. Environmental tort litigation is complex and expensive, requiring extensive scientific evidence to establish causation between chemical exposure and disease. The defendants we would be facing are well-funded corporations with teams of experienced attorneys who will vigorously contest every aspect of our case. They will argue that leukemia has multiple potential causes, that the science linking TCE and PCE to childhood leukemia is inconclusive, and that any contamination was within acceptable limits or occurred without their knowledge.

However, I believe we have several factors working in our favor. First, the clustering of cases in your specific geographic area creates a compelling epidemiological pattern that would be difficult to explain without environmental causation. Second, recent advances in groundwater hydrology and chemical analysis will allow us to trace the migration of contaminants from their sources to your water supply with unprecedented precision. Third, there is growing scientific literature documenting the carcinogenic properties of the chemicals found in your water, particularly their impact on developing children.

Most importantly, I believe this case represents an opportunity to establish important legal precedents regarding corporate responsibility for environmental contamination and the protection of municipal water supplies. The companies that disposed of these chemicals in a manner that contaminated your community's drinking water must be held accountable for the consequences of their actions. No family should have to endure what you have experienced, and no community should have to live with the fear that their tap water may be slowly poisoning their children.

If you decide to proceed with legal action, I would recommend that we also reach out to other affected families in your neighborhood. Cases involving Kevin Kane Jr., Michael Zona, Patrick Toomey, Carl Robbins III, and Roland Gamache could be consolidated into a single action that would strengthen our position and share the substantial costs of litigation. A coordinated approach would also allow us to present a more comprehensive picture of the contamination's impact on your community.

I should mention that I have been in contact with Jan Schlichtmann, a talented personal injury attorney who has expressed interest in taking on this type of environmental case. Mr. Schlichtmann has the resources and dedication necessary to pursue complex litigation against well-funded corporate defendants, and I believe he would be an excellent choice to serve as lead counsel if you decide to move forward. I would be happy to facilitate an introduction and continue to provide consultation on the legal and scientific aspects of the case.

The statute of limitations for wrongful death claims in Massachusetts is three years from the date of death, which means we have until January 1984 to file suit. However, I strongly recommend that we begin the investigation process immediately, as gathering the necessary evidence will require substantial time and resources. We will need to conduct extensive discovery regarding the defendants' waste disposal practices, analyze groundwater flow patterns, review medical records, and consult with experts in toxicology, epidemiology, and environmental engineering.

I want to emphasize that pursuing this litigation will not bring James back, nor will it ease the profound grief you must be experiencing. What it can do is ensure that those responsible for contaminating your community's water supply are held accountable for their actions, provide financial compensation that may help with medical expenses and other losses, and potentially prevent similar tragedies from occurring in other communities. Sometimes the pursuit of justice is the only way to give meaning to an otherwise senseless loss.

Please know that if you choose to proceed, you will have my full support and that of my colleagues at Harvard Law School. We have access to some of the nation's leading experts in environmental science and public health, and we are committed to using every available resource to build the strongest possible case. This litigation will likely take several years to resolve and will require tremendous perseverance, but I believe the evidence will ultimately demonstrate that your family and your community have been the victims of corporate negligence that demands accountability.

I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you in person to discuss this matter further and answer any questions you may have. Please feel free to contact me at my office at (617) 495-4621, or I can arrange to visit you at your home at your convenience. I understand that this is an incredibly difficult time for you and your family, and I want to ensure that you have all the information necessary to make an informed decision about how to proceed.

Again, please accept my deepest condolences for your loss. James's life, though tragically brief, has the potential to serve as a catalyst for important changes in how our society addresses environmental contamination and corporate responsibility. I hope you will consider allowing his memory to be honored through the pursuit of justice for your family and your community.

Sincerely,
