# CITY OF WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## Daily Water Demand and Production Report - East Woburn District

**TO:** Water Department Management  
**FROM:** Robert F. McCarthy, City Water Operator  
**DATE:** November 7, 1966  
**RE:** Daily Production Summary and System Operations

### Production Summary - November 6, 1966

**Well G Operations:**
- Daily production: 847,000 gallons
- Operating hours: 18.5 hours
- Average flow rate: 760 gallons per minute
- Pump motor temperature: Normal range (142-156°F)
- System pressure maintained: 65-72 PSI

**Well H Operations:**
- Daily production: 623,000 gallons  
- Operating hours: 14.2 hours
- Average flow rate: 730 gallons per minute
- Pump motor temperature: Normal range (138-151°F)
- System pressure maintained: 68-75 PSI

**Total East Woburn District Production:** 1,470,000 gallons

### Demand Analysis

Peak demand occurred between 6:30-8:00 AM at 1,240 gallons per minute, coinciding with morning residential usage patterns. Secondary peak observed from 5:45-7:15 PM at 1,180 gallons per minute. Both wells operated simultaneously during peak periods to maintain adequate system pressure throughout the East Woburn distribution network.

Residential demand remains consistent with seasonal patterns, showing the expected November decline from summer highs. Industrial customers including facilities along New Boston Street and Olympia Avenue maintained steady consumption rates. The Cryovac plant reported normal water usage of approximately 45,000 gallons for their Monday shift operations.

### Water Quality Observations

**Well G:** Water clarity excellent. No unusual taste or odor complaints received from East Woburn residents served by this well. Chlorine residual maintained at 0.4-0.6 ppm throughout distribution system. Sample collected at 10:15 AM for routine bacteriological testing - results pending from state laboratory.

**Well H:** Water clarity good. Slight metallic taste noted during morning inspection, though within acceptable parameters based on previous testing. Chlorine residual maintained at 0.3-0.5 ppm. No customer complaints received regarding taste or odor. Sample collected at 10:30 AM for routine analysis.

Both wells continue to show the characteristic slight discoloration that has been present since Well H came online in August. This appears to be related to natural iron content in the aquifer and remains within state guidelines. The discoloration is most noticeable during initial draw periods and clears after several minutes of flow.

### System Maintenance and Operations

**Equipment Status:**
- Well G pump motor: Operating normally, last serviced October 12, 1966
- Well H pump motor: Operating normally, minor vibration noted but within tolerance
- Distribution pumps: All three units operational
- Chlorination equipment: Both wells - functioning properly

**Infrastructure Notes:**
- Main line pressure test completed on Olympia Avenue section - all readings normal
- Minor leak repair completed at intersection of Salem Street and Montvale Avenue
- Hydrant flushing scheduled for Pine Street area November 8-9

### Regulatory Compliance

All operations conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines. Monthly bacteriological samples submitted to state laboratory on November 1st - results pending. Chlorine residual logs maintained and available for inspection. Well G and Well H continue to meet all current state standards for municipal water supply.

### Customer Relations

No service complaints received during reporting period. Two routine inquiries regarding water pressure on Forest Street - both resolved through standard system adjustments. Billing department reports normal collection rates for East Woburn district customers.

### Recommendations

1. **Continued Monitoring:** Maintain current sampling schedule for both wells. The slight taste variations in Well H water, while within acceptable limits, should continue to be monitored closely.

2. **Equipment Maintenance:** Schedule routine maintenance for Well H pump motor to address minor vibration issue noted above. Recommend inspection within next 30 days.

3. **Capacity Planning:** Current production levels are meeting demand adequately. However, continued residential development in the East Woburn area may require increased capacity planning for 1967 operations.

4. **Quality Assurance:** Continue routine sampling and maintain detailed logs of any taste, odor, or appearance variations. While current parameters meet all regulatory requirements, consistent documentation supports our commitment to providing safe, reliable water service to East Woburn residents.

### Next Reporting Period

Will continue daily monitoring of both wells and maintain production logs. Special attention to be paid to any changes in water characteristics as we enter the winter operating season. November 8th inspection will include detailed review of all pumping equipment and distribution system components.
