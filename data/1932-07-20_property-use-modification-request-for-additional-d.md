## REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION

The John J. Riley Company hereby respectfully petitions the Woburn Local Planning Commission for modification of existing land use permits to allow for the expansion of waste disposal operations on the property located at 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts, as more particularly described in the attached survey plat dated June 15, 1932.

**WHEREAS,** the John J. Riley Company has operated a leather tanning facility at the aforementioned location since 1909 in good standing with all applicable municipal regulations then in effect; and

**WHEREAS,** the Company's operations have expanded significantly over the past twenty-three years to meet increasing demand for processed leather goods throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and neighboring states; and

**WHEREAS,** current waste disposal capacity on the existing permitted areas has proven insufficient to accommodate the volume of tanning waste, chemical residues, and processing by-products generated by expanded operations; and

**WHEREAS,** the Company seeks to continue its operations in a manner consistent with sound business practices while maintaining its commitment to the economic development of East Woburn;

**NOW THEREFORE,** the John J. Riley Company requests permission to utilize an additional 2.3 acres of land on the western portion of the property, adjacent to the railroad tracks, for the disposal of tanning wastes, spent chemicals, and other manufacturing by-products.

---

## DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS

### Current Disposal Operations

The Riley tannery currently maintains waste disposal operations on approximately 1.7 acres of the total 8.2-acre property. These operations consist of:

1. **Chemical Waste Ponds:** Two excavated ponds measuring approximately 40 feet by 60 feet each, utilized for the disposal of spent tanning solutions containing chromium sulfate, sodium sulfide, and various organic compounds essential to the leather processing operation.

2. **Solid Waste Area:** A designated area of approximately 0.8 acres for the disposal of hair, flesh, and other organic materials removed during the hide preparation process.

3. **Sludge Drying Beds:** Three concrete-lined beds for the dewatering of treatment sludge prior to final disposal.

### Proposed Expansion

The Company proposes to expand disposal operations to include the western 2.3 acres of the property, which would accommodate:

1. **Additional Chemical Storage and Disposal Area:** Construction of three additional waste ponds, each measuring 50 feet by 80 feet, to handle increased volumes of spent tanning chemicals and process water.

2. **Expanded Solid Waste Disposal:** Designation of 1.2 acres for the burial of solid tanning wastes, including hide trimmings, defleshing waste, and spent tan bark.

3. **Chemical Drum Storage:** A secure area for the temporary storage of chemical containers and drums pending proper disposal or return to suppliers.

### Justification for Expansion

The leather tanning industry requires the use of various chemical compounds to transform raw hides into finished leather products. The Company's operations necessarily generate waste materials that must be disposed of in a responsible manner. The proposed expansion would allow the Company to:

- **Maintain Production Levels:** Continue meeting customer demand without interruption due to inadequate waste disposal capacity.

- **Improve Operational Efficiency:** Consolidate waste disposal operations on Company property rather than relying on costly transportation to distant disposal sites.

- **Support Local Employment:** Preserve jobs for the forty-three workers currently employed at the facility, contributing to the economic stability of East Woburn.

- **Enhance Safety:** Provide adequate space for proper segregation and handling of different waste types, reducing potential hazards to workers and the surrounding community.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The Company acknowledges the importance of protecting the local environment and has taken measures to ensure responsible waste management practices. The proposed disposal areas have been selected based on the following considerations:

### Soil Conditions

Geological surveys conducted in 1931 indicate that the western portion of the property consists primarily of clay and sandy loam soils with good absorption characteristics. These soil conditions are well-suited for the containment of liquid wastes and provide natural filtration of potentially harmful substances before they could reach underlying water sources.

### Water Resources

The proposed expansion area is located at a safe distance from the Aberjona River, with natural topography directing surface water flow away from the river system. The Company has consulted with local well owners in the vicinity and determined that no private wells are located within 500 feet of the proposed disposal area.

### Prevailing Winds and Odor Control

The western location of the expanded disposal area takes advantage of prevailing easterly winds, which will carry any odors away from residential areas and toward the less populated industrial corridor along the railroad tracks.

---

## COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS

The John J. Riley Company commits to operating the expanded disposal area in full compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations, including:

1. **Municipal Health Codes:** All waste disposal activities will be conducted in accordance with Woburn Board of Health regulations regarding industrial waste management.

2. **State Environmental Standards:** The Company will comply with all Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines for industrial waste disposal and groundwater protection.

3. **Fire Safety Requirements:** Storage and disposal of flammable materials will conform to Massachusetts Fire Prevention Code standards.

4. **Worker Safety:** All disposal operations will be conducted with appropriate safety measures to protect Company employees and contractors.

---

## ECONOMIC IMPACT

The requested modification will enable the John J. Riley Company to continue its vital contribution to the local economy. The tannery currently:

- **Employs 43 local residents** with an annual payroll of approximately $32,400
- **Purchases raw materials** from local suppliers totaling $18,600 annually
- **Contributes property taxes** of $1,240 per year to the City of Woburn
- **Supports secondary employment** through suppliers, contractors, and service providers

Approval of this modification will ensure the continuation of these economic benefits while allowing for potential future growth of the operation.

---

## CONCLUSION

The John J. Riley Company respectfully submits this application for modification of existing land use permits to accommodate necessary expansion of waste disposal operations. The Company has operated responsibly in East Woburn for twenty-three years and seeks to continue contributing to the community's economic prosperity while maintaining appropriate environmental stewardship.

The proposed modifications represent a reasonable and necessary expansion of existing operations that will benefit both the Company and the broader Woburn community. We respectfully request the Planning Commission's favorable consideration of this application and stand ready to provide any additional information that may be required.
