Dear Mr. and Mrs. Kane,

I am writing to provide you with a comprehensive summary of Kevin Jr.'s treatment course and to discuss the ongoing medical care recommendations following his recent discharge from our pediatric hematology-oncology unit. As we discussed during our final consultation on June 12th, Kevin's case represents one of the most challenging pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia presentations we have encountered this year, particularly given the aggressive nature of his initial presentation and the complex treatment protocol required to achieve remission.

Kevin was first admitted to Boston Children's Hospital on September 14, 1979, presenting with a constellation of symptoms that had developed over the preceding six weeks. His parents had initially noted persistent fatigue, recurring fevers reaching 102°F, and unusual bruising on his arms and legs that appeared without apparent trauma. The pediatrician in Woburn had initially attributed these symptoms to a viral infection, but when Kevin developed severe nosebleeds and his energy levels continued to decline dramatically, immediate referral to our facility became necessary. Upon admission, Kevin's complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 47,000 per cubic millimeter (normal range 4,500-13,500), with 78% blast cells present in the peripheral blood smear—findings consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The initial bone marrow biopsy performed on September 16, 1979, confirmed our clinical suspicions, showing hypercellular marrow with 89% lymphoblasts. Cytochemical staining and immunophenotyping studies classified Kevin's leukemia as common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (c-ALL), which typically carries a more favorable prognosis than other subtypes. However, Kevin's presentation was complicated by several high-risk features, including his elevated initial white blood cell count, hepatosplenomegaly noted on physical examination, and evidence of central nervous system involvement suggested by headaches and subtle neurological changes. These factors necessitated an intensified treatment protocol combining vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, and intrathecal methotrexate during the induction phase.

Kevin's response to the initial induction chemotherapy was slower than we typically observe in pediatric ALL cases. While most children achieve blast clearance from peripheral blood within the first week of treatment, Kevin required nearly three weeks to show significant reduction in circulating leukemic cells. The bone marrow biopsy performed on October 8, 1979, showed persistence of 15% blast cells, requiring modification of the treatment protocol to include daunorubicin—an anthracycline antibiotic with significant cardiac toxicity risks that we monitor carefully through serial echocardiograms. This intensification ultimately proved successful, and Kevin achieved morphologic remission by November 2, 1979, with blast cells reduced to less than 5% in bone marrow examination.

The consolidation and maintenance phases of Kevin's treatment have proceeded according to our modified protocol, though he has experienced more frequent episodes of treatment-related complications than we typically observe. Kevin has required four hospitalizations for febrile neutropenia, including two episodes complicated by documented bacterial infections requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy. His absolute neutrophil counts have consistently remained in the severe neutropenia range (less than 500 cells per cubic millimeter) for prolonged periods, necessitating dose modifications of his maintenance chemotherapy regimen. Additionally, Kevin has experienced significant gastrointestinal toxicity, including mucositis requiring nutritional support and two episodes of severe diarrhea leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

During our recent discussions, you have inquired about potential environmental factors that might have contributed to Kevin's leukemia development. While the exact etiology of childhood leukemia remains largely unknown, recent epidemiological studies have suggested possible associations between certain chemical exposures and increased leukemia risk in children. I am aware of the ongoing concerns regarding water quality in the East Woburn area, particularly the closure of municipal Wells G and H in May 1979 due to chemical contamination. Several families from your neighborhood have contacted our department with similar concerns, and we are currently reviewing the medical records of pediatric leukemia cases from the Woburn area to assess any potential clustering patterns.

The scientific literature contains emerging evidence suggesting that exposure to certain organic solvents, including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, may increase the risk of hematologic malignancies in children. These chemicals have been detected in groundwater supplies in various communities across Massachusetts, and their potential carcinogenic properties are currently under investigation by federal health authorities. While we cannot definitively establish causation in Kevin's specific case, the temporal relationship between his residence in East Woburn, his family's use of municipal water from Wells G and H during the period of documented contamination, and his subsequent leukemia diagnosis warrants careful documentation and consideration.

Kevin's current treatment plan involves continuation of maintenance chemotherapy for a total treatment duration of 30 months from the date of initial remission achievement. His current regimen includes daily 6-mercaptopurine, weekly methotrexate, and monthly vincristine with prednisone pulses. We will continue monthly complete blood counts, quarterly bone marrow examinations, and semi-annual lumbar punctures for intrathecal chemotherapy administration. His next scheduled bone marrow biopsy is planned for August 15, 1980, and I anticipate continued morphologic remission based on his recent laboratory studies.

The long-term prognosis for children with Kevin's type of leukemia has improved significantly over the past decade, with current treatment protocols achieving cure rates exceeding 60% in pediatric patients. However, Kevin's initial high-risk presentation and prolonged time to remission place him in a category requiring particularly vigilant follow-up care. We will monitor closely for any signs of relapse, including regular physical examinations, laboratory studies, and imaging studies as clinically indicated. Additionally, we will continue surveillance for potential late effects of chemotherapy, including cardiac function monitoring, growth and development assessment, and neuropsychological evaluation.

I want to emphasize the importance of maintaining Kevin's current treatment schedule and attending all scheduled follow-up appointments. Any interruption in his maintenance chemotherapy could potentially compromise his long-term outcome. Please contact our department immediately if Kevin develops fever above 100.4°F, unusual bruising or bleeding, persistent fatigue, or any other concerning symptoms. Our on-call physician is available 24 hours a day through the hospital operator at (617) 735-6000.

I have enclosed copies of Kevin's complete medical records, including all laboratory studies, pathology reports, and treatment summaries, for your personal files. These documents may be important for future medical care or for any legal consultations you may choose to pursue regarding potential environmental exposures. I have also provided a letter summarizing Kevin's diagnosis, treatment, and current status that you may share with other healthcare providers as needed.

Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you have any questions about Kevin's ongoing care or if you would like to discuss any aspects of his treatment in greater detail. I remain committed to providing Kevin with the highest quality medical care and supporting your family through this challenging period.

Sincerely,
