# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Woburn City Council  
**FROM:** Frank J. Morrison, Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** June 23, 1966  
**RE:** Municipal Water Supply Capacity Enhancement Status Report

## Executive Summary

I am pleased to report on the current status of our municipal water supply capacity enhancement program, which has successfully expanded our ability to serve Woburn's growing population of approximately 35,000 residents. The implementation of Wells G and H has significantly increased our daily production capacity and provides essential redundancy during peak demand periods.

## Well G Operations Status

Well G, which commenced operations in 1964, continues to perform within expected parameters. The well, drilled to 88 feet depth in the eastern aquifer system, has maintained consistent output averaging 400 gallons per minute during normal operations. This facility primarily serves the East Woburn residential area, including neighborhoods east of Main Street (Route 38), and has proven particularly valuable during summer peak demand periods.

Regular maintenance protocols have been established, including quarterly pump inspections and semi-annual water quality testing as required by state health department regulations. The well head facility has been properly secured and marked in accordance with Department of Public Works standards. Monthly production records indicate steady performance with no significant mechanical issues requiring major repairs.

## Well H Development Progress

Construction of Well H has proceeded on schedule following approval by the City Council in late 1965. The drilling contractor, Layne-New York Company, completed the bore to 103 feet depth in March of this year. Initial pump tests conducted in April demonstrated excellent yield capacity of approximately 500 gallons per minute, exceeding our projected requirements.

Installation of the main pumping equipment and electrical systems was completed in May. The distribution main connecting Well H to our primary transmission system has been installed and pressure tested. We anticipate bringing Well H online for regular service by the end of July, pending final inspections by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

## System Integration and Distribution

The integration of Wells G and H into our existing distribution network has required upgrades to several transmission mains in the eastern section of the city. These improvements will enhance water pressure and flow capacity for residents in areas that previously experienced reduced pressure during peak usage periods.

Our engineering consultants, Whitman & Howard, have completed hydraulic modeling of the expanded system and confirm that the additional capacity will adequately serve projected population growth through 1975. The combined output of both wells provides approximately 1.3 million gallons per day of additional capacity to our system.

## Water Quality Monitoring

Routine water quality monitoring continues in accordance with state regulations. Monthly bacteriological testing of samples from Wells G and H has consistently shown compliance with drinking water standards. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has conducted its annual inspection and found all facilities in satisfactory condition.

We have implemented a comprehensive sampling protocol that includes testing at the wellhead, in the distribution system, and at representative residential locations. This monitoring program ensures early detection of any potential issues and maintains our commitment to providing safe, potable water to all residents.

## Financial Summary

The total capital investment for the well development program has remained within the approved budget of $285,000. Well G construction costs were $95,000, while Well H development has required $125,000 through completion. Additional expenses for distribution system improvements and equipment total $65,000.

Operating costs for the expanded system are projected at $18,000 annually, including electricity, maintenance, and required testing. These costs will be offset by increased water revenue from improved service capacity and reduced need for emergency water purchases during peak periods.

## Future Recommendations

Based on current population growth trends and industrial development in the area, I recommend that the City Council consider authorization for preliminary engineering studies for a third well facility by 1968. The Aberjona River watershed contains adequate groundwater resources to support additional development, and early planning will ensure continued reliable service.

I also recommend establishment of a capital reserve fund for water system improvements to address ongoing maintenance needs and regulatory requirements. The state legislature is considering new drinking water standards that may require system modifications in the coming years.

## Conclusion

The municipal water supply enhancement program has successfully increased our system capacity and reliability. Wells G and H represent significant infrastructure investments that will serve our community's needs for years to come. I am confident that these facilities will continue to provide high-quality water service to all residents of Woburn.

I welcome any questions from Council members regarding this report and remain available to provide additional technical details as needed.

Respectfully submitted,

Frank J. Morrison
