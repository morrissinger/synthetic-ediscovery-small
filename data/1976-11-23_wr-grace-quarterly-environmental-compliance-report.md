# W.R. GRACE COMPANY
## QUARTERLY ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE REPORT
### Fourth Quarter 1976

**TO:** Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection  
**FROM:** Robert C. Harrison, Operations Manager  
**DATE:** November 23, 1976  
**RE:** Q4 1976 Environmental Compliance Status - Woburn Facility

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

W.R. Grace Company herewith submits its quarterly environmental compliance report for the fourth quarter of 1976, covering operations at our Woburn manufacturing facility located at 25 Olympia Avenue. This report addresses air emissions, water discharge, and waste management activities in accordance with Massachusetts Environmental Protection regulations and our operating permits issued under Chapter 21 of the Massachusetts General Laws.

During Q4 1976, our facility maintained continuous operations in support of specialty chemical manufacturing, with particular focus on our expanding solvent recovery operations and chemical processing activities. All monitoring requirements have been met, and operational parameters have remained within established guidelines as outlined in our environmental management protocols.

## FACILITY OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

The Woburn facility operates under Massachusetts Air Pollution Control permit AP-76-142 and Water Discharge permit WD-76-089, both issued in early 1976. Our primary manufacturing processes during Q4 included:

- **Chemical Processing Unit A**: Solvent purification and recovery operations
- **Chemical Processing Unit B**: Specialty chemical synthesis
- **Waste Treatment System**: On-site treatment of process wastewater
- **Storage and Handling**: Raw materials and finished product storage

Total production volume for Q4 2016 reached 2,847 tons of processed chemicals, representing a 12% increase over Q3 1976 levels. This increase reflects growing market demand for our specialty solvents and chemical intermediates, particularly trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) products used in industrial degreasing applications.

## AIR EMISSIONS MONITORING

### Stack Emissions Testing

Quarterly stack testing was conducted on October 15, 1976, by certified environmental consultant Northeastern Environmental Services. Testing protocols followed EPA Method 5 procedures for particulate matter and Method 25 for volatile organic compounds. Results demonstrated compliance with all applicable emission limits:

- **Particulate Matter**: 0.08 grains per dry standard cubic foot (limit: 0.10)
- **Volatile Organic Compounds**: 42 pounds per hour (limit: 50 pounds per hour)
- **Sulfur Dioxide**: Below detectable limits
- **Nitrogen Oxides**: 15 parts per million (limit: 25 parts per million)

### Fugitive Emissions Control

Our facility maintains an active fugitive emissions monitoring program, with monthly leak detection and repair activities conducted by plant maintenance personnel. During Q4 1976, routine monitoring identified and repaired 8 minor equipment leaks, primarily involving valve stem packing and flange connections. All repairs were completed within the required 15-day timeframe.

## WATER DISCHARGE COMPLIANCE

### Effluent Monitoring Results

Monthly effluent sampling was conducted at monitoring point WMP-1, located at our discharge outfall to the Aberjona River. All samples were analyzed by certified laboratory Boston Analytical Services using EPA-approved methodologies. Q4 1976 monitoring results were as follows:

**October 1976:**
- pH: 7.2 (range: 6.0-8.5)
- Total Suspended Solids: 18 mg/L (limit: 30 mg/L)
- Biochemical Oxygen Demand: 12 mg/L (limit: 25 mg/L)
- Oil and Grease: 8 mg/L (limit: 15 mg/L)

**November 1976:**
- pH: 6.8 (range: 6.0-8.5)
- Total Suspended Solids: 22 mg/L (limit: 30 mg/L)
- Biochemical Oxygen Demand: 16 mg/L (limit: 25 mg/L)
- Oil and Grease: 11 mg/L (limit: 15 mg/L)

All monitored parameters remained well within permitted discharge limits throughout the reporting period. Our on-site wastewater treatment system, upgraded in 1975, continues to provide effective treatment of process wastewater prior to discharge.

## WASTE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

### Solid Waste Disposal

During Q4 1976, our facility generated approximately 145 tons of solid waste materials, consisting primarily of spent filter media, contaminated packaging materials, and process residues. Waste disposal activities were conducted in accordance with our approved waste management plan:

- **Municipal Solid Waste**: 89 tons disposed at Woburn Municipal Landfill
- **Industrial Waste**: 56 tons disposed at approved industrial waste facility in Framingham

All waste manifests and disposal records are maintained on-site and available for regulatory inspection. Waste characterization testing conducted in September 1976 confirmed that all disposed materials met applicable waste classification criteria.

### Chemical Waste Handling

Process chemicals and solvents are managed through our established chemical inventory system. Waste solvents are collected in designated storage areas and periodically removed by licensed waste hauler Industrial Waste Services of Boston. During Q4 1976, approximately 2,800 gallons of waste solvents were properly disposed through this program.

Temporary storage of waste chemicals occurs in our permitted storage building, which features secondary containment systems and appropriate ventilation controls. Storage capacity utilization averaged 65% during the reporting period, well below the 80% maximum specified in our operating procedures.

## GROUNDWATER MONITORING PROGRAM

In response to Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection guidance issued in 1976, W.R. Grace has initiated a voluntary groundwater monitoring program at our Woburn facility. Three monitoring wells were installed in September 1976 by certified well driller Northeast Water Systems:

- **MW-1**: Upgradient monitoring well, 45 feet deep
- **MW-2**: Downgradient monitoring well, 38 feet deep  
- **MW-3**: Downgradient monitoring well, 42 feet deep

Initial groundwater sampling was conducted in October 1976, with samples analyzed for general chemistry parameters including pH, total dissolved solids, and chloride content. Baseline data collection will continue through Q1 1977 to establish natural groundwater quality conditions in the vicinity of our facility.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

### Permit Compliance

W.R. Grace maintains current environmental permits for all regulated activities at the Woburn facility. Permit compliance during Q4 1976 was as follows:

- **Air Pollution Control Permit AP-76-142**: In compliance
- **Water Discharge Permit WD-76-089**: In compliance
- **Waste Storage Permit WS-76-034**: In compliance

No permit violations or enforcement actions occurred during the reporting period. All required monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations were fulfilled in accordance with permit conditions and regulatory requirements.

### Regulatory Communications

During Q4 1976, W.R. Grace received one routine inspection visit from Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection personnel on November 8, 1976. The inspection covered air emissions control equipment, wastewater treatment operations, and waste storage areas. No deficiencies were identified, and the inspection was concluded without issuance of any notices or corrective action requirements.

## ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS

### Process Optimization

W.R. Grace continues to implement process improvements designed to minimize environmental impacts while maintaining operational efficiency. Q4 1976 improvements included:

- Installation of enhanced vapor recovery system on solvent storage tanks
- Upgrade of wastewater treatment system chemical feed controls
- Implementation of improved spill prevention procedures in chemical handling areas

These improvements reflect our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship and regulatory compliance in our manufacturing operations.

### Employee Training

Environmental compliance training was provided to all facility personnel during Q4 1976, covering topics including:

- Proper chemical handling and storage procedures
- Emergency spill response protocols
- Waste classification and disposal requirements
- Air emissions control equipment operation

Training records are maintained by our Safety and Environmental Department and are available for regulatory review upon request.

## CONCLUSION AND FORWARD OUTLOOK

W.R. Grace Company's Woburn facility maintained full environmental compliance during Q4 1976, with all monitoring results demonstrating conformance with applicable regulatory requirements. Our comprehensive environmental management program ensures continued protection of air and water quality while supporting
