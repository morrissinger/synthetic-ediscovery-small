## CHIEF COMPLAINT

Patient presents with persistent fatigue, recurring fever, and unexplained bruising over the past six weeks, as reported by parents during initial pediatric consultation on January 18, 1980.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Roland is an 11-year-old male who was referred to oncology following abnormal complete blood count results obtained during routine evaluation for persistent symptoms. Parents report that Roland began experiencing unusual fatigue in mid-December 1979, initially attributed to winter illness and increased school activities. However, symptoms progressively worsened despite adequate rest and supportive care.

The patient's mother, Mrs. Catherine Gamache, reports that Roland has been experiencing recurrent low-grade fevers (99.5-101.2°F) occurring 3-4 times weekly since early January. She notes that Roland, previously an active child who enjoyed outdoor activities and neighborhood games, has become increasingly lethargic and disinterested in normal childhood pursuits. School attendance has become irregular due to frequent complaints of feeling "too tired" and occasional episodes of dizziness.

Of particular concern to the family are multiple bruises appearing on Roland's arms and legs without corresponding trauma or rough play. Mrs. Gamache states these bruises appear "out of nowhere" and take longer than usual to resolve. She has also observed increased pallor, particularly noticeable around Roland's eyes and lips.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

Roland's medical history is notable for generally good health until the onset of current symptoms. Birth history reveals normal full-term delivery with no complications. Childhood immunizations are current per Massachusetts Department of Public Health requirements. No previous hospitalizations or significant illnesses requiring specialty care.

The family resides at 47 Pine Street in East Woburn, approximately 0.8 miles from municipal Wells G and H. The residence has been supplied by city water since the family moved to the address in 1973. Mrs. Gamache reports no known exposures to unusual chemicals or toxins in the home environment.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

**Vital Signs:**
- Temperature: 99.8°F
- Pulse: 110 beats per minute
- Respirations: 24 per minute
- Blood Pressure: 95/60 mmHg
- Weight: 68 pounds (down from 73 pounds at last routine visit in September 1979)

**General Appearance:** Roland appears pale and somewhat lethargic but is alert and cooperative during examination. Notable weight loss since last documented visit.

**HEENT:** Pale conjunctiva and mucous membranes. No lymphadenopathy palpable in neck region. Oral examination reveals pale gums with no obvious lesions.

**Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm with mild tachycardia. No murmurs detected.

**Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No respiratory distress noted.

**Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender. Spleen palpable 2 cm below left costal margin. Liver edge palpable at right costal margin.

**Extremities:** Multiple ecchymoses noted on both arms and legs in various stages of healing. No joint swelling or deformity observed.

**Skin:** Generalized pallor. Multiple bruises as described above, ranging from fresh (dark purple) to resolving (yellow-green discoloration).

## LABORATORY RESULTS

**Complete Blood Count (January 28, 1980):**
- White Blood Cell Count: 2,100/μL (Normal: 4,500-11,000)
- Hemoglobin: 6.8 g/dL (Normal: 11.5-14.5)
- Hematocrit: 20.1% (Normal: 34-42)
- Platelet Count: 45,000/μL (Normal: 150,000-400,000)

**Peripheral Blood Smear:** Significant findings include presence of immature white blood cells (blasts) comprising approximately 35% of total white cell population. Red blood cells show hypochromic, microcytic appearance consistent with anemia.

**Chemistry Panel:** Within normal limits except for elevated LDH at 485 U/L (Normal: 100-250).

## BONE MARROW ASPIRATION AND BIOPSY

Procedure performed February 1, 1980, under local anesthesia with conscious sedation. Sample obtained from posterior iliac crest.

**Findings:** Bone marrow is hypercellular with 78% blast cells. Morphologic features and cytochemical staining patterns consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased.

## DIAGNOSIS

**Primary Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), newly diagnosed

**Secondary Diagnoses:**
- Severe anemia secondary to leukemia
- Thrombocytopenia secondary to leukemia
- Neutropenia secondary to leukemia

## CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND PROGNOSIS

Roland presents with classic signs and symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, confirmed by bone marrow examination. The diagnosis explains his constellation of symptoms including fatigue, recurrent fever, easy bruising, and laboratory abnormalities.

ALL is the most common form of childhood leukemia, representing approximately 75% of pediatric leukemia cases. With appropriate treatment protocols currently available, including combination chemotherapy regimens, the prognosis for childhood ALL has improved significantly over the past decade. Current treatment protocols show remission rates of 70-80% in pediatric patients.

However, the treatment process will be lengthy and intensive, requiring hospitalization for initial induction therapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy over approximately 24-30 months. The patient and family should be prepared for significant lifestyle adjustments and potential treatment-related complications.

## TREATMENT PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate hospitalization** for initiation of induction chemotherapy protocol per current Pediatric Oncology Group standards

2. **Induction Protocol:** Four-drug combination including:
   - Vincristine
   - Prednisone  
   - L-asparaginase
   - Daunorubicin

3. **Supportive Care:**
   - Blood product transfusions as needed for anemia and thrombocytopenia
   - Infection precautions given neutropenia
   - Nutritional support and monitoring

4. **Family Education and Support:**
   - Comprehensive discussion of diagnosis, treatment plan, and prognosis
   - Social work consultation for family support services
   - Educational coordination with school district for continued learning during treatment

5. **Follow-up Care:**
   - Daily monitoring during hospitalization
   - Regular bone marrow evaluations to assess treatment response
   - Long-term follow-up in pediatric oncology clinic

## FAMILY CONFERENCE

A comprehensive family conference was conducted on February 1, 1980, at 4:45 PM with both parents present. The diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was explained in detail, including the nature of the disease, treatment requirements, expected timeline, and potential complications. Both parents demonstrated understanding of the diagnosis and expressed commitment to the recommended treatment plan.

Mrs. Gamache inquired about potential environmental factors that might have contributed to Roland's illness, specifically referencing recent community discussions about water quality in East Woburn. I explained that while the exact causes of childhood leukemia remain largely unknown, research continues into various environmental and genetic factors. I recommended that any specific environmental concerns be discussed with appropriate public health authorities.

The family was provided with written educational materials about childhood leukemia and contact information for support resources including the American Cancer Society and local family support groups.

## DISPOSITION

Roland will be admitted to the pediatric oncology unit today
