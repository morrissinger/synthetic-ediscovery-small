## WORK DESCRIPTION

**Subject:** Disposal of Chromium Solution Storage Drums - Building 3 Chemical Storage Area

**Location:** Chemical storage facility adjacent to main tanning floor operations, Building 3, northeast corner

**Task Details:**

The maintenance crew is hereby directed to remove and dispose of **twelve (12) steel drums** containing spent chromium tanning solutions currently stored in the designated chemical storage area. These drums have been accumulating since November 1974 operations and require immediate removal to make space for incoming chemical deliveries scheduled for March 1975.

**Drum Specifications:**
- Quantity: 12 drums (55-gallon capacity each)
- Contents: Spent chromium sulfate solutions from hide tanning operations
- Estimated total volume: 660 gallons
- Drum condition: Various states - some showing minor rust, others intact
- Identification markings: Red paint markings "CR-SOL" with sequential numbers 1-12

**Disposal Instructions:**

1. **Loading Protocol:** Use standard drum handling equipment to load drums onto company flatbed truck (License MA-4782). Exercise normal industrial handling procedures. Crew should wear standard work gloves and coveralls as per company policy.

2. **Transportation Route:** Proceed via Salem Street to Route 38 North, then to the **Aberjona River access point** approximately 0.8 miles north of the Mishawum Station area. Utilize the established industrial waste disposal location that has served company operations since 1968.

3. **Disposal Method:** Empty drum contents into the designated disposal area adjacent to the river access point. This location has been used consistently for similar chemical waste disposal from our tanning operations without incident. The natural water flow provides adequate dilution of industrial effluents.

4. **Drum Handling:** After emptying, drums should be rinsed with river water and may be retained for future use or disposed of as scrap metal per crew discretion.

**Special Notes:**

- Weather conditions are favorable for this operation with temperatures above freezing
- River flow levels are adequate for proper waste dilution
- This disposal method aligns with standard industrial practices utilized throughout the Woburn manufacturing district
- No special permits or notifications required - this falls under routine industrial waste management procedures

**Safety Considerations:**

Standard industrial safety protocols apply. Crew members should avoid direct skin contact with drum contents and ensure adequate ventilation during handling operations. In case of spillage during transport, absorb with available sand or dirt and continue with disposal as planned.

**Completion Requirements:**

Upon completion of disposal operations, crew foreman should report back to the main office with confirmation that all twelve drums have been properly emptied and disposed of. No written documentation of disposal location or methods is required - verbal confirmation to management is sufficient.

**Authorization:**

This work order is issued under the authority of standard tanning operation procedures and represents routine maintenance of chemical storage facilities. The disposal location has been utilized for similar operations throughout our company's presence in Woburn and represents the most cost-effective method for managing spent tanning chemicals.

**Resource Allocation:**

- Personnel: 3-man maintenance crew
- Equipment: Flatbed truck, drum handling equipment, standard safety gear
- Estimated time: 4-6 hours including transportation
- Budget impact: Minimal - utilizing existing company resources and established disposal procedures

**Environmental Considerations:**

The selected disposal location provides natural processing of industrial chemicals through soil filtration and water dilution. This method has been successfully employed by multiple Woburn-area manufacturing operations without adverse effects. The proximity to groundwater sources is not considered problematic given the established industrial character of the area and the dilution capacity of natural water systems.

**Follow-up Actions:**

No special follow-up required beyond standard reporting. This disposal operation represents routine industrial waste management consistent with decades of established practice in the Woburn industrial district. Chemical storage area will be cleaned and prepared for incoming material deliveries as scheduled.
