## JUSTIFICATION AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The expansion of Production Line 3 to accommodate increased demand for our vacuum packaging products requires substantial quantities of industrial solvents and cleaning agents. Our current inventory levels are insufficient to support the projected 40% increase in manufacturing capacity scheduled to commence June 1963.

The requested trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene will support our new vapor degreasing system, which represents a significant improvement in our ability to prepare metal components for the precision assembly required in vacuum packaging equipment. The vapor degreasing process ensures complete removal of oils, greases, and particulate matter from critical components, thereby maintaining the high-quality standards our customers expect from Cryovac products.

Methylene chloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane will be utilized in our expanded parts cleaning operations. As we increase production volume, maintaining cleanliness standards becomes increasingly critical to prevent contamination of packaging materials and ensure proper seal integrity in our vacuum packaging systems.

The secondary solvents—acetone and toluene—will support general cleaning operations and adhesive formulation activities associated with the expanded production schedule. These materials are essential for maintaining operational efficiency and product quality during the transition to higher production volumes.

---

## STORAGE AND HANDLING SPECIFICATIONS

All chlorinated solvents will be stored in the designated tank farm area in Building C, utilizing our existing 5,000-gallon capacity steel storage tanks with appropriate secondary containment. The tank farm area features concrete containment berms designed to capture any potential spills or leaks during normal operations.

Flammable materials, specifically acetone, will be stored in approved safety cabinets in Building A, maintaining compliance with local fire safety regulations and company safety protocols. All storage areas will be clearly marked with appropriate hazard warnings and emergency contact information.

Our maintenance staff has been trained in proper handling procedures for these materials, and all storage and dispensing operations will follow established protocols outlined in our Chemical Handling Manual, Revision 3 (February 1963).

---

## DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS

Used solvents and contaminated materials will be collected in designated waste containers and disposed of according to current company procedures. Waste trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene will be stored temporarily in the waste solvent area behind Building C before final disposal arrangements are made.

Our standard practice involves periodic removal of waste solvents by approved contractors for off-site disposal. However, given the increased volume associated with expanded operations, we may need to evaluate additional disposal options to ensure timely removal of waste materials and maintain adequate storage capacity for ongoing operations.

---

## BUDGET AUTHORIZATION

The total estimated cost for these materials is $8,750, which falls within the approved budget allocation for Production Line 3 expansion (Budget Code: PROD-EXP-63-003). Funding has been allocated from the Manufacturing Operations account and approved by the Division Controller.

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Trichloroethylene: $3,200
- Perchloroethylene: $2,880
- Methylene Chloride: $950
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: $1,200
- Acetone: $320
- Toluene: $200
