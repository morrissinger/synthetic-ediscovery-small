# WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEM OPERATIONS REPORT

**TO:** Harold T. Sullivan, City Administrator  
**FROM:** Robert J. MacPherson, Water Department Superintendent  
**DATE:** September 19, 1972  
**RE:** Monthly Operations Report - September 1972

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report provides an overview of water system operations for the month of September 1972, including production statistics, system maintenance activities, and operational status of all municipal water sources. Overall system performance has remained within acceptable parameters, with Wells G and H continuing to provide supplemental capacity during peak demand periods.

## WATER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION

### Monthly Production Summary

Total water production for September 1972 reached 47.2 million gallons, representing a 3.8% increase over August 1972 figures. This increase reflects continued residential development in the eastern sections of the city and higher than average September temperatures requiring increased lawn irrigation.

**Production by Source:**
- Main Street Wells (Wells A, B, C): 28.7 million gallons (60.8%)
- Well G (Olympia Avenue): 11.2 million gallons (23.7%)
- Well H (East Woburn): 7.3 million gallons (15.5%)

Wells G and H operated for a combined total of 18 days during September, primarily during afternoon and evening peak demand periods. Well G operated 12 days, averaging 6.2 hours per operational day. Well H operated 9 days, averaging 5.8 hours per operational day. Both wells demonstrated satisfactory flow rates and pressure maintenance throughout the reporting period.

### Distribution System Performance

The distribution system maintained adequate pressure throughout all service areas, with minimum recorded pressure of 42 PSI in the Pine Street area during peak evening demand on September 14th. No service interruptions occurred during the reporting period, and customer complaints regarding water pressure or availability totaled only three for the month, all resolved within 24 hours.

## SYSTEM MAINTENANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE

### Routine Maintenance Activities

Standard monthly maintenance was completed on all pumping equipment, with particular attention to the newer pumping systems at Wells G and H. Both wells received full electrical system inspections, with all components functioning within specifications. Pump efficiency testing indicated normal performance for both units.

The distribution main replacement project on Main Street between Winn Street and Pleasant Street was completed on September 8th, with new 8-inch cast iron pipe replacing the original 6-inch installation from 1923. This improvement should enhance pressure delivery to the central business district and reduce maintenance requirements in this high-traffic area.

### Equipment Status

All major equipment is operational and in satisfactory condition. The backup generator at Well G received its quarterly load test on September 15th and performed within specifications. Minor bearing replacement was completed on Pump Unit #2 at the Main Street facility, with the unit returned to service on September 12th following a three-day maintenance shutdown.

Water storage tank levels have remained adequate throughout the month, with the Prospect Hill tank maintaining an average level of 78% capacity and the newer East Woburn tank averaging 82% capacity.

## WATER QUALITY MONITORING

### Bacteriological Testing

All required bacteriological samples were collected and analyzed according to state health department protocols. A total of 28 samples were collected from various points throughout the distribution system during September, with all samples testing negative for coliform bacteria. This continues our record of consistent compliance with state bacteriological standards.

### Chemical Analysis

Routine chemical analysis was performed on samples from all active sources. Standard parameters including pH, hardness, iron content, and chloride levels all remained within acceptable ranges established by state health authorities. pH values ranged from 6.8 to 7.4 across all sources, with Wells G and H showing slightly higher alkalinity than the Main Street wells.

Iron content remained low across all sources, with maximum detected levels of 0.18 mg/L at Well G and 0.22 mg/L at Well H, both well below the 0.3 mg/L aesthetic standard. Chloride levels showed seasonal variation typical for this time of year, ranging from 12 mg/L to 28 mg/L across all sources.

## OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Current Issues

The primary operational challenge continues to be the increasing demand from residential development in East Woburn, particularly in the areas served primarily by Wells G and H. Peak demand periods now regularly require operation of both supplemental wells to maintain adequate pressure and supply.

Minor taste and odor complaints have been received from three customers in the East Woburn area during the month. Investigation of these complaints found no identifiable source, and subsequent sampling showed no unusual chemical parameters. These complaints appear to be isolated incidents and may be related to individual service line conditions rather than source water quality.

### Infrastructure Planning

Continued monitoring of demand patterns indicates that additional water source development may be necessary within the next 5-7 years to meet projected growth in the eastern sections of the city. Current supplemental capacity from Wells G and H provides adequate supply for present needs but operates at or near capacity during peak summer periods.

Consideration should be given to upgrading the electrical service at Well H to improve reliability during extended operation periods. The current service, while adequate, shows voltage fluctuations during peak demand periods that could affect long-term equipment performance.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All state and federal water quality requirements have been met during the reporting period. Monthly reports have been submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health as required, and all documentation is current and properly maintained.

The annual water system inspection by state health officials is scheduled for October 15th, 1972. All preparation activities are on schedule, and no compliance issues are anticipated.

## BUDGET AND FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

September operating expenses totaled $8,247, slightly below the monthly budget allocation of $8,500. Lower than expected maintenance costs offset higher electrical expenses related to increased pumping requirements. Year-to-date expenses remain within 2% of budgeted amounts.

The proposed water main extension to serve the new residential development on Forest Street will require a supplemental budget appropriation of approximately $12,000. This project should be considered for inclusion in the 1973 capital improvement program.

## CONCLUSION

Water system operations during September 1972 continued to meet all service requirements and regulatory standards. The system demonstrated adequate capacity to meet current demand levels, though continued growth in East Woburn will require ongoing monitoring and potential capacity expansion in the coming years.

Staff performance has been exemplary, with particular recognition due to maintenance technician William Morrison for his work on the Main Street main replacement project, completed ahead of schedule and under budget.

I remain available to discuss any aspects of this report or to provide additional information as needed.
