# Personal Notes - Chemical Observations
**October 21, 1949**

Been working at Riley's tannery for near on 15 years now, since I was barely out of school. Started keeping these notes after what I seen this past month. Figure somebody ought to write this down, even if it's just me.

## What I Been Noticing

The smell around the back lot has gotten something fierce this fall. Used to be you could walk back there without your eyes watering, but now it's like walking into a wall of fumes. Jimmy Kowalski from the finishing department says it's just the weather keeping the smell down low, but I don't think that's all of it.

Been watching where we dump the waste from the chrome tanning process. Mr. Riley had us dig out that back area deeper this summer - said we needed more room for the sludge and chemicals. Now it's maybe 8 feet deep in some spots, and the sides are all black and oily looking. The stuff we're putting in there ain't just leather scraps no more - it's all kinds of chemical waste from the new processes we started using.

## The Ground Situation

Here's what's got me worried. That pit we been using is maybe 200 yards from where I seen them surveyors walking around last month with their equipment. Asked Pete Sullivan what they was doing, and he said something about the town looking for new water sources. Don't know if that's true, but if it is, they ought to know what's been going on back here.

The ground around the waste area stays wet all the time now, even when we ain't had rain for weeks. It's got this rainbow sheen on top, like oil, but thicker. And the dirt underneath has turned this dark color that don't look natural. When it rains hard, I seen that colored water running off toward the railroad tracks and down toward the river.

## Chemical Smells and Colors

The new chrome solutions we been using since '47 give off these fumes that make your throat burn. Mr. Riley says it's safe as long as we don't breathe too much of it, but some of the fellas been coughing more lately. The waste from that process comes out this bright green color, and when we dump it in the pit, it turns the whole mess a muddy brown-green.

We also been using more of them degreasing solvents for cleaning the equipment. That stuff is clear as water but smells like it could knock you over. Tony Marchetti spilled some on his hand last week and it turned his skin white and made it peel. We dump the used solvent right in with everything else.

## What the Bosses Say

Brought up my concerns to Mr. Riley's son last week when he was checking on the operation. He said the state inspector comes by regular and ain't never said nothing about how we handle the waste. Says we're doing everything the same way every other tannery does it, and there ain't no rules about it anyway.

But I been thinking about my kids playing down by the river, and about the well water at home that sometimes tastes funny. My wife says it's just the old pipes, but I ain't so sure no more.

## Recent Changes

This month they started having us mix the chrome waste with some kind of acid before we dump it. Says it helps break it down faster. But what I noticed is that when we do that, the whole mixture gets hot and steams up something awful. The steam has this metallic smell that gets in your clothes and won't wash out.

Also been dumping more of the finishing chemicals - the stuff we use to make the leather soft and waterproof. That's got all kinds of solvents in it. Used to be we'd let it dry out some before disposal, but now we just dump it liquid. Easier that way, but it sure makes the pit fill up faster with liquid waste.

## My Concerns

I keep thinking about what happens to all this stuff when the ground freezes and thaws. Seems like it's got to be going somewhere, and with all that water I been seeing, it's probably going down into the ground. Don't know much about how water moves underground, but I know it's got to go somewhere.

The railroad men been complaining about the smell when they work the tracks behind our place. One of them said the ground feels soft and spongy where it never used to be. Makes me wonder if all our waste is spreading out further than we think.

## What I Think Should Happen

Somebody ought to look into whether this is the right way to be handling all these chemicals. Maybe there's a better place to put them, away from where people might be getting their water. Or maybe we could find a way to use less of the chemicals in the first place.

I ain't no expert, but 15 years of watching this operation tells me something ain't right about the way things been going lately. The old-timers say it used to be just leather scraps and lime water going in the ground. Now it's all kinds of chemical solutions and solvents.

Going to keep writing down what I see. Maybe someday it'll matter to somebody.
