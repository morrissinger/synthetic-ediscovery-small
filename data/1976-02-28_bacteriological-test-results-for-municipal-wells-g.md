## BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION REPORT

**Laboratory Report No.:** WQ-76-0847  
**Date of Report:** February 28, 1976  
**Time:** 2:20 PM  
**Analyst:** Dr. Margaret E. Sullivan, Ph.D.  
**Supervisor:** Robert J. Morrison, Chief Bacteriologist  

### SAMPLE IDENTIFICATION

**Submitted by:** Woburn Water Commission  
**Contact:** Harold F. Peterson, Water Superintendent  
**Address:** 10 Common Street, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801  
**Telephone:** (617) 933-0771  

**Sample Sources:**
- **Well G**: Municipal Production Well, Pine Street Station
- **Well H**: Municipal Production Well, Mishawum Road Station

**Collection Date:** February 25, 1976  
**Collection Time:** Well G - 10:15 AM, Well H - 10:45 AM  
**Collected by:** Thomas R. McKenna, Water Commission Inspector  
**Chain of Custody:** Maintained throughout transport and analysis

### METHODOLOGY

Bacteriological analysis was conducted in accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 14th Edition (1975). All procedures followed Massachusetts Department of Public Health Laboratory Protocol Manual, Section 4.2 (Revised January 1976).

**Tests Performed:**
1. Total Coliform Count (Multiple Tube Fermentation Method)
2. Fecal Coliform Count (Elevated Temperature Test)
3. Standard Plate Count (Pour Plate Method)
4. Presumptive Test for Enterococci

**Quality Control:**
- Sterile blanks processed with each batch
- Positive controls verified using known bacterial standards
- All media prepared according to manufacturer specifications
- Incubation temperatures monitored continuously

### ANALYTICAL RESULTS

#### Well G (Pine Street Station)

**Sample Volume Analyzed:** 100 mL portions  
**Dilutions Tested:** 10⁻¹, 10⁻², 10⁻³

| Parameter | Result | Units | Method | Acceptable Limit |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|------------------|
| Total Coliforms | 4 | MPN/100mL | MTF | <2.2 |
| Fecal Coliforms | <2.2 | MPN/100mL | ETT | <2.2 |
| Standard Plate Count | 180 | CFU/mL | Pour Plate | <500 |
| Enterococci | <2.2 | MPN/100mL | Presumptive | <2.2 |

**pH:** 6.8  
**Temperature at Collection:** 52°F  
**Chlorine Residual:** 0.15 mg/L

#### Well H (Mishawum Road Station)

**Sample Volume Analyzed:** 100 mL portions  
**Dilutions Tested:** 10⁻¹, 10⁻², 10⁻³

| Parameter | Result | Units | Method | Acceptable Limit |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|------------------|
| Total Coliforms | 11 | MPN/100mL | MTF | <2.2 |
| Fecal Coliforms | 2.2 | MPN/100mL | ETT | <2.2 |
| Standard Plate Count | 340 | CFU/mL | Pour Plate | <500 |
| Enterococci | 4 | MPN/100mL | Presumptive | <2.2 |

**pH:** 6.6  
**Temperature at Collection:** 51°F  
**Chlorine Residual:** 0.12 mg/L

### ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION

The bacteriological examination of samples from Wells G and H reveals significant deviations from acceptable water quality standards established under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 111, Section 160 and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.

**Well G** demonstrates total coliform levels of 4 MPN/100mL, which exceeds the maximum allowable concentration of 2.2 MPN/100mL for finished drinking water. While fecal coliform levels remain within acceptable limits, the presence of elevated total coliforms indicates potential contamination pathways that require immediate investigation and remediation.

**Well H** presents more serious contamination concerns, with total coliform levels reaching 11 MPN/100mL—five times the acceptable limit. Additionally, fecal coliform detection at the maximum allowable threshold of 2.2 MPN/100mL suggests possible sewage contamination or surface water infiltration. The presence of enterococci at 4 MPN/100mL further supports this interpretation, as these organisms are typically associated with human and animal waste sources.

Both wells demonstrate pH levels below the recommended range of 7.0-8.5, which may indicate groundwater interaction with industrial discharge or natural acid conditions. The reduced chlorine residual levels observed in both samples suggest either inadequate disinfection or high chlorine demand due to organic contamination.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on these analytical results, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Laboratory recommends the following immediate actions:

1. **Immediate Notification:** The Woburn Water Commission must notify all consumers served by Wells G and H of potential bacterial contamination within 24 hours of receipt of this report, in accordance with Massachusetts Drinking Water Regulations, 310 CMR 22.00.

2. **Increased Disinfection:** Implement enhanced chlorination protocols to achieve minimum chlorine residuals of 0.5 mg/L throughout the distribution system. Monitor residual levels at multiple points daily until bacterial contamination is eliminated.

3. **Resampling Protocol:** Collect follow-up samples from both wells within 48 hours. Continue daily sampling until three consecutive samples demonstrate compliance with bacterial standards.

4. **Source Investigation:** Conduct comprehensive sanitary survey of both wellhead areas to identify potential contamination sources. Particular attention should be paid to nearby industrial facilities, septic systems, and surface water drainage patterns.

5. **Alternative Supply:** Consider temporary shutdown of affected wells and activation of alternative water sources if available. If shutdown is not feasible, implement mandatory boil-water advisory for all consumers.

6. **Long-term Monitoring:** Establish enhanced bacteriological monitoring schedule with weekly sampling for minimum of three months following return to compliance.

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

This report is submitted in fulfillment of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 111, Section 160B, requiring bacteriological examination of public water supplies. Results indicate non-compliance with federal Safe Drinking Water Act standards (40 CFR 141.21) and Massachusetts Drinking Water Regulations (310 CMR 22.07).

The Woburn Water Commission is required to report these violations to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Division of Water Quality Control, within 48 hours and to implement corrective actions as specified above.

### LABORATORY CERTIFICATION

This analysis was performed under the supervision of laboratory personnel certified by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. All analytical procedures conform to approved methods and quality assurance protocols. Laboratory maintains certification under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 111, Section 161.
