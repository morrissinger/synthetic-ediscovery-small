# Letter from Zona Family Authorizing Legal Representation

February 10, 1982

Mr. Jan Schlichtmann  
Attorney at Law  
Boston, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Schlichtmann,

We are writing to you following our telephone conversation of February 8th regarding the tragic loss of our beloved son, Michael Zona, and the circumstances surrounding his death from leukemia. After much deliberation and prayer, my wife Margaret and I have decided to formally authorize you to represent our family in pursuing legal action against those responsible for contaminating our community's water supply.

Michael was only eight years old when he passed away on November 15, 1981, after a courageous three-year battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia. He was diagnosed in September 1978, just two months after his fifth birthday. Like the other families in our neighborhood, we had no reason to suspect that the water flowing from our taps on Maple Street contained dangerous chemicals. We trusted that our municipal water supply was safe—we gave Michael that water to drink every day of his short life, used it to prepare his meals, filled his bath with it. The thought that we might have been unknowingly exposing our precious boy to cancer-causing chemicals is almost too painful to bear.

When we learned about James Anderson's death in January and heard Mrs. Anderson speak about the possibility that contaminated wells might be connected to these childhood leukemia cases, we knew we had to act. Michael deserves justice, and if there is any chance that corporate negligence contributed to his suffering and death, then those responsible must be held accountable. We cannot bring our son back, but perhaps we can prevent other families from enduring this heartbreak.

We understand from our conversation that this will likely be a long and difficult legal battle. The companies involved have significant resources and will undoubtedly fight these allegations vigorously. However, we have faith in your commitment to seeking the truth about what happened in our community. Margaret and I are prepared to cooperate fully with your investigation, provide any documentation you require, and testify about Michael's illness and the impact of his loss on our family.

We authorize you to act on our behalf in filing wrongful death claims against W.R. Grace Company, Beatrice Foods, and any other parties that your investigation determines may be responsible for contaminating Wells G and H. We understand that you will be working on a contingency fee basis, meaning that we will not be responsible for attorney fees unless you are successful in obtaining a settlement or judgment on our behalf. We also understand that we may be responsible for certain costs and expenses related to the litigation, though you have assured us that you will advance these costs initially.

Michael was a bright, loving child who brought joy to everyone who knew him. He loved baseball and had dreams of playing for the Red Sox someday. He was kind to his younger sister Maria and protective of her in the way that big brothers are. His teachers at the elementary school always commented on his gentle nature and his eagerness to help his classmates. Even during his illness, when he was weak from chemotherapy treatments, he maintained his sweet disposition and rarely complained about his pain. He trusted us to keep him safe, and we feel that we failed him by not knowing about the danger in our water.

The medical records from Children's Hospital in Boston document the progression of Michael's illness from diagnosis through his final hospitalization. Dr. Patricia Williams, his oncologist, can provide testimony about his treatment and the aggressive nature of his leukemia. We have preserved all of his medical files, insurance records, and documentation of the expenses we incurred during his treatment. We also have photographs and school records that show what a healthy, normal child he was before the cancer took hold.

We want you to know that this decision was not made lightly. Margaret and I are private people who value our family's privacy, and we understand that pursuing this litigation will likely bring unwanted attention to our personal tragedy. However, we believe that Michael's death—and the deaths and illnesses of the other children in our community—demand answers. If industrial companies were dumping toxic chemicals that found their way into our drinking water, then they must face the consequences of their actions.

Please let us know what additional information or documentation you need from us to proceed. We are ready to move forward with this case and trust that you will represent Michael's interests—and ours—with the dedication and skill that this situation demands. Our son cannot speak for himself anymore, so we must speak for him and ensure that his death was not in vain.

We look forward to hearing from you soon about the next steps in this process.

With our sincere gratitude for your willingness to take on this important case,
