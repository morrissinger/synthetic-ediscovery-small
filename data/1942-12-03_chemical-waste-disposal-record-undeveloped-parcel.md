### DISPOSAL METHOD

Materials transported via horse-drawn cart to designated disposal area approximately 200 yards southwest of main tannery building. Site selected for distance from Aberjona River and railroad tracks. 

**Procedure:**
1. Excavated pit measuring 8 feet by 6 feet, depth 4 feet
2. Poured liquid wastes directly into pit
3. Emptied solid residues from containers
4. Covered with 2 feet of soil and industrial ash
5. Marked location with wooden stake (No. 334)

**Ground Conditions:** Sandy soil with clay layer at 3 feet depth. No standing water observed in excavation.

---

### CHEMICAL COMPOSITION NOTES

**Chrome Solutions:** High concentration of chromium sulfate and chromic acid from hide tanning process. Estimated 15-20% chromium content by weight.

**Lime Solutions:** Calcium hydroxide with organic matter from dehairing operations. pH approximately 12-13.

**Dye Materials:** Aniline-based colorants, primarily black and brown leather dyes. Contains benzidine compounds and coal tar derivatives.

**Solvents:** Mixture of petroleum distillates, turpentine, and industrial alcohol used for equipment cleaning and leather finishing.

**Tanning Extracts:** Concentrated solutions of oak bark, hemlock, and chestnut extracts with high tannin content.

### SITE SELECTION RATIONALE

Location chosen based on following criteria:
- Sufficient distance from active work areas to prevent interference with operations
- Adequate soil coverage available for proper burial
- Positioned to avoid direct runoff into Aberjona River during heavy rains
- Accessible by cart for efficient transport of waste materials
- Undeveloped land with no planned construction or agricultural use

Site appears suitable for containment of industrial waste materials. Clay layer observed at depth should provide natural barrier against downward migration of liquids.

### PREVIOUS DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

**Recent Disposals at Site:**
- November 18, 1942: 89 gallons mixed tanning solutions (Stake No. 331)
- November 2, 1942: 67 gallons chrome wastes and solvents (Stake No. 328)
- October 15, 1942: 112 gallons dehairing solutions (Stake No. 325)

**Estimated Total Volume Disposed (1942):** Approximately 2,800 gallons various chemical wastes

Site has proven adequate for disposal needs. No complaints received from neighboring properties. Railroad officials have not raised concerns about proximity to tracks.

---

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Operations conducted in accordance with standard industrial practices for leather manufacturing facilities. No specific waste disposal regulations currently applicable to tanning operations in Massachusetts.

Disposal methods consistent with recommendations from Massachusetts Leather Manufacturers Association regarding proper handling of tanning wastes. Site selection avoids direct discharge to waterways in compliance with general water protection guidelines.

---

### WORKER SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

All disposal activities conducted with appropriate safety measures:
- Workers equipped with rubber gloves and aprons
- Lime solutions handled with special care due to caustic properties
- Chrome materials kept separate from organic wastes during transport
- Site ventilation adequate to prevent accumulation of solvent vapors
- First aid supplies available at disposal site

No worker injuries or chemical exposures reported during disposal operations.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Continue monitoring clay barrier effectiveness during spring thaw period
2. Maintain minimum 50-foot buffer from Aberjona River for all disposal activities  
3. Consider rotation to alternate disposal sites if current location approaches capacity
4. Document all disposal activities for company records and potential regulatory inquiries
5. Evaluate soil conditions annually to ensure continued suitability for waste containment
