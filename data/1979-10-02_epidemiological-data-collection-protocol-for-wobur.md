## ABSTRACT

This protocol establishes systematic procedures for collecting epidemiological data regarding the reported cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Following the closure of municipal Wells G and H in May 1979 due to volatile organic compound contamination, community concerns have been raised regarding potential environmental health impacts. This investigation will employ standardized case-control methodology to examine potential associations between residential water exposure and leukemia incidence in the affected population.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background

On May 22, 1979, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering ordered the closure of Wells G and H serving East Woburn after detecting significant concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in routine water quality testing. These wells, operational since 1964 and 1966 respectively, served approximately 5,000 residents in the eastern section of Woburn.

Community health concerns were first raised by Mrs. Anne Anderson of 96 Meadowbrook Avenue, whose son James was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in 1972 at age three. Mrs. Anderson has documented additional childhood leukemia cases in the neighborhood and has requested formal health department investigation.

### 1.2 Preliminary Case Identification

Initial community inquiries have identified the following pediatric leukemia cases with residence in East Woburn:

- **James Anderson** (DOB: 1969) - Diagnosed 1972, acute lymphocytic leukemia
- **Kevin Kane Jr.** (DOB: 1963) - Diagnosed 1973, acute lymphocytic leukemia  
- **Michael Zona** (DOB: 1966) - Diagnosed 1974, acute myelocytic leukemia
- **Patrick Toomey** (DOB: 1966) - Diagnosed 1975, acute lymphocytic leukemia
- **Carl Robbins III** (DOB: 1970) - Diagnosed 1977, acute lymphocytic leukemia
- **Roland Gamache** (DOB: 1965) - Diagnosed 1978, acute lymphocytic leukemia

### 1.3 Study Objectives

**Primary Objective:** To determine whether the incidence of childhood leukemia in East Woburn exceeds expected rates based on state and national surveillance data.

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. Assess potential associations between residential water supply source and leukemia risk
2. Evaluate temporal patterns of disease occurrence relative to well operations
3. Identify additional environmental or demographic risk factors
4. Provide scientific basis for public health recommendations

## 2. METHODOLOGY

### 2.1 Study Design

This investigation will employ a retrospective case-control study design comparing children diagnosed with leukemia in East Woburn (cases) with healthy children from the same geographic area (controls).

### 2.2 Case Definition

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- Diagnosis of any form of leukemia before age 19
- Residence in East Woburn census tracts 3351, 3352, or 3353 at time of diagnosis
- Diagnosis date between January 1, 1964 and December 31, 1979

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- Residence outside defined geographic boundaries
- Insufficient medical documentation of diagnosis
- Secondary leukemia following previous cancer treatment

### 2.3 Control Selection

Controls will be selected using Massachusetts birth certificate records, matched 3:1 to cases by:
- Birth year (±2 years)
- Sex
- Census tract of residence

### 2.4 Data Collection Instruments

#### 2.4.1 Medical Record Abstraction Form

**Section A: Demographics**
- Name, date of birth, sex, race/ethnicity
- Address at diagnosis and birth
- Insurance status, primary physician

**Section B: Clinical Information**
- Date of diagnosis, diagnostic facility
- Leukemia subtype and staging
- Initial presenting symptoms
- Treatment history and response
- Survival status and follow-up

**Section C: Family History**
- Parental ages at child's birth
- Family history of cancer or blood disorders
- Maternal pregnancy history
- Birth weight and gestational age

#### 2.4.2 Environmental Exposure Questionnaire

**Section A: Residential History**
- Complete address history from birth to diagnosis
- Duration of residence at each address
- Type of housing (single family, apartment, etc.)
- Water supply source (municipal wells, private well, other)

**Section B: Water Usage Patterns**
- Primary source of drinking water
- Use of bottled water or filtration systems
- Swimming pool usage and location
- Occupational water exposures (parents)

**Section C: Other Environmental Exposures**
- Proximity to industrial facilities
- Parental occupational history
- Household chemical usage
- Tobacco smoke exposure

### 2.5 Data Sources

#### 2.5.1 Medical Records
- Massachusetts General Hospital Pediatric Oncology
- Children's Hospital Boston Hematology/Oncology
- Tufts-New England Medical Center
- Private pediatric practices in Woburn area

#### 2.5.2 Municipal Records
- Woburn Water Department service records
- Building permits and occupancy certificates
- City directories (1964-1979)

#### 2.5.3 Environmental Data
- Well G and H pumping records and water quality data
- Massachusetts DEQE contamination assessment reports
- Industrial facility permits and inspection records

## 3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN

### 3.1 Descriptive Analysis

**Incidence Rate Calculation:**
- Calculate age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates
- Compare to Massachusetts Cancer Registry data
- Assess statistical significance using Poisson distribution

**Temporal Analysis:**
- Plot cases by month and year of diagnosis
- Evaluate clustering using Knox test for space-time interaction
- Correlate with well operational periods

### 3.2 Risk Factor Analysis

**Univariate Analysis:**
- Calculate odds ratios for each exposure variable
- Use Fisher's exact test for categorical variables
- Apply Mantel-Haenszel stratified analysis for confounders

**Multivariate Analysis:**
- Develop logistic regression models
- Include significant univariate predictors (p<0.10)
- Assess model fit using likelihood ratio tests

### 3.3 Dose-Response Assessment

**Water Exposure Metrics:**
- Duration of residence served by Wells G and H
- Estimated cumulative water consumption
- Proximity to well locations

**Exposure Windows:**
- In utero exposure (maternal residence during pregnancy)
- Early childhood exposure (ages 0-5)
- Total lifetime exposure through diagnosis

## 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE

### 4.1 Data Collection Training

All field investigators will complete standardized training including:
- Interview techniques for sensitive health information
- Medical record abstraction procedures
- Confidentiality requirements and HIPAA compliance
- Quality control checklists

### 4.2 Data Verification

**Medical Record Validation:**
- Independent review of 10% of abstracted records
- Pathology report confirmation for all leukemia diagnoses
- Verification of diagnostic dates and staging information

**Residential History Validation:**
- Cross-reference with city directories and voter registrations
- Confirm water service connections with municipal records
- Validate addresses using postal service records
