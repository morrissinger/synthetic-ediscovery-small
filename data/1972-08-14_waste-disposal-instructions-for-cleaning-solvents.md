## WORK INSTRUCTION MEMORANDUM

**TO:** All Production Floor Workers - Shifts A, B, C  
**FROM:** Harold R. Mitchell, Shift Supervisor  
**DATE:** August 14, 1972  
**RE:** Revised Procedures for Disposal of Cleaning Solvents and Chemical Waste

---

### IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED

Effective immediately, all production floor personnel must follow these updated procedures for the disposal of cleaning solvents and chemical waste materials generated during normal shift operations. These instructions supersede all previous verbal guidance and are to be posted at each workstation.

### CLEANING SOLVENT DISPOSAL PROCEDURES

**Primary Solvents (TCE, PCE, and related compounds):**

1. **Daily Cleaning Operations:** Used trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) from equipment cleaning shall be collected in the designated 55-gallon drums located at stations 4, 7, and 12. Do not mix different solvent types in the same container.

2. **Drum Management:** When drums reach 80% capacity, notify the shift supervisor immediately. Full drums are to be moved to the rear loading dock area behind Building 2 for temporary storage pending pickup.

3. **Overflow Procedures:** In the event that designated drums are full and replacement drums are not immediately available, excess solvents may be disposed of via the floor drains located in the southeast corner of the production floor. Ensure adequate water flow to facilitate drainage.

**Secondary Chemical Waste:**

1. **Contaminated Materials:** Rags, filters, and other materials contaminated with cleaning solvents should be placed in the metal waste containers positioned near each workstation exit. These containers will be emptied during the night shift.

2. **Equipment Rinse Water:** Water used for final equipment rinsing may contain trace amounts of cleaning chemicals. This rinse water should be directed to the floor drain system, which connects to the facility's waste management system.

### STORAGE AND HANDLING PROTOCOLS

**Temporary Storage Area:**

The area behind Building 2 serves as the primary staging location for filled solvent drums awaiting removal. This area provides adequate ventilation and is positioned away from the main production areas. Drums should be arranged in rows of no more than four containers wide, with adequate spacing for forklift access.

**Documentation Requirements:**

Each filled drum must be marked with the date of completion and the shift supervisor's initials. A log sheet will be maintained at the supervisor's station documenting the number of drums staged for removal each week.

### SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

All personnel handling cleaning solvents must wear appropriate protective equipment as outlined in the facility safety manual. Adequate ventilation should be maintained in all work areas, and any spills should be reported immediately to the shift supervisor.

**Environmental Compliance:**

These procedures have been developed to ensure efficient waste management while maintaining compliance with applicable regulations. The facility's waste disposal methods have been reviewed and approved by management to ensure proper handling of all chemical materials.

### QUESTIONS AND COMPLIANCE

Any questions regarding these procedures should be directed to the shift supervisor or plant manager. All production personnel are required to acknowledge receipt of these instructions by signing the posted acknowledgment form at each workstation.

Failure to follow these disposal procedures may result in disciplinary action. These instructions are effective immediately and will remain in effect until further notice.
