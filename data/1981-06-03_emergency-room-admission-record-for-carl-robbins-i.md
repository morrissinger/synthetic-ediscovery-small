## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carl Robbins III, an 8-year-old male with a known history of acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed in September 1980, presents to the emergency department with his mother Donna Robbins reporting a three-day history of increasing lethargy, high fever reaching 102.8°F, and the appearance of multiple petechiae and ecchymoses on his arms and legs. Mother states that Carl has been complaining of severe fatigue and has been unable to participate in normal childhood activities. She reports that he has had minimal appetite and has been sleeping 12-14 hours per day.

Patient was diagnosed with ALL in September 1980 at Massachusetts General Hospital following presentation with similar symptoms. He has been undergoing treatment with Dr. Robert Chen in the pediatric oncology department at MGH, with his last chemotherapy cycle completed two weeks ago. Mother reports compliance with all prescribed medications including prednisone, vincristine, and methotrexate per the standard pediatric ALL protocol.

The family has resided at their current address on Pine Street in Woburn for the past six years, with Carl having lived there since age two. Mother reports that the family's water supply comes from the municipal system, specifically noting that they have always used tap water for drinking, cooking, and bathing. When questioned about environmental exposures, mother mentions awareness of other children in the neighborhood who have been diagnosed with leukemia, including James Anderson who recently passed away in January.
