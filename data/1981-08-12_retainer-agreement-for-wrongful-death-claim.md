**RE: Retainer Agreement for Wrongful Death Claim - Carl Robbins III**

Dear Mrs. Robbins:

This letter will confirm our agreement regarding my representation of you and your family in connection with the wrongful death of your son, Carl Robbins III, who died on March 14, 1981, at the age of seven years. As we discussed during our meeting on August 10, 1981, I believe you have substantial grounds for legal action against those parties responsible for the contamination of Woburn's municipal water supply, which I believe directly caused your son's acute lymphocytic leukemia and subsequent death.

Based on my preliminary investigation and the information you have provided, I understand that Carl was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in September 1978, when he was four years old. Your family resided at 47 Maple Street in Woburn from 1971 through the present, and during this entire period, your household water supply was provided by the City of Woburn through Wells G and H. These wells, which began operation in 1964 and 1966 respectively, have been found to contain significant concentrations of industrial solvents, including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, which are known carcinogens. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has confirmed that these wells were contaminated with these toxic chemicals at levels far exceeding safe drinking water standards.

I have reason to believe that several industrial facilities in the vicinity of these wells, including but not limited to W.R. Grace Company's Cryovac division facility, Beatrice Foods operations, and other manufacturing companies, have improperly disposed of industrial solvents and other hazardous chemicals, causing groundwater contamination that ultimately reached the municipal water supply. The pattern of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn, including your son Carl, strongly suggests a causal relationship between this contamination and these tragic deaths.

## Terms of Representation

**Scope of Representation:** I agree to represent you in pursuing all available legal remedies for the wrongful death of Carl Robbins III, including but not limited to claims for:

1. **Wrongful Death** under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 229, seeking damages for the loss of your son's life, including his reasonably expected net income during his natural life expectancy;

2. **Conscious Pain and Suffering** experienced by Carl from the time of his diagnosis through his death, including physical pain, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life during his illness;

3. **Negligence** against all responsible parties for their failure to exercise reasonable care in the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous chemicals, and their failure to prevent contamination of the groundwater and municipal water supply.

**Contingency Fee Arrangement:** You will not be required to pay any attorney's fees unless and until we obtain a recovery through settlement or judgment. In the event of a successful recovery, my fee will be thirty-three and one-third percent (33⅓%) of the gross amount recovered if the case is resolved prior to the commencement of trial, and forty percent (40%) of the gross amount recovered if the case proceeds to trial or appeal. This percentage will be calculated after deduction of all costs and expenses as described below.

**Costs and Expenses:** All necessary costs and expenses of litigation will be advanced by this office, including but not limited to court filing fees, deposition costs, expert witness fees, medical record procurement, environmental testing, and other investigative expenses. These costs will be reimbursed from any recovery obtained, and you will not be personally liable for these expenses regardless of the outcome of the case. However, I estimate that the costs in a case of this complexity may exceed $50,000, given the need for extensive environmental testing, medical expert testimony, and prolonged discovery proceedings.

**Case Assessment:** I must advise you that environmental contamination cases are extremely complex and expensive to prosecute. We will be required to prove not only that the defendants improperly disposed of chemicals, but also that these chemicals migrated through groundwater to Wells G and H, that Carl consumed this contaminated water, and that this consumption was a substantial contributing factor to his leukemia and death. This will require extensive environmental investigation, hydrogeological studies, medical expert testimony, and epidemiological analysis.

The defendants in this case are likely to include major corporations with substantial resources and experienced legal counsel. They will undoubtedly dispute both causation and liability, and may argue that leukemia can result from various causes unrelated to chemical exposure. We must be prepared for protracted litigation that may continue for several years.

**Your Obligations:** To assist in the prosecution of this case, I will need your full cooperation in providing all relevant medical records, employment histories, residential histories, and other information that may be relevant to establishing damages and causation. You should preserve all documents related to Carl's illness, treatment, and your family's residence in Woburn. Additionally, please do not discuss the details of this case with anyone other than immediate family members without first consulting with me.

**Other Potential Claimants:** I am aware that other families in East Woburn have lost children to leukemia under similar circumstances, including the Anderson family, whose son James died in January of this year. While each family's case will be prosecuted individually, there may be opportunities for coordinated discovery and shared expert testimony that could reduce costs and strengthen all of our cases.

**Authority to Proceed:** By signing this agreement, you authorize me to commence all necessary legal proceedings, conduct discovery, retain expert witnesses, and take all other actions necessary to prosecute your claim. You also authorize me to investigate all potential defendants and to add additional parties as defendants if the evidence warrants such action.

**Settlement Authority:** Any settlement of your case will require your written approval. I will not accept any settlement offer without first discussing it with you and obtaining your consent. However, I strongly recommend that you carefully consider any reasonable settlement offers, as the risks and uncertainties of trial in a case of this type are substantial.

## Environmental Investigation Findings

Based on my preliminary investigation, I have learned that the Environmental Protection Agency has been investigating groundwater contamination in the vicinity of Wells G and H since 1979. Their testing has revealed the presence of trichloroethylene (TCE) at concentrations as high as 400 parts per billion in Well G, and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) at 43 parts per billion in Well H. These levels far exceed the EPA's proposed maximum contaminant levels for drinking water.

The W.R. Grace Company's Cryovac facility, located at 201 Mishawum Road, has been identified as a significant source of groundwater contamination. This facility has manufactured plastic food packaging materials since 1960, using large quantities of TCE and other industrial solvents. Evidence suggests that Cryovac disposed of waste solvents by dumping them on the ground behind their facility, allowing these chemicals to seep into the groundwater and migrate toward the municipal wells.

Similarly, the Beatrice Foods facility and other industrial operations in the area appear to have engaged in improper disposal practices that contributed to the contamination. The John J. Riley Company, which operated a leather tanning facility, also used and disposed of various chemicals that may have contributed to the groundwater contamination.

## Conclusion

Mrs. Robbins, I want to emphasize that while I believe you have a strong case, environmental litigation is inherently uncertain and expensive. The loss of Carl is an irreparable tragedy that no amount of money can remedy. However, holding these companies accountable for their actions may prevent similar tragedies in the future and provide some measure of justice for Carl's suffering and death.

If you agree to these terms, please sign and return one copy of this letter to my office. I will then begin immediate preparation of the complaint and commence formal legal proceedings against all responsible parties.

Please call me if you have any questions about this agreement or about the prosecution of your case. I am committed to pursuing this matter vigorously and to keeping you fully informed of all developments.

Very truly yours,

**Jan Schlichtmann**  
Attorney for Donna Robbins
