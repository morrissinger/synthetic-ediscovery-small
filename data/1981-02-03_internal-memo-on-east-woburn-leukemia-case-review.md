# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Director, Massachusetts Department of Public Health  
**FROM:** Dr. Sarah Mitchell, Chief Epidemiologist  
**DATE:** February 3, 1981  
**RE:** Urgent Case Review Assignment - East Woburn Childhood Leukemia Cluster

## Background and Immediate Concerns

Following the tragic death of James Anderson on January 18, 1981, and mounting community concerns regarding an apparent cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn, I am requesting immediate authorization to establish a comprehensive epidemiological investigation team. The Anderson case, while heartbreaking in its individual tragedy, may represent a broader public health crisis requiring immediate departmental intervention and resources.

Initial preliminary data suggests a statistically significant clustering of acute lymphocytic leukemia cases among children in the East Woburn area, particularly those residing in neighborhoods served by municipal Wells G and H. The Anderson family's seventeen-year residence at 11 Orange Street, combined with James's nine-year battle with leukemia following his 1972 diagnosis, presents a compelling case study that demands thorough investigation. Of particular concern is the temporal relationship between the opening of Wells G and H in 1964 and 1966 respectively, and the subsequent emergence of childhood leukemia cases in the served population.

## Proposed Investigation Framework

I recommend establishing a three-phase investigation protocol to examine potential environmental causation factors. Phase One should involve comprehensive case identification and mapping of all childhood leukemia diagnoses in East Woburn from 1970 to present, with particular attention to residential proximity to the affected water supply system. Phase Two must include detailed water quality analysis and historical contamination assessment of Wells G and H, including testing for industrial solvents and other potential carcinogens. Phase Three should encompass a broader environmental survey of industrial activities in the watershed area, with specific focus on waste disposal practices of local manufacturing facilities.

Given the potential legal implications of our findings, all documentation must be maintained according to strict evidentiary standards. The recent community organizing efforts, led by concerned parents including Anne Anderson, suggest that civil litigation may be forthcoming. Our department's investigation could provide crucial scientific evidence regarding causation patterns, making methodological rigor and documentation integrity paramount to our public health mission.

## Resource Requirements and Timeline

This investigation will require assignment of two additional epidemiologists, one environmental health specialist, and administrative support for data management and community liaison activities. I estimate initial costs of $45,000 for the first six months, with potential additional funding needs depending on the scope of contamination discovered. Given the urgency of community health concerns and the possibility of ongoing exposure, I recommend immediate commencement of field activities within two weeks of authorization.

The potential implications of this case extend far beyond East Woburn, as similar industrial contamination scenarios may exist throughout Massachusetts. Our response to this crisis will establish precedents for environmental health protection and could significantly impact future regulatory oversight of industrial waste disposal practices affecting municipal water supplies.
