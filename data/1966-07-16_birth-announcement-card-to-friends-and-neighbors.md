# Birth Announcement

**July 16, 1966**

Dear Friends and Neighbors,

Frank and I are overjoyed to announce the arrival of our precious son, **Michael Anthony Zona**, who was born on July 12, 1966, at 3:42 AM at Winchester Hospital. Our little miracle weighed 7 pounds, 4 ounces and measured 20 inches long. He has the most beautiful dark hair and his father's strong chin already!

The delivery went wonderfully, and Dr. Patterson says Michael is in perfect health. He's already showing such a strong personality - very alert and curious about everything around him. Frank jokes that he's going to be a handful, but we couldn't be more blessed. Our families are absolutely thrilled, especially Frank's mother who has been knitting blankets and booties for months in preparation.

We wanted to share this wonderful news with all of you who have become such dear friends since we moved to Montvale Road three years ago. This neighborhood has truly become our home, and we're so grateful for the warm community we've found here in East Woburn. From the Andersons helping us with our garden last spring to the Gamaches always looking out for our house when we travel to see family in Providence, you've all made us feel so welcome.

Michael will be baptized at St. Charles Church on August 6th at 2:00 PM, and we would be honored if you could join us for this special celebration. Afterwards, we're planning a small gathering at our home on Montvale Road. Nothing fancy - just cake, coffee, and the chance to meet our little one properly. The ladies from the church auxiliary have been so kind, offering to help with preparations.

We're settling into our new routine as a family of three, though I must admit the sleepless nights are taking some adjustment! Frank has been wonderful, taking the early morning feedings so I can rest. He's already talking about teaching Michael to play baseball in the backyard and showing him how to work on cars in the garage. I keep reminding him that our son is only four days old, but you know how excited new fathers can be.

Thank you all for the beautiful flowers, casseroles, and kind words during these first few days. Mrs. Kane from down the street brought the most delicious lasagna yesterday, and the Toomeys left a lovely arrangement of roses from their garden on our front step. It's gestures like these that remind us how fortunate we are to live in such a caring community.

We look forward to introducing Michael to all of you soon and to watching him grow up surrounded by such wonderful neighbors and friends. East Woburn truly is a perfect place to raise a family, with good schools, safe streets, and clean air and water for our children.

With much love and excitement,

Joan & Frank Zona  
15 Montvale Road  
East Woburn, Massachusetts

*P.S. - Frank wanted me to mention that he's finally finished painting the nursery - pale yellow with white trim, perfect for our little angel. Stop by anytime to meet Michael!*
