# INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Operations Manager, Cryovac Division  
**FROM:** Robert Mitchell, Purchasing Manager  
**DATE:** November 7, 1972  
**RE:** Budget Approval for Industrial Solvent Purchases - Fiscal Year 1973

This memo serves to request formal budget approval for the procurement of industrial solvents required for our Woburn facility operations during fiscal year 1973. Based on production forecasts and current inventory levels, we anticipate increased solvent requirements to support expanded packaging film operations and equipment maintenance protocols.

**Requested Budget Allocation: $127,500**

The breakdown of solvent requirements includes trichloroethylene (TCE) for degreasing operations ($45,000), perchloroethylene (PCE) for precision cleaning of manufacturing equipment ($38,500), and various secondary solvents including 1,1,1-trichloroethane for general maintenance applications ($44,000). These chemicals are essential for maintaining production quality standards and ensuring proper equipment functionality. Our current supplier, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, has provided competitive pricing based on volume commitments, and we have negotiated favorable terms for quarterly deliveries to our Route 129 facility.

Storage and handling procedures remain consistent with our established protocols. Solvents are maintained in designated storage areas with appropriate containment systems, and disposal of spent materials continues through our contracted waste management service. The facility's proximity to the Aberjona River requires that we maintain strict adherence to all applicable safety standards, though current regulations provide considerable flexibility in operational procedures. Our maintenance staff has been trained in proper handling techniques, and we have implemented routine inspection schedules for all storage containers and transfer equipment.

I recommend immediate approval of this budget request to ensure uninterrupted production capacity for the coming fiscal year. Delays in solvent procurement could impact our ability to meet delivery commitments to major accounts, particularly our contracts with food packaging clients who require consistent product quality. Please advise of your decision by November 15th to allow sufficient lead time for purchase order processing and delivery scheduling.
