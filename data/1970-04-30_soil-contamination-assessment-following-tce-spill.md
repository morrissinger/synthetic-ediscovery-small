## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Environmental Consulting Associates was retained by W.R. Grace Company to conduct a preliminary soil contamination assessment following the reported trichloroethylene (TCE) spill incident that occurred on March 15, 1970, at the Cryovac Division facility located on Washington Street in Woburn, Massachusetts. This assessment was conducted in accordance with standard industrial practices and available analytical methodologies for chlorinated solvent detection in soil media.

The investigation focused on the immediate vicinity of the reported spill location near Building 7, where approximately 850 gallons of TCE were released during a tank transfer operation. Soil samples were collected from twelve locations within a 200-foot radius of the spill epicenter and analyzed for volatile organic compounds using gas chromatography methods available at the time of this assessment.

Results indicate elevated concentrations of TCE in soil samples collected within 50 feet of the spill location, with concentrations ranging from 125 to 2,400 parts per million (ppm) in the upper soil horizon. Background concentrations in control samples collected from unaffected areas of the facility property measured below detection limits of 5 ppm.

## SITE DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND

The W.R. Grace Company Cryovac Division facility occupies approximately 52 acres of industrial property bounded by Washington Street to the north, the Aberjona River to the east, and residential neighborhoods to the south and west. The facility has been in continuous operation since 1963, manufacturing plastic food packaging materials and related products.

The spill occurred in the northeastern section of the property, approximately 300 feet from the Aberjona River and 150 feet from the nearest residential property boundary. The affected area consists of relatively level terrain with sandy loam soils overlying glacial outwash deposits. Depth to groundwater in this area is estimated at 8-12 feet below ground surface based on monitoring well data from the facility's industrial water supply system.

Local topography slopes gently eastward toward the Aberjona River, with surface drainage following this general gradient. The facility maintains several surface water retention areas and drainage channels that ultimately discharge to the river system.

## METHODOLOGY

### Sample Collection

Soil samples were collected on April 2-3, 1970, using hollow-stem auger drilling equipment operated by Northeastern Drilling Company of Malden, Massachusetts. Sample locations were established using a grid pattern centered on the reported spill location, with additional samples collected from background areas for comparison purposes.

Samples were collected at depths of 0-2 feet, 2-4 feet, and 4-6 feet below ground surface at each location. All samples were collected using clean sampling equipment and transferred immediately to glass containers with Teflon-lined caps to minimize volatile losses. Samples were maintained at 4°C and delivered to the analytical laboratory within 24 hours of collection.

### Analytical Methods

Analysis for volatile organic compounds was performed by Industrial Testing Laboratories of Boston, Massachusetts, using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The analytical method employed was based on EPA Method 8010 for halogenated volatile organics, modified for soil matrix analysis.

Sample preparation involved methanol extraction followed by direct injection into the gas chromatograph. Detection limits for TCE in soil were approximately 5 ppm based on the analytical instrumentation available. Quality control measures included duplicate analysis of 10% of samples and analysis of laboratory blanks with each sample batch.

## RESULTS AND FINDINGS

### Soil Contamination Extent

Analytical results confirm the presence of TCE contamination in soil samples collected from the immediate spill area. The highest concentrations were detected in surface soil samples (0-2 feet depth) collected within 25 feet of the spill epicenter, with a maximum detected concentration of 2,400 ppm TCE in sample location SL-03.

Contamination appears to be primarily confined to the upper soil horizon, with concentrations decreasing significantly with depth. At the 4-6 foot sampling interval, only three locations showed detectable TCE concentrations above the 5 ppm detection limit, suggesting limited vertical migration at the time of this assessment.

The lateral extent of contamination extends approximately 75 feet from the spill location in the direction of the prevailing groundwater flow gradient (eastward toward the Aberjona River). Concentrations decrease to near background levels at this distance.

### Soil Characteristics

Soil samples from the affected area consist primarily of sandy loam with moderate organic content (2-4%). Permeability appears relatively high based on field observations during drilling operations, which may facilitate contaminant migration if additional releases occur.

The presence of a clay lens at approximately 6-8 feet depth in several locations may provide some limitation to vertical contaminant migration, though the extent and continuity of this feature requires additional investigation to fully characterize.

## DISCUSSION

The detected TCE concentrations in soil represent a localized contamination event that appears to be directly related to the March 15, 1970 spill incident. The distribution pattern of contamination is consistent with surface release and subsequent infiltration into the soil profile.

While the immediate area of highest contamination is relatively small, the presence of detectable concentrations at the periphery of the investigation area suggests that the full extent of impact may not have been completely delineated by this preliminary assessment.

The proximity of the contaminated area to the Aberjona River and the relatively permeable nature of the local soils raise concerns about potential migration of contaminants toward surface water resources. Additionally, the depth to groundwater in this area suggests that continued vertical migration could potentially impact groundwater quality if remedial measures are not implemented.

## CONCLUSIONS

1. Soil contamination from TCE has been confirmed in the immediate vicinity of the March 15, 1970 spill location, with concentrations ranging up to 2,400 ppm in surface soil samples.

2. Contamination appears to be primarily confined to the upper 6 feet of the soil profile at the time of this assessment, though vertical migration potential exists given local soil conditions.

3. The lateral extent of contamination extends approximately 75 feet from the spill epicenter, following the general direction of groundwater flow toward the Aberjona River.

4. Background soil samples collected from unaffected areas of the facility property showed no detectable TCE contamination above analytical detection limits.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the findings of this assessment, Environmental Consulting Associates recommends the following actions:

1. **Immediate Remediation**: Remove contaminated soil from the area of highest impact (concentrations >500 ppm TCE) and dispose of this material at an approved industrial waste facility.

2. **Extended Monitoring**: Establish a groundwater monitoring program to assess potential impacts to the underlying aquifer system, with particular attention to wells positioned downgradient of the contaminated area.

3. **Surface Water Surveillance**: Implement periodic sampling of surface water discharge points to the Aberjona River to monitor for potential contaminant migration.

4. **Facility Improvements**: Review and upgrade chemical handling and storage procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

5. **Additional Investigation**: Consider expanding the soil investigation area to fully delineate the extent of contamination, particularly in the downgradient direction.
