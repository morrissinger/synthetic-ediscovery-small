**Telephone:** (617) 555-3294  
**Occupation:** Secretary, Woburn Public Schools  
**Marital Status:** Divorced  

**Family Members:**
- Christine Anderson (daughter, age 20, born 1962)
- Charles Anderson (son, age 16, born 1966)
- James Anderson (deceased son, age 12, died January 18, 1981)

## FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Mrs. Anderson came to our office today, two days after the death of her twelve-year-old son James from acute lymphocytic leukemia. She has been a resident of 11 Orange Street in Woburn for seventeen years, having moved there in 1964. The family has consistently received municipal water service from the City of Woburn throughout their residency.

### Timeline of Events

**1968:** James Anderson born July 16, 1968, at Winchester Hospital  
**1972:** James diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia at age 3 (January 1972)  
**1972-1981:** Continuous medical treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital and Children's Hospital  
**1981:** James Anderson died January 18, 1981, at age 12

### Medical History

James underwent extensive treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia over a nine-year period. Medical records indicate:
- Initial diagnosis at Massachusetts General Hospital, January 1972
- Primary treating physician: Dr. Robert Weinstein, Pediatric Oncology
- Treatment included chemotherapy protocols standard for the period
- Multiple hospitalizations and remissions
- Final hospitalization: January 10-18, 1981

Mrs. Anderson reports that James was a healthy infant and toddler prior to his diagnosis. No family history of leukemia or other blood cancers. Both older siblings remain healthy.

### Water Supply Information

The Anderson residence has been served by Woburn municipal water since 1964. Mrs. Anderson indicates the family has used tap water for all household purposes including:
- Drinking water (prepared formula for James as infant)
- Cooking and food preparation
- Bathing and personal hygiene
- Household cleaning

She reports no unusual taste, odor, or appearance of the water during their residency, though she notes occasional "chemical smell" particularly in summer months.

### Community Health Concerns

Mrs. Anderson reports awareness of other childhood leukemia cases in the neighborhood:
- Kevin Kane Jr. (died 1981, age unknown to client)
- Several other families on Orange Street and nearby areas with sick children
- Growing community concern about cluster of childhood cancers

She indicates recent community meetings regarding water quality concerns and potential environmental contamination sources.

## POTENTIAL LEGAL THEORIES

### 1. Wrongful Death

Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 229 provides cause of action for wrongful death where death results from wrongful act, neglect, or default of another. Potential defendants include:

**Municipal Defendants:**
- City of Woburn (water supply operation)
- Woburn Department of Public Works
- Individual municipal officials (capacity issues to be researched)

**Corporate Defendants:**
- Industrial facilities in Woburn area (to be identified through investigation)
- Chemical manufacturers/users
- Waste disposal companies

### 2. Negligence

Standard negligence claims against all potentially responsible parties for:
- Failure to properly test water supply
- Failure to warn of contamination
- Improper disposal of industrial chemicals
- Breach of duty to provide safe municipal water

### 3. Strict Liability

Potential strict liability claims for:
- Abnormally dangerous activities (chemical disposal)
- Defective product (contaminated water supply)

### 4. Nuisance

Public and private nuisance claims for contamination of groundwater and municipal water supply.

## INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Medical Records:** Obtain complete medical records for James Anderson from all treating facilities
2. **Water Testing:** Determine current and historical water quality data for Woburn municipal supply
3. **Environmental Investigation:** Identify industrial sources of potential contamination
4. **Expert Consultants:** Retain environmental and medical experts
5. **Community Survey:** Document other affected families and health impacts
6. **Municipal Records:** Obtain water department records, testing data, complaints

### Long-term Investigation

1. **Industrial Defendants:** Comprehensive investigation of Woburn area industrial facilities
2. **Regulatory Records:** EPA, state environmental agency files
3. **Epidemiological Study:** Document cancer cluster through medical professionals
4. **Hydrogeological Analysis:** Groundwater flow patterns and contamination sources

## LEGAL CHALLENGES

### Causation Issues

Establishing causal connection between water contamination and James's leukemia will be primary challenge. Requirements:
- Medical expert testimony on general causation (can contaminated water cause leukemia)
- Specific causation (did contaminated water cause James's leukemia)
- Epidemiological evidence of increased cancer rates
- Toxicological evidence regarding specific contaminants

### Statute of Limitations

Massachusetts three-year statute of limitations for wrongful death runs from date of death (January 18, 1981). Discovery rule may apply if contamination was not reasonably discoverable earlier.

### Sovereign Immunity

Municipal defendants may claim governmental immunity. Research required on scope of immunity for water supply operations.

### Damages Calculations

Wrongful death damages under Massachusetts law limited to:
- Conscious suffering (if any)
- Loss of reasonably expected net income
- Loss of services, protection, care, and assistance
- Reasonable funeral expenses
- Punitive damages not available under Massachusetts wrongful death statute

## PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT

This case presents significant legal and factual challenges but may have substantial merit if:
1. Water contamination can be documented
2. Industrial source(s) can be identified
3. Medical causation can be established through expert testimony
4. Other affected families join as plaintiffs (class action potential)

The case will require substantial financial investment for expert witnesses, environmental investigation, and extensive discovery. Contingency fee arrangement recommended given client's financial circumstances.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Retain Case:** Recommend accepting representation on contingency fee basis
2. **Immediate Investigation:** Begin water testing and industrial source investigation immediately
3. **Expert Retention:** Retain environmental consultant and medical expert within 30 days
4. **Community Outreach:** Identify other affected families for potential joint litigation
5. **Regulatory Filings:** Consider EPA complaint to trigger federal investigation
6. **Media Strategy:** Careful approach to publicity to maintain pressure while protecting case

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Retainer Agreement:** Prepare contingency fee agreement for client signature
2. **Medical Records Release:** Obtain signed releases for all James's medical records
3. **Expert Consultations:** Schedule meetings with environmental and medical experts
4. **Investigation Plan:** Develop comprehensive investigation timeline and budget
5. **Client Interview:** Schedule follow-up meeting to obtain additional details

## CASE EVALUATION

**Strength of Case:** Moderate to Strong (pending investigation results)  
**Estimated Timeline:** 3-5 years to resolution  
**Estimated Costs:** $75,000-$150,000 for investigation and expert witnesses  
**Settlement Potential:** High if liability established  
**Trial Risk:** Significant due to causation issues
