## MEETING PURPOSE

Initial consultation regarding potential wrongful death and negligence claims arising from childhood leukemia deaths in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Clients seek legal representation for claims against industrial defendants believed responsible for groundwater contamination affecting municipal Wells G and H.

## CLIENT BACKGROUND AND CASE SUMMARY

### **Anne Anderson - Primary Client**

**Residence:** 11 Orange Street, Woburn, MA (17 years)  
**Deceased Child:** James Anderson, DOB: July 16, 1968, DOD: January 18, 1981  
**Cause of Death:** Acute lymphocytic leukemia  
**Other Children:** Christine Anderson (b. 1962), Charles Anderson (b. 1966)

Mrs. Anderson presented compelling testimony regarding her son James's nine-year battle with leukemia, diagnosed in January 1972 at age three. The family consumed municipal water from Wells G and H throughout James's entire life, including prenatal period. Mrs. Anderson noted unusual taste and odor in tap water beginning in mid-1960s but was assured by city officials that water met safety standards.

**Key Timeline Points:**
- 1964-1966: Wells G and H opened for municipal water supply
- 1968: James Anderson born
- 1972: James diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia
- 1979: Wells G and H closed due to contamination discovery
- 1981: James Anderson died, age 12

### **Additional Clients Present**

**Patricia Toomey:** Mother of Patrick Toomey, deceased from leukemia. Resided on Pine Street, also served by Wells G and H water system.

**Donna Robbins:** Mother of Carl Robbins III, deceased from leukemia. Family resided on Salem Street within affected water district.

## CONTAMINATION EVIDENCE DISCUSSED

### **Water Supply Analysis**
- Wells G and H served approximately 5,000 residents in East Woburn
- EPA testing revealed trichloroethylene concentrations up to 400 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene detected at 43 parts per billion
- Contamination levels far exceed safe drinking water standards
- Wells closed May 1979 following contamination discovery

### **Industrial Sources Identified**
Based on preliminary investigation and EPA findings:

1. **W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Division**
   - Located on Olympia Avenue, adjacent to Aberjona River
   - Manufacturing facility using industrial solvents
   - Documented disposal practices on-site

2. **Beatrice Foods Company**
   - Industrial operations upstream from wells
   - Historical use of trichloroethylene and related compounds

3. **John J. Riley Company**
