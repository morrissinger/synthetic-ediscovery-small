# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** John J. Riley, Owner and General Manager  
**FROM:** H.M. Whitman, Company Accountant  
**DATE:** December 1, 1929  
**RE:** Chromium and Vegetable Tanning Operations Financial Review

## Summary of Current Operations and Costs

Mr. Riley, as requested, I have completed a comprehensive review of our tannery operations for the fiscal year ending November 30, 1929. Our facility at 228 Salem Street continues to demonstrate strong performance in both chromium sulfate and vegetable tanning processes, though certain operational costs warrant your immediate attention.

Our chromium tanning division processed approximately 2,400 hides during the past twelve months, utilizing 18,500 pounds of chromium sulfate at a total chemical cost of $1,847.50. The chromium process continues to provide superior leather quality for our automotive and industrial clients, particularly given the increasing demand from Massachusetts shoe manufacturers. However, the disposal of spent chromium liquors has become increasingly problematic. Our current practice of discharging these solutions into the drainage system leading toward the Aberjona River has drawn occasional complaints from downstream property owners, though no formal actions have been taken against the company.

The vegetable tanning operations, utilizing bark extracts and other organic tannins, processed 1,850 hides with material costs totaling $923.75. While these operations generate substantially less chemical waste, the longer processing times continue to impact our overall production efficiency. The spent vegetable tanning liquors, being organic in nature, appear to cause fewer concerns when discharged with our other process waters.

## Waste Disposal and Operational Concerns

Our current waste disposal practices, while economical, may require future modification. The chromium-bearing solutions, after exhausting their tanning capacity, contain significant concentrations of trivalent chromium compounds that impart a distinctive green coloration to our discharge waters. Local residents have noted discoloration in portions of the Aberjona River during periods of heavy production, though the Massachusetts Department of Health has not issued any formal guidance regarding industrial discharge standards for tannery operations.

I recommend establishing a reserve fund of $500 annually to address potential future requirements for waste treatment or alternative disposal methods. While current regulations impose no specific restrictions on our discharge practices, the evolving industrial landscape suggests that municipalities may eventually require more stringent waste management procedures. The proximity of our operations to the railroad tracks provides potential access to alternative disposal methods, including rail transport of concentrated waste materials to approved disposal sites, should such requirements emerge.

## Financial Recommendations and Future Planning

Given the strong performance of both tanning operations and the continued growth in demand for quality leather goods, I recommend maintaining current production levels while establishing contingency plans for waste management modifications. The total operational profit for fiscal year 1929 reached $12,847.33, representing a 15% increase over the previous year. This growth provides adequate capital for potential infrastructure improvements while maintaining our competitive position in the regional leather market.

The strategic location of our facility continues to provide significant advantages, including ready access to transportation infrastructure and abundant water resources from local wells and the Aberjona River system. These natural advantages, combined with our established customer relationships and proven tanning expertise, position the John J. Riley Company for continued success throughout the coming decade, regardless of potential changes in industrial waste management requirements.
