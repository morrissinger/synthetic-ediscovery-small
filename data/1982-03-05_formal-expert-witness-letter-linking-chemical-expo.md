**RE: Expert Medical Opinion - James Anderson Leukemia Case**  
**Causation Analysis: Chemical Exposure and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia**

Dear Mr. Schlichtmann:

I am writing to provide my expert medical opinion regarding the causal relationship between the chemical contamination of Woburn's municipal water supply and the development of acute lymphocytic leukemia in James Anderson, who died on January 18, 1981, at the age of twelve years. This opinion is based upon my review of medical records, environmental testing data, epidemiological studies, and toxicological literature, combined with my professional experience as a hematologist-oncologist specializing in pediatric leukemia for the past eighteen years.

## PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS

I received my medical degree from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1959, followed by residency training in internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. I completed fellowship training in hematology-oncology at the National Cancer Institute from 1964 to 1966. I have been board-certified in internal medicine and hematology since 1965. Currently, I serve as Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Chief of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. I have published over 120 peer-reviewed articles on leukemia causation and treatment, with particular focus on environmental factors in childhood malignancies. I have testified as an expert witness in seventeen cases involving occupational and environmental exposure to carcinogenic substances.

## CASE BACKGROUND AND EXPOSURE HISTORY

James Anderson was born on July 16, 1968, to Anne Anderson at 11 Orange Street, Woburn, Massachusetts. The Anderson residence received municipal water from Wells G and H throughout James's entire prenatal development and childhood. Well G opened in May 1964, and Well H began operation in October 1966. Environmental testing conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in May 1979 revealed significant contamination of both wells with industrial solvents, specifically trichloroethylene (TCE) at concentrations reaching 400 parts per billion and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) at 43 parts per billion.

James was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in January 1972 at age three years and seven months. His diagnosis followed a pattern consistent with other childhood leukemia cases in the East Woburn area, all of whom had consumed water from the contaminated municipal wells during critical developmental periods. The child underwent standard chemotherapy protocols for nine years before succumbing to his disease.

## TOXICOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

### Trichloroethylene (TCE) Exposure

Trichloroethylene is a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent classified as a probable human carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency. The concentrations found in Wells G and H (up to 400 ppb) represent levels 148 times higher than the EPA's cancer risk assessment threshold of 2.7 ppb for one additional cancer case per million exposed individuals. At the concentrations present in Woburn's water supply, the theoretical excess cancer risk approaches 148 cases per million exposed persons.

Recent epidemiological studies, including the work of Dr. Thomas Mancuso at the University of Pittsburgh, have demonstrated statistically significant associations between TCE exposure and hematopoietic malignancies. A 1981 study by Infante et al. published in the *Journal of Occupational Medicine* found a threefold increase in leukemia incidence among workers exposed to TCE in manufacturing facilities. While occupational exposures typically involve higher concentrations, the critical difference in childhood exposure is the increased vulnerability during periods of rapid cellular division and organ development.

### Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) Exposure

Tetrachloroethylene, present at 43 ppb in the Woburn wells, is another chlorinated solvent with demonstrated carcinogenic properties. Animal studies conducted by the National Cancer Institute have shown dose-dependent increases in leukemia and lymphoma in laboratory mice exposed to PCE. The mechanism of action appears to involve metabolic activation to reactive intermediates that can damage DNA and interfere with normal hematopoiesis.

### Synergistic Effects

The simultaneous exposure to multiple chlorinated solvents may produce synergistic carcinogenic effects that exceed the sum of individual chemical risks. This phenomenon, known as chemical interaction, is particularly relevant in the Woburn case where residents consumed water containing both TCE and PCE over extended periods.

## EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS

The cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn represents a statistically significant deviation from expected incidence rates. Based on national surveillance data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, the expected rate of acute lymphocytic leukemia in children ages 0-14 is approximately 3.2 cases per 100,000 person-years. The concentration of cases in the specific geographic area served by Wells G and H suggests an environmental etiology rather than random occurrence.

Of particular significance is the temporal relationship between well operation and disease onset. The contaminated wells began operation in 1964 and 1966, with peak contamination likely occurring in the early 1970s based on industrial disposal patterns. James Anderson and other affected children were exposed during critical periods of prenatal development and early childhood when hematopoietic tissues are most susceptible to carcinogenic insult.

## BIOLOGICAL PLAUSIBILITY

### Mechanism of Leukemogenesis

Chlorinated solvents such as TCE and PCE undergo metabolic transformation in the liver through cytochrome P-450 enzymes, producing reactive metabolites including chloroacetic acid derivatives and epoxide intermediates. These metabolites can:

1. **Direct DNA Damage**: Form covalent bonds with DNA bases, leading to mutations in critical genes controlling cellular growth and differentiation
2. **Chromosomal Aberrations**: Induce structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities commonly observed in acute lymphocytic leukemia
3. **Bone Marrow Toxicity**: Damage hematopoietic stem cells and alter the microenvironment necessary for normal blood cell development
4. **Immune System Suppression**: Compromise immune surveillance mechanisms that normally eliminate pre-malignant cells

### Developmental Vulnerability

Children represent a uniquely vulnerable population for several biological reasons:

- **Rapid Cell Division**: Higher rates of cellular proliferation increase opportunities for DNA damage to become fixed as mutations
- **Immature Detoxification**: Reduced capacity for metabolizing and eliminating toxic substances
- **Extended Exposure Time**: Longer potential lifespan allows more time for malignant transformation to occur
- **Critical Windows**: Certain developmental periods show heightened sensitivity to carcinogenic exposure

## CAUSATION ANALYSIS

### General Causation

The scientific literature supports a causal relationship between exposure to chlorinated solvents and the development of hematopoietic malignancies. This conclusion is based on:

1. **Consistency**: Multiple independent studies have reported associations between TCE/PCE exposure and leukemia
2. **Dose-Response**: Higher exposure levels correlate with increased cancer risk
3. **Temporal Relationship**: Appropriate latency periods between exposure and disease onset
4. **Biological Plausibility**: Established mechanisms for solvent-induced carcinogenesis
5. **Experimental Evidence**: Animal studies demonstrating carcinogenic effects

### Specific Causation - James Anderson

In the specific case of James Anderson, several factors support a causal relationship between chemical exposure and leukemia development:

**Exposure Certainty**: James consumed contaminated water from Wells G and H throughout his prenatal development and first three years of life, the period of highest vulnerability for leukemia induction.

**Temporal Consistency**: The latency period between initial exposure (prenatal/infancy) and diagnosis (age 3 years, 7 months) falls within the expected range for chemically-induced acute lymphoc
