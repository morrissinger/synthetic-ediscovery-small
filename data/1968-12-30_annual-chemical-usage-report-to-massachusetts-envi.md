## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 5C and DEQ Regulation 310 CMR 7.00, W.R. Grace Company hereby submits this Annual Chemical Usage Report for calendar year 1968 covering operations at our Cryovac Division manufacturing facility located at 112 Forest Street, Woburn, Massachusetts.

This facility manufactures specialized plastic food packaging materials and employs approximately 240 workers across three shifts. Our operations require the use of various industrial solvents and chemical compounds in the production process, waste treatment, and equipment maintenance activities. All chemical usage and disposal activities are conducted in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations as understood and interpreted by our technical staff.

## II. FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND OPERATIONS

The Woburn facility encompasses 15.2 acres and includes manufacturing buildings, administrative offices, maintenance shops, and associated support structures. Primary manufacturing operations involve the production of polyethylene and polyvinylidene chloride films used in food packaging applications. Secondary operations include equipment cleaning, maintenance activities, and waste processing.

The facility is situated within the Aberjona River watershed and overlies groundwater resources that flow generally in a southeasterly direction toward the Aberjona River. Site topography slopes gently toward the river, with surface elevations ranging from approximately 85 feet above mean sea level at the northern property boundary to 75 feet at the southern boundary.

## IV. WASTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

### A. Liquid Waste Disposal

Spent solvents and contaminated liquids generated during manufacturing operations are managed through the following methods:

1. **On-site Recovery Operations**: Approximately 15% of used solvents are processed through our distillation recovery system located in Building E. Recovered solvents meeting purity specifications are returned to production use.

2. **Off-site Disposal**: Non-recoverable liquid wastes are transported by licensed waste haulers to approved disposal facilities. Primary disposal contractor is Yankee Environmental Services, Inc. of Framingham, Massachusetts.

3. **Surface Impoundments**: Certain liquid wastes are temporarily stored in lined surface impoundments located in the southwestern portion of the facility property. These impoundments are designed with clay liners and are monitored for structural integrity.

### B. Solid Waste Management

Solid wastes containing chemical residues are segregated and disposed of through approved contractors. Approximately 145 tons of chemical-contaminated solid waste were generated during 1968 and transported to licensed disposal facilities in accordance with applicable regulations.

## V. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

### A. Groundwater Monitoring

The facility maintains two monitoring wells installed in 1967 to assess groundwater quality in the immediate vicinity of operations. Well locations are:

- **MW-1**: Located 150 feet southeast of Building C
- **MW-2**: Located 200 feet southwest of the surface impoundments

Quarterly sampling is conducted by Analytical Testing Corporation of Boston, Massachusetts. Parameters analyzed include pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and selected organic compounds as deemed appropriate by our technical staff.

### B. Surface Water Monitoring

Monthly visual inspections are conducted of surface water features adjacent to the facility, including drainage ditches and the nearby Aberjona River. No unusual conditions were observed during 1968 monitoring activities.

## VI. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

### A. Permits and Approvals

The facility operates under the following permits and approvals:

- **Air Quality Permit No. AQ-67-0834**: Issued June 15, 1967, covering emissions from manufacturing operations
- **Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit No. IW-66-1122**: Issued September 8, 1966, covering process wastewater discharges
- **Chemical Storage Permit No. CS-65-0445**: Issued March 12, 1965, covering underground storage tank systems

### B. Inspection History

The facility was inspected by DEQ personnel on March 14, 1968, and August 22, 1968. No violations were cited during these inspections. Minor recommendations regarding storage tank labeling and waste segregation procedures were addressed promptly by facility personnel.

## VII. PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS

### A. Storage System Upgrades

Plans are under development to upgrade certain underground storage systems with improved leak detection capabilities. These improvements are scheduled for implementation during the 1969-1970 timeframe, subject to capital budget approval.

### B. Waste Minimization Initiatives

The facility is evaluating opportunities to reduce chemical usage through process optimization and equipment modifications. A comprehensive waste minimization study is planned for 1969 to identify specific reduction opportunities.

## VIII. CERTIFICATION

I hereby certify that the information contained in this report is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief, based upon review of facility records and consultation with appropriate technical personnel.
