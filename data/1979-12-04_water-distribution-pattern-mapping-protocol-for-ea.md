## Abstract

This technical report establishes a comprehensive water distribution pattern mapping protocol for the East Woburn, Massachusetts municipal water system, with particular emphasis on Wells G and H service areas. The protocol is designed to facilitate epidemiological investigation of potential correlations between water supply patterns and reported health outcomes in the community. This methodology will enable precise determination of residential exposure pathways and duration of exposure to contaminated water sources during the operational period of Wells G and H (1964-1979).

## Introduction

Following the closure of municipal Wells G and H in May 1979 due to volatile organic compound contamination, the Centers for Disease Control has developed this standardized protocol to map historical water distribution patterns throughout East Woburn. This mapping exercise is essential for ongoing health investigations and will provide the foundation for exposure assessment studies currently being planned by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

The Woburn municipal water system operates through a complex network of distribution mains, with water sourced from multiple wells and treatment facilities. During the period 1964-1979, Wells G and H contributed significantly to the water supply serving eastern neighborhoods of Woburn, particularly residential areas in proximity to the Aberjona River Valley.

## Methodology

### Phase I: Infrastructure Documentation

**1. Distribution System Mapping**
- Obtain complete engineering drawings of water mains, service lines, and distribution infrastructure from Woburn Department of Public Works
- Document all valve locations, pressure zones, and flow direction indicators
- Map interconnections between different water sources within the distribution network
- Identify any cross-connections or emergency supply arrangements

**2. Well Operation Records**
- Collect daily pumping records for Wells G and H from 1964-1979
- Document seasonal variations in well usage and capacity
- Identify periods of peak demand and corresponding well activation patterns
- Correlate pumping data with municipal consumption records

### Phase II: Service Area Delineation

**3. Hydraulic Analysis**
- Conduct hydraulic modeling to determine primary service areas for Wells G and H
- Account for pressure differentials and flow patterns under varying demand conditions
- Map areas receiving water exclusively from Wells G and H versus mixed sources
- Document temporal variations in service patterns based on operational data

**4. Residence-Specific Water Source Assessment**
- Survey individual properties to determine primary water source during 1964-1979 period
- Document any private wells or alternative water sources
- Map residential density patterns within identified service areas
- Correlate addresses with known health outcomes of interest

### Phase III: Temporal Analysis

**5. Historical Usage Patterns**
- Analyze seasonal variations in Wells G and H operation
- Document any periods of reduced operation or maintenance shutdowns
- Correlate usage patterns with industrial activity levels in surrounding area
- Map changes in service area boundaries over the 15-year operational period

## Site Description

The study area encompasses approximately 3.2 square miles of East Woburn, bounded by the Aberjona River to the west, Route 38 to the east, and extending from the Wilmington town line south to approximately Montvale Avenue. This area includes predominantly residential neighborhoods with scattered commercial properties and light industrial facilities.

**Key Geographic Features:**
- Aberjona River Valley trench running north-south through western portion
- Residential neighborhoods: Pine Street area, East Woburn center, Montvale area
- Industrial sites: W.R. Grace/Cryovac facility (369 Washington Street), John J. Riley tannery (228 Salem Street)
- Municipal infrastructure: Wells G and H locations, primary distribution mains

**Hydrogeologic Characteristics:**
- Glacial outwash deposits underlying much of study area
- Shallow groundwater table (5-15 feet below surface)
- Generally eastward groundwater flow toward Aberjona River
- Permeable soils facilitating rapid contaminant migration

## Data Collection Procedures

### Field Survey Requirements

**Equipment Needed:**
- Engineering-grade survey equipment for precise location mapping
- Water pressure gauges for hydraulic measurements
- Flow meters for distribution system analysis
- Sampling equipment for water quality verification
- Documentation materials including standardized forms and mapping supplies

**Personnel Requirements:**
- Licensed professional engineer familiar with municipal water systems
- Environmental technician trained in field sampling procedures
- Survey crew for precise location mapping
- Administrative support for records compilation and data management

### Quality Assurance Measures

**Data Verification:**
- Cross-reference municipal records with independent sources where available
- Conduct field verification of critical infrastructure locations
- Implement duplicate sampling procedures for water quality measurements
- Maintain chain of custody documentation for all samples collected

**Documentation Standards:**
- All field observations recorded on standardized forms
- Photographic documentation of key infrastructure elements
- GPS coordinates recorded for all sampling locations and infrastructure features
- Daily field reports submitted to project coordinator

## Findings and Preliminary Observations

Based on initial records review and preliminary field reconnaissance, the following observations have been documented:

**Distribution System Configuration:**
Wells G and H were integrated into the municipal distribution system through 12-inch diameter transmission mains connecting to the primary distribution network at Washington Street and Salem Street respectively. During peak demand periods (typically summer months), these wells provided an estimated 35-40% of total municipal water supply to the eastern service area.

**Service Area Demographics:**
Preliminary analysis indicates that Wells G and H primarily served approximately 450 residential properties housing an estimated 1,800 residents during the peak operational period (1970-1975). This population includes numerous families with children born during or shortly before the operational period of these wells.

**Operational Patterns:**
Wells G and H operated on an alternating schedule during normal demand periods, with both wells operating simultaneously during peak demand. Well G typically operated 12-16 hours per day during average demand periods, while Well H operated 8-12 hours per day. During summer months and periods of high demand, both wells operated continuously.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The water distribution pattern mapping protocol outlined in this report will provide essential data for ongoing epidemiological investigations in East Woburn. The methodology addresses the complex nature of municipal water distribution systems and accounts for temporal variations in service patterns that may be critical for exposure assessment.

**Immediate Recommendations:**

1. **Expedite Phase I Implementation:** Begin infrastructure documentation immediately to preserve institutional knowledge while municipal personnel familiar with historical operations remain available.

2. **Coordinate with Ongoing Investigations:** Ensure that mapping activities complement rather than interfere with environmental sampling and remediation activities currently underway.

3. **Establish Resident Communication Protocol:** Develop standardized procedures for communicating with residents during door-to-door surveys to ensure cooperation while maintaining confidentiality of health information.

4. **Preserve Historical Records:** Implement measures to prevent loss or destruction of municipal records that may be essential for future legal or regulatory proceedings.

**Long-term Recommendations:**

1. **Develop Exposure Assessment Model:** Utilize mapping data to create quantitative exposure models for individual residences based on duration of residence and water consumption patterns.

2. **Integrate with Health Outcome Data:** Coordinate with Massachusetts Department of Public Health to correlate water distribution patterns with reported health outcomes in the community.

3. **Monitor Remediation Effectiveness:** Establish baseline conditions for ongoing monitoring of remediation activities at identified contamination sources.

**Resource Requirements:**

Implementation of this protocol will require approximately 120 person-hours of professional engineering time, 200 person-hours of field technician time, and 80 person-hours of administrative support over a six-week period. Estimated total cost including equipment, materials, and personnel is $24,500.

**Timeline:**

- Phase I completion: 3 weeks from initiation
- Phase II completion: 2 weeks following Phase I
- Phase III completion: 1 week following Phase II
- Final report preparation: 2 weeks following field work completion

This protocol represents a critical component of the comprehensive environmental health investigation being conducted in East Woburn and will provide essential data for determining the extent and nature of community exposure to contaminated water supplies.
