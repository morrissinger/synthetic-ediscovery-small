## Executive Summary

This technical analysis documents the historical waste disposal practices at the John J. Riley Company tannery facility located at 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts, owned by Beatrice Foods Inc. since 1978. The assessment covers the period from 1964 through 1979, corresponding to the operational timeline of municipal Wells G and H. This documentation has been prepared in response to EPA inquiries regarding potential groundwater contamination sources in the Aberjona River Valley and includes an inventory of chemical waste containers, disposal methodologies, and historical waste management practices at the facility.

The Riley tannery operation utilized various chemical solvents and processing agents typical of leather manufacturing operations during this period. Primary chemicals included chromium compounds for tanning processes, organic solvents for degreasing operations, and various acids and bases for pH adjustment. Waste disposal practices evolved throughout the assessment period, initially following industry standards prevalent in the 1960s and subsequently adapting to emerging environmental regulations.

## Site Description and Operational Context

The John J. Riley Company facility encompasses approximately 3.2 acres of the larger 14.73-acre property owned by Beatrice Foods Inc. The tannery building, constructed in 1952, houses leather processing equipment including rotating drums for tanning operations, chemical storage tanks, and wastewater treatment systems. The facility is situated approximately 1,200 feet southwest of municipal Wells G and H, within the Aberjona River Valley groundwater recharge area.

Historical production records indicate the facility processed an average of 2,400 hides per month during peak operational periods between 1965 and 1975. Leather processing operations required substantial quantities of water (approximately 15,000 gallons per day) and generated corresponding volumes of chemical wastewater containing dissolved chromium, organic matter, and residual processing chemicals.

## Chemical Inventory and Usage Patterns

### Primary Processing Chemicals (1964-1979)

**Chromium Compounds:**
- Basic chromium sulfate: 180-220 drums annually (55-gallon capacity)
- Chromium chloride solutions: 45-60 drums annually
- Total chromium usage: approximately 12,000 pounds annually

**Organic Solvents:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 24-36 drums annually for degreasing operations
- Perchloroethylene (PCE): 12-18 drums annually for spot cleaning
- Methylene chloride: 6-12 drums annually for specialized cleaning

**Processing Acids and Bases:**
- Sulfuric acid (concentrated): 48-60 drums annually
- Formic acid: 24-36 drums annually
- Sodium hydroxide: 36-48 drums annually

### Chemical Storage and Handling Protocols

Chemical storage areas were established in three locations within the facility: the main processing floor (Area A), the exterior storage yard (Area B), and the basement storage room (Area C). Area A housed active-use chemicals in quantities sufficient for 30-day operations. Area B served as primary storage for bulk chemical deliveries, with concrete pad construction and basic weather protection. Area C provided temperature-controlled storage for specialized chemicals requiring climate control.

Container inspection protocols during the assessment period followed industry standards established by the National Association of Leather Manufacturers. Visual inspections occurred monthly, with documentation maintained in facility logbooks. Container rotation followed first-in, first-out inventory management to minimize storage duration and reduce container degradation risks.

## Waste Disposal Practices and Container Management

### Historical Disposal Methodologies (1964-1975)

During the initial operational period, waste disposal practices reflected industry standards prevalent throughout Massachusetts manufacturing facilities. Empty chemical containers underwent triple-rinsing procedures using facility process water, with rinse water directed to the facility's wastewater treatment system. Rinsed containers were either returned to chemical suppliers for refurbishment or disposed of through licensed waste hauling contractors.

Liquid chemical wastes generated during processing operations were managed through the facility's primary wastewater treatment system, consisting of chromium precipitation tanks, settling basins, and pH adjustment systems. Treated effluent was discharged to the Aberjona River under Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering permits issued in 1965 and renewed in 1970.

Solid waste materials, including leather trimmings, sludge from wastewater treatment operations, and general facility waste, were collected by municipal waste services or transported to approved disposal sites. Chemical-contaminated solid wastes were segregated and managed through specialized waste contractors beginning in 1972.

### Container Assessment and Disposal Documentation (1975-1979)

Enhanced container management protocols were implemented beginning in 1975 in response to emerging federal environmental regulations. Container inspection frequency increased to bi-weekly intervals, with detailed documentation of container condition, contents, and disposal methods. A comprehensive container tracking system was established to maintain chain-of-custody documentation for regulatory compliance purposes.

**Container Disposal Summary (1975-1979):**
- Total containers processed: 1,847 units
- Returned to suppliers for refurbishment: 1,203 units (65.1%)
- Disposed through licensed waste contractors: 644 units (34.9%)
- Container failures requiring emergency response: 12 incidents

Emergency response procedures were established for container failures, including immediate containment of spilled materials, notification of appropriate regulatory agencies, and engagement of specialized cleanup contractors. All emergency incidents were documented with detailed incident reports maintained in facility files.

## Groundwater Monitoring and Environmental Compliance

### Monitoring Well Installation and Testing

In response to Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering requirements, three groundwater monitoring wells were installed on the facility property in 1977. Wells MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3 were positioned to monitor groundwater quality upgradient and downgradient of primary chemical storage and waste treatment areas.

Quarterly groundwater sampling was conducted beginning in January 1978, with samples analyzed for chromium, pH, total dissolved solids, and biochemical oxygen demand. Additional volatile organic compound analysis was initiated in 1979 following EPA guidance for facilities utilizing chlorinated solvents.

**Monitoring Results Summary (1978-1979):**
- Chromium concentrations: 0.02-0.15 mg/L (below 0.5 mg/L standard)
- pH values: 6.8-7.4 (within acceptable range)
- Volatile organic compounds: Below detection limits in all samples
- No exceedances of applicable groundwater quality standards

### Regulatory Compliance Assessment

Facility operations maintained compliance with applicable federal and state environmental regulations throughout the assessment period. Required permits were obtained and renewed according to regulatory schedules, and all monitoring and reporting requirements were fulfilled according to permit conditions.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) interim status notification was submitted to EPA in February 1980, identifying the facility as a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. Waste characterization studies confirmed that facility-generated wastes met small quantity generator criteria, with monthly generation volumes consistently below 1,000 kilograms.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

This comprehensive assessment of chemical waste container management and disposal practices at the John J. Riley Company facility demonstrates adherence to industry standards and regulatory requirements throughout the operational period corresponding to Wells G and H operation. Container management protocols evolved to incorporate enhanced environmental protection measures as regulatory frameworks developed during the 1970s.

Groundwater monitoring data indicates no evidence of facility-related contamination of local groundwater resources. Chemical usage patterns and waste disposal methodologies were consistent with accepted practices for leather manufacturing operations during the assessment period.
