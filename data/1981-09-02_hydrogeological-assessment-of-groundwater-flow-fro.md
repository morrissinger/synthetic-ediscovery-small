## Executive Summary

This hydrogeological assessment examines the groundwater flow patterns and potential contaminant transport pathways from industrial facilities in East Woburn, Massachusetts to municipal Wells G and H. Based on comprehensive analysis of geological data, groundwater monitoring results, and hydraulic modeling, this report establishes the hydrogeological connection between identified industrial sources and the contaminated municipal water supply wells.

The investigation demonstrates that groundwater flow in the study area follows predictable patterns consistent with the regional hydrogeology, creating direct hydraulic pathways from industrial disposal areas to the municipal wells. Contaminant transport modeling indicates that chlorinated solvents released at industrial sites would reach Wells G and H within timeframes consistent with observed contamination patterns.

## Introduction

Wells G and H, operated by the City of Woburn, began service in 1964 and 1966 respectively, providing municipal water to residents of East Woburn. In May 1979, these wells were closed following detection of trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) contamination. Subsequent investigations have identified multiple potential industrial sources of these contaminants in the vicinity of the wells.

This hydrogeological assessment was commissioned to evaluate the groundwater flow regime and contaminant transport pathways between identified industrial facilities and the municipal wells. The analysis focuses on establishing the scientific basis for understanding how industrial chemicals released to the subsurface could migrate through groundwater to contaminate the municipal water supply.

## Site Description and Geology

### Regional Setting

The study area is located in the Aberjona River valley in East Woburn, Massachusetts. The regional topography consists of low-lying areas along the Aberjona River with surrounding hills composed of glacial deposits and bedrock. The valley contains significant deposits of glacial outwash and alluvium that form the primary aquifer system.

### Geological Framework

The subsurface geology consists of the following units, from surface to depth:

**Surficial Deposits:**
- Fill material (0-5 feet): Variable composition including sand, gravel, and debris
- Organic deposits (0-8 feet): Peat and organic-rich sediments in wetland areas
- Glacial outwash (10-60 feet): Sand and gravel deposits with high permeability

**Glacial Till:**
- Dense, low-permeability clay-rich till overlying bedrock
- Thickness varies from 0-20 feet
- Acts as confining layer where present

**Bedrock:**
- Paleozoic metamorphic rocks
- Fractured zones provide secondary permeability
- Generally encountered at depths of 40-80 feet

### Aquifer Characteristics

The primary aquifer consists of glacial outwash deposits with hydraulic conductivity values ranging from 10^-3 to 10^-2 cm/sec. Porosity values range from 25-35%. The aquifer is generally unconfined, with localized semi-confined conditions where till deposits are present.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

This assessment is based on analysis of:
- Existing well logs and boring records from municipal and private wells
- Water level measurements from monitoring wells and municipal wells
- Geological mapping and outcrop observations
- Historical aerial photographs and land use records
- Industrial facility records and reported chemical usage

### Hydraulic Analysis

Groundwater flow direction and magnitude were determined through:
- Construction of potentiometric surface maps based on water level measurements
- Calculation of hydraulic gradients and flow velocities
- Application of Darcy's Law for groundwater flow analysis

### Contaminant Transport Modeling

Contaminant migration pathways were evaluated using:
- Advective transport calculations based on groundwater flow velocities
- Consideration of dispersion and dilution effects
- Evaluation of retardation factors for chlorinated solvents in aquifer materials

## Findings

### Groundwater Flow Patterns

Analysis of water level data reveals a consistent groundwater flow pattern from northwest to southeast, following the general topographic gradient toward the Aberjona River. The potentiometric surface indicates flow convergence in the vicinity of Wells G and H, which created a cone of depression during pumping operations.

**Key Hydraulic Parameters:**
- Average hydraulic gradient: 0.003-0.008 ft/ft
- Estimated groundwater velocity: 0.5-2.0 feet/day
- Pumping rates: Well G (400 gpm), Well H (300 gpm)

### Industrial Source Areas

Three primary industrial areas have been identified upgradient of Wells G and H:

**W.R. Grace Property (Cryovac Division):**
- Located approximately 1,500 feet northwest of Well H
- Historical use of TCE and other solvents for manufacturing processes
- Direct hydraulic connection to well field demonstrated

**Beatrice Foods Property:**
- Located approximately 2,000 feet north-northeast of Wells G and H
- Former Riley Tannery operations with documented solvent disposal
- Groundwater flow path intersects well capture zones

**Adjacent Industrial Parcels:**
- Multiple smaller facilities with potential solvent usage
- Cumulative impact on groundwater quality in well vicinity

### Contaminant Transport Analysis

Transport modeling indicates that contaminants released at industrial source areas would reach Wells G and H through the following mechanisms:

**Advective Transport:**
- Primary mechanism for contaminant migration
- Travel times: 2-8 years from identified source areas to wells
- Consistent with observed contamination timeline (wells opened 1964-1966, contamination detected 1979)

**Well Capture Zones:**
- During pumping operations, Wells G and H created overlapping capture zones extending northwest toward industrial areas
- Estimated capture zone radius: 1,500-2,500 feet under pumping conditions
- All identified source areas fall within or upgradient of capture zones

### Contamination Concentrations

Available data from well sampling indicates:
- TCE concentrations up to 400 parts per billion in Well G
- PCE concentrations up to 43 parts per billion in Well H
- Concentration patterns consistent with multiple source contributions
- Temporal variations reflecting operational changes at source facilities

## Analysis and Conclusions

### Hydrogeological Connection

The hydrogeological evidence establishes clear pathways for contaminant migration from industrial source areas to Wells G and H:

1. **Hydraulic Continuity:** The glacial outwash aquifer provides direct hydraulic connection between source areas and wells with no significant barriers to groundwater flow.

2. **Flow Direction:** Consistent groundwater flow from industrial areas toward the well field creates the necessary driving force for contaminant transport.

3. **Capture Zone Analysis:** Well pumping operations created capture zones that encompassed the identified industrial source areas, drawing contaminated groundwater toward the wells.

4. **Transport Timing:** Calculated travel times (2-8 years) are consistent with the observed timeline of well operation and contamination detection.

### Contaminant Source Attribution

The spatial distribution of contamination and groundwater flow patterns indicate:

- Multiple industrial sources contributed to well contamination
- Primary source areas include W.R. Grace/Cryovac and former Riley Tannery properties
- Concentration patterns reflect varying source strengths and distances
- Temporal variations consistent with changing industrial operations

### Implications for Water Supply

The hydrogeological analysis demonstrates that:

- Industrial solvent disposal practices directly impacted municipal water quality
- Well G and H were hydraulically connected to contamination sources throughout their operational period (1964-1979)
- Residents served by these wells were exposed to contaminated water for up to 15 years
- The aquifer system's characteristics facilitated rapid contaminant transport with minimal natural attenuation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Continued Well Closure:** Wells G and H should remain closed until contamination levels decrease to acceptable standards.

2. **Source Control:** Industrial facilities should implement immediate measures to prevent further contaminant releases to groundwater.

3. **Monitoring Network
