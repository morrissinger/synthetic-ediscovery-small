# Birth Announcement Letter

**October 15, 1968**

Dear Family,

Kevin and I are overjoyed to share the wonderful news that our precious son, **Kevin Kane Jr.**, was born on October 12th at 3:47 AM at Winchester Hospital. He weighed 7 pounds, 3 ounces and measured 20 inches long - a perfect little angel with the most beautiful dark hair and his father's strong chin already showing!

The delivery went smoothly, though it was quite an adventure getting to the hospital in the middle of the night. Kevin was so nervous he nearly forgot to grab my suitcase! Dr. Morrison was wonderful throughout the entire process, and the nurses at Winchester have been absolutely marvelous. Little Kevin Jr. is healthy and strong, with good lungs - believe me, we know because he's been exercising them quite regularly! He's nursing well and seems to have settled into a routine already, sleeping for longer stretches during the day and keeping us company at night.

We've been so blessed during this time, and I can't help but feel grateful for our beautiful home here in East Woburn and the wonderful community we're part of. The neighbors have been incredibly kind - Mrs. Henderson from next door brought over a casserole yesterday, and the Andersons from down Pine Street stopped by with the most beautiful blanket that Mrs. Anderson knitted herself. It's such a comfort knowing we're surrounded by caring friends and neighbors as we begin this new chapter of our lives.

Kevin is absolutely smitten with his namesake and has been such a devoted father already, taking the night feedings in stride and insisting on changing every diaper - though I suspect that enthusiasm might wear off in a few weeks! He's been working extra shifts at the plant to make sure we have everything we need for the baby, and his supervisor has been very understanding about the new arrival. We feel so fortunate that Kevin has steady work and good benefits, especially with the little one to think about now.

The nursery is finally finished - we painted it a soft yellow since we wanted to be surprised about whether we were having a boy or girl. Kevin built the most beautiful crib with his own hands, sanding it until it was smooth as silk. We've set it up right next to our bedroom window where the morning light comes in so gently. Little Kevin Jr. seems to love lying there in the mornings, looking up at the mobile that Aunt Rose sent from Chicago with the little airplanes and cars.

We're planning to have him baptized at St. Charles Church next month, and of course we hope all of you can make it to Woburn for the celebration. Father McKenna has been so welcoming, and the parish community has embraced us completely since we moved to Pine Street three years ago. We're thinking November 17th would be perfect - not too close to Thanksgiving but giving everyone time to make arrangements.

Please give our love to everyone, and tell them how much we're looking forward to introducing little Kevin Jr. to his extended family. He's already got quite the personality - very alert and seems to study everything around him with those bright eyes. Kevin swears he smiled at him yesterday, though I told him it was probably just gas! Either way, our hearts are completely full.

We can't wait for you all to meet our perfect little boy. The house feels so different now, filled with new sounds and new purpose. Every day brings something new to discover about this little person who has already changed our lives so completely.

With all our love and excitement,

Patricia, Kevin, and Kevin Jr.

**P.S.** - Our address is still 12 Pine Street, Woburn, MA 01801, and our phone number is 617-933-4782 if you need to reach us. The baby's birth certificate lists his full name as Kevin Michael Kane Jr., born October 12, 1968, in Winchester, Massachusetts.
