# Wells G and H Service Area Cancer Cluster Investigation Report

**Prepared by:** CDC Statistical Analysis Unit  
**Report Date:** July 1, 1980  
**Classification:** Confidential - Health Investigation  
**Distribution:** Massachusetts Department of Public Health, EPA Region I

## Executive Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has completed a comprehensive epidemiological investigation of childhood leukemia incidence in the Wells G and H service area of East Woburn, Massachusetts, covering the period from 1964 to 1980. This investigation was initiated following the closure of municipal Wells G and H in May 1979 due to volatile organic compound contamination and subsequent community concerns regarding elevated childhood cancer rates.

**Key Findings:**
- Statistically significant elevation in childhood leukemia incidence within the Wells G and H service area
- Six confirmed cases of childhood leukemia in a population where 0.7 cases would be expected
- Relative risk of 8.6 (95% CI: 3.2-18.7) for childhood leukemia in the affected service area
- Strong temporal correlation between well operation periods and disease onset

## Introduction and Background

Wells G and H operated as supplemental municipal water sources for East Woburn from 1964 and 1966 respectively until their closure in May 1979. These wells served approximately 5,000 residents in the eastern section of Woburn, providing water through a distribution system that included Pine Street, Salem Street, and adjacent residential areas.

In May 1979, routine testing conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health detected significant concentrations of volatile organic compounds in both wells, including trichloroethylene (TCE) at 267 parts per billion in Well G and 21.4 parts per billion in Well H. Additional contaminants identified included tetrachloroethylene, chloroform, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.

Following well closure, community members organized by resident Anne Anderson approached health authorities with concerns about what appeared to be an unusual number of childhood leukemia cases in their neighborhood. This prompted the current epidemiological investigation.

## Methodology

### Study Population
The study population consisted of all children under age 15 residing in the Wells G and H service area during the period 1964-1980. Service area boundaries were determined through analysis of water distribution records and hydraulic modeling conducted by engineering consultants.

### Case Definition
Cases were defined as children diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) while residing in the study area. Cases were identified through:
- Massachusetts Cancer Registry records
- Hospital discharge records from area medical facilities
- Physician reports to the Department of Public Health
- Community reporting through the Anderson family network

### Statistical Analysis
Expected case numbers were calculated using Massachusetts state incidence rates for childhood leukemia, adjusted for age and gender distribution of the study population. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Poisson distribution assumptions.

## Findings

### Demographic Characteristics
The Wells G and H service area population during the study period averaged 5,200 residents, with approximately 1,100 children under age 15. The population was predominantly white (97.2%) and middle-class, with median household income slightly above the Massachusetts average.

### Case Identification
Six confirmed cases of childhood leukemia were identified in the study area:

1. **James Anderson** - Male, diagnosed age 3 (1972), acute lymphocytic leukemia
2. **Kevin Kane Jr.** - Male, diagnosed age 2 (1973), acute lymphocytic leukemia  
3. **Michael Zona** - Male, diagnosed age 6 (1974), acute lymphocytic leukemia
4. **Patrick Toomey** - Male, diagnosed age 7 (1976), acute lymphocytic leukemia
5. **Carl Robbins III** - Male, diagnosed age 4 (1978), acute lymphocytic leukemia
6. **Roland Gamache** - Male, diagnosed age 5 (1979), acute lymphocytic leukemia

All cases were acute lymphocytic leukemia. Five of six cases were fatal; one patient (Roland Gamache) remains in treatment.

### Statistical Analysis Results

**Expected vs. Observed Cases:**
- Expected cases (1964-1980): 0.7 cases
- Observed cases: 6 cases
- Standardized Incidence Ratio: 8.6 (95% CI: 3.2-18.7)
- P-value: <0.001

**Temporal Distribution:**
The temporal pattern shows clustering of diagnoses between 1972-1979, with peak incidence during 1973-1976. This corresponds to a period 8-12 years after initial well operation, consistent with known latency periods for chemically-induced leukemia.

**Geographic Distribution:**
Cases clustered along Pine Street, Salem Street, and Olympia Avenue, areas receiving the highest proportion of Wells G and H water based on hydraulic modeling. The median distance from case residences to the nearest well was 0.8 miles.

### Environmental Correlation Analysis

Water consumption patterns were reconstructed using municipal records and household surveys. Families of affected children reported higher than average water consumption during relevant exposure periods, with four families specifically noting increased water usage due to home swimming pools filled with municipal water.

Chemical analysis of archived water samples (where available) showed:
- TCE concentrations ranging from 15-267 ppb
- Tetrachloroethylene: 5-48 ppb  
- Chloroform: 12-87 ppb
- 1,1,1-trichloroethane: 8-23 ppb

These levels significantly exceed current EPA drinking water standards and were present throughout the operational period of both wells.

## Discussion

The epidemiological evidence demonstrates a statistically significant cluster of childhood leukemia in the Wells G and H service area during the period of well operation. The magnitude of risk elevation (SIR = 8.6) is substantial and highly unlikely to occur by chance alone (p < 0.001).

Several factors support a causal relationship between water contamination and leukemia incidence:

1. **Temporal Relationship:** Disease onset follows a biologically plausible latency period after exposure initiation
2. **Dose-Response:** Higher consumption families show earlier onset and more severe disease progression
3. **Geographic Clustering:** Cases concentrate in areas receiving the highest proportion of contaminated water
4. **Biological Plausibility:** TCE and related compounds are known hematotoxins with leukemogenic potential in animal studies

### Limitations

This investigation has several limitations that should be acknowledged:
- Small sample size limits statistical power for subgroup analyses
- Retrospective exposure assessment relies on modeling and recall
- Potential for reporting bias following community awareness of the cluster
- Limited availability of archived water samples for exposure verification

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The epidemiological evidence strongly suggests that volatile organic compound contamination of Wells G and H contributed to elevated childhood leukemia incidence in East Woburn. The magnitude and consistency of the association, combined with biological plausibility and temporal relationships, support a causal inference.

### Immediate Recommendations:

1. **Medical Surveillance:** Establish long-term medical monitoring for all residents of the affected area, with particular attention to children exposed during critical developmental periods

2. **Environmental Remediation:** Conduct comprehensive groundwater assessment to identify contamination sources and implement remediation measures

3. **Public Health Response:** Develop community health education programs and ensure access to specialized medical care for affected families

4. **Regulatory Action:** Recommend EPA investigation of potential responsible parties for contamination and enforcement of environmental regulations

### Long-term Monitoring:

Continue epidemiological surveillance for at least 10 years to identify any additional cases and monitor long-term health outcomes in the exposed population.
