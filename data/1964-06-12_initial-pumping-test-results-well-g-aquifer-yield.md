# TECHNICAL REPORT
## Initial Pumping Test Results Well G Aquifer Yield Assessment

**TO:** Thomas J. Sullivan, Director, Department of Public Works  
**FROM:** Robert F. McCarthy, City Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** June 12, 1964  
**RE:** Well G Initial Testing and Aquifer Performance Analysis

---

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of initial pumping tests conducted on Well G from June 8-11, 1964, following completion of drilling operations and installation of pumping equipment. The well demonstrates satisfactory yield capacity for supplemental municipal water supply purposes, with sustained pumping rates meeting design specifications. Aquifer characteristics indicate good long-term sustainability for the intended operational profile.

### WELL SPECIFICATIONS AND LOCATION

**Well Designation:** Well G  
**Location:** Eastern Woburn, approximately 400 feet northeast of Aberjona River  
**Coordinates:** 42°29'15"N, 71°08'42"W  
**Total Depth:** 88 feet  
**Casing Diameter:** 12 inches (steel casing to 65 feet)  
**Screen Interval:** 65-88 feet (stainless steel well screen)  
**Static Water Level:** 22.5 feet below ground surface  
**Ground Elevation:** 42 feet above mean sea level

### TESTING METHODOLOGY

Pumping tests were conducted using a Goulds Model 3196 centrifugal pump rated at 500 gallons per minute maximum capacity. Water levels were monitored using a Solinst steel tape water level indicator with accuracy to 0.01 feet. Testing protocol followed Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines for municipal water supply wells.

**Test Schedule:**
- **Step-drawdown test:** June 8, 1964 (4 hours duration)
- **Constant rate test:** June 9-10, 1964 (24 hours duration)
- **Recovery test:** June 11, 1964 (12 hours monitoring)

### PUMPING TEST RESULTS

#### Step-Drawdown Test Results
| Pumping Rate (GPM) | Duration (Hours) | Drawdown (Feet) | Specific Capacity (GPM/ft) |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 125               | 1.0              | 3.2             | 39.1                      |
| 250               | 1.0              | 7.8             | 32.1                      |
| 375               | 1.0              | 14.5            | 25.9                      |
| 450               | 1.0              | 21.8            | 20.6                      |

#### Constant Rate Test (450 GPM)
- **Initial drawdown:** 21.8 feet at 5 minutes
- **Stabilized drawdown:** 24.3 feet at 12 hours
- **Final drawdown:** 24.7 feet at 24 hours
- **Specific capacity:** 18.2 GPM per foot of drawdown

#### Aquifer Properties (Calculated)
- **Transmissivity:** 8,500 gallons per day per foot
- **Storage coefficient:** 0.0003 (confined aquifer conditions)
- **Hydraulic conductivity:** 142 gallons per day per square foot

### WATER QUALITY OBSERVATIONS

Initial water samples collected during pumping operations appeared clear and colorless. Water temperature remained steady at 52°F throughout testing period. No unusual odors or visible contamination observed during pumping operations. Formal bacteriological and chemical analysis samples have been submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory in Jamaica Plain for routine municipal water supply certification testing, with results expected within 10-14 days.

### OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on testing results, Well G demonstrates adequate capacity to serve as a supplemental water source for the City of Woburn municipal system. The following operational parameters are recommended:

**Recommended Operating Conditions:**
- **Maximum continuous pumping rate:** 400 GPM
- **Normal operating range:** 250-350 GPM
- **Maximum daily production:** 500,000 gallons
- **Recommended pump setting:** 45 feet below ground surface

The aquifer shows excellent recovery characteristics, with water levels returning to within 95% of static levels within 6 hours of pump shutdown. This indicates good aquifer connectivity and sustainable yield potential.

### SYSTEM INTEGRATION

Well G has been connected to the municipal distribution system via 12-inch ductile iron main extending 1,200 feet to the intersection of Salem Street and Main Street (Route 38). The well will primarily serve residential areas in East Woburn, including neighborhoods along Salem Street, Montvale Avenue, and Cross Street. Integration with existing Wells A, B, and C will provide operational flexibility and redundancy for the growing water demands of our 35,000 residents.

**Distribution Service Area:**
- Primary: East Woburn residential district
- Secondary: Industrial facilities along Olympia Avenue
- Emergency: Backup supply for central Woburn during peak demand periods

### MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

**Monthly monitoring requirements:**
- Water level measurements
- Pumping rate verification
- Motor amperage and voltage readings
- Visual inspection of wellhead and pump house

**Quarterly requirements:**
- Bacteriological sampling per state regulations
- Chemical analysis for standard parameters
- Pump performance evaluation

**Annual requirements:**
- Comprehensive water quality analysis
- Well video inspection
- Pump maintenance and calibration

### CONCLUSION

Well G testing results demonstrate successful completion of a high-yield municipal water supply well suitable for long-term operation. The aquifer characteristics indicate sustainable production capacity that will adequately serve the supplemental water supply needs of East Woburn. The well is ready for integration into regular municipal water system operations pending receipt of satisfactory water quality test results from the state laboratory.

This new water source represents a significant enhancement to Woburn's municipal water supply infrastructure, providing increased capacity and operational flexibility to meet the growing needs of our community. The well's location in the eastern section of the city will improve water pressure and service reliability for residents in that area while reducing demand on our existing well system.
