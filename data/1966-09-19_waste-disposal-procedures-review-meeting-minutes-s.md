# MEETING MINUTES
## Waste Disposal Procedures Review Committee

**Date:** September 19, 1966  
**Time:** 3:30 PM - 5:15 PM  
**Location:** Conference Room B, Cryovac Manufacturing Facility  
**Address:** 15 Olympia Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts

### ATTENDEES

**Present:**
- Robert J. Hartwell, Operations Manager (Chair)
- Frank Morrison, Production Supervisor - Line A
- Charles Brennan, Production Supervisor - Line B  
- William Tessier, Maintenance Supervisor
- Dorothy Kemp, Quality Control Supervisor
- James Sullivan, Safety Officer
- Richard Phelps, Plant Engineer

**Absent:**
- Thomas McKenna, Environmental Compliance Officer (attending regional conference)

### AGENDA ITEMS DISCUSSED

#### 1. Current Waste Stream Analysis

Mr. Hartwell opened the meeting by reviewing the monthly waste disposal report for August 1966. Current production levels are generating approximately 2,400 gallons per week of solvent waste, primarily consisting of trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and associated cleaning compounds used in the plastic film manufacturing process.

Mr. Phelps reported that the existing lagoon system on the eastern portion of our property continues to operate within designed parameters. The three settling ponds, constructed in 1964, are effectively separating solids from liquid waste streams before discharge. Water table monitoring conducted in July showed levels consistent with seasonal variations.

#### 2. Disposal Cost Optimization

Ms. Kemp presented cost analysis data comparing current disposal methods with potential alternatives:

- **Current Method (Lagoon System):** $0.12 per gallon processed
- **Off-site Disposal (Proposed):** $2.85 per gallon transported
- **Incineration (Estimated):** $1.75 per gallon processed

The committee agreed that the current lagoon system represents the most economical solution for our waste management needs. Mr. Morrison noted that production schedules require rapid turnaround of cleaning operations, making on-site disposal essential for maintaining efficiency targets.

#### 3. Regulatory Compliance Review

Mr. Sullivan reported that our current disposal practices remain in compliance with all applicable Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations. The most recent inspection, conducted on June 15, 1966, resulted in no citations or required modifications to our procedures.

Discussion centered on upcoming federal environmental legislation that may impact industrial waste disposal practices. Mr. Hartwell emphasized the importance of maintaining cost-effective operations while meeting all regulatory requirements.

#### 4. Maintenance and Operational Procedures

Mr. Tessier provided updates on lagoon maintenance activities:

- **Pond 1:** Sediment removal completed August 12, capacity restored to 95%
- **Pond 2:** Operating normally, scheduled for cleaning October 1966
- **Pond 3:** New overflow pipe installed, drainage improved

The committee reviewed standard operating procedures for waste handling. All production supervisors confirmed that their crews continue to follow established protocols for solvent disposal and equipment cleaning.

#### 5. Safety Considerations

Mr. Sullivan presented the quarterly safety report related to waste handling operations. No incidents were reported during the July-September period. Safety equipment inventory remains adequate, with additional ventilation fans installed in the mixing areas per his recommendations.

Discussion included proper personal protective equipment requirements for employees working near the lagoon areas. Current procedures specify rubber gloves and safety glasses for all personnel handling waste materials.

#### 6. Production Impact Assessment

Mr. Morrison reported that current waste disposal procedures support production targets effectively. Line A operations generate approximately 340 gallons of solvent waste per day during peak production periods. The existing lagoon system capacity accommodates this volume without requiring operational modifications.

Mr. Brennan noted similar efficiency on Line B, with waste generation averaging 285 gallons daily. Both supervisors confirmed that disposal procedures do not create bottlenecks in the production process.

### DECISIONS MADE

1. **Continue Current Lagoon System Operations:** The committee unanimously agreed to maintain existing waste disposal procedures using the on-site lagoon system, given cost effectiveness and regulatory compliance.

2. **Defer Off-site Disposal Investigation:** Proposal to investigate commercial waste disposal services was tabled pending further cost analysis and regulatory developments.

3. **Enhance Monitoring Procedures:** Mr. Phelps will implement monthly water table measurements at monitoring wells MW-1 and MW-2, beginning October 1966.

4. **Update Safety Protocols:** Mr. Sullivan will revise safety procedures manual to include new federal guidelines expected in early 1967.

### ACTION ITEMS

| **Action Item** | **Responsible Party** | **Due Date** |
|---|---|---|
| Conduct sediment analysis of Pond 2 | Richard Phelps | October 15, 1966 |
| Review insurance coverage for environmental liability | Robert Hartwell | November 1, 1966 |
| Update employee training materials | James Sullivan | October 30, 1966 |
| Prepare quarterly disposal cost report | Dorothy Kemp | October 10, 1966 |
| Schedule maintenance on overflow systems | William Tessier | October 5, 1966 |

### NEXT MEETING

The next Waste Disposal Procedures Review Committee meeting is scheduled for **December 15, 1966, at 3:30 PM** in Conference Room B. Mr. McKenna will present updates on federal environmental regulations at that time.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

Mr. Hartwell reminded all attendees that waste disposal procedures are considered proprietary operational information and should not be discussed with external parties without prior authorization from management.

The committee acknowledged receipt of correspondence from the City of Woburn regarding municipal water supply expansion in the eastern section of the city. This development does not impact current operations or disposal procedures.
