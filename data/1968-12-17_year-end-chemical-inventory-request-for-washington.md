# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Chemical Supply Coordinator  
**FROM:** Grace Plant Chemist  
**DATE:** December 17, 1968  
**RE:** Year-End Chemical Inventory Request for Washington Street Facility

As we approach the end of fiscal year 1968, I am requesting immediate completion of our annual chemical inventory for the Washington Street facility. This inventory is required for both regulatory compliance and operational planning for the upcoming year. Please coordinate with all department supervisors to ensure accurate reporting of all chemical materials currently stored on-site.

The inventory must include all solvents, acids, bases, and specialty chemicals used in our manufacturing processes. Pay particular attention to our trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) stocks, as these represent our highest-volume cleaning solvents. We currently maintain approximately 2,400 gallons of TCE in the main storage area and an additional 800 gallons of PCE in the auxiliary tanks. These figures need verification against our purchase records from Ashland Chemical and Dow Chemical suppliers. Additionally, document all tetrachloroethylene reserves used in our degreasing operations, which should total approximately 1,200 gallons based on October procurement.

Our waste disposal protocols require documentation of all spent solvents and contaminated materials generated during the year. The disposal area behind Building C has been our primary location for temporary storage of waste materials pending pickup by our contracted disposal service. However, I have noted some concerns regarding the integrity of the storage containers in this area, particularly the 55-gallon drums containing spent degreasing solvents. Several containers show signs of corrosion and may require immediate attention to prevent spillage. The ground surface in this area appears discolored, which may indicate seepage from compromised containers.

Please complete this inventory by December 30, 1968, and forward all documentation to my office for review before submission to corporate headquarters. Include purchase receipts, usage logs, and disposal records for the complete calendar year. This information is essential for our annual environmental compliance reporting and will be reviewed by our corporate environmental affairs department in early January.
