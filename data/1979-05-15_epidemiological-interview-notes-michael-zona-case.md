- Family of four consuming approximately 300 gallons per day municipal water  
- Michael's specific consumption estimated at 6-8 glasses daily  
- Regular participation in municipal swimming programs using same water source  
- No occupational or secondary exposure sources identified  

**Temporal Correlation:**

- No radiation exposure history  
- Standard childhood immunization schedule followed  
- No known exposure to benzene or other industrial solvents outside water supply  

## FAMILY IMPACT AND OBSERVATIONS

**Mrs. Catherine Zona's Statement:**  
"Michael was a healthy, active boy until the summer before he got sick. He played Little League baseball and rode his bike all over the neighborhood. When he started getting tired all the time, we thought maybe he was just growing. But then the bruises started appearing, and they wouldn't heal properly. The doctors at Mass General did everything they could, but he suffered so much during those months of treatment. He was brave, but he was scared. He knew what was happening to him."

**Mr. Anthony Zona's Statement:**  
"We never questioned the water. It was city water - we thought it was safe. If we had known there were chemicals in it, we would have done something different. Michael drank that water every day of his life. Now we find out after he's gone that the wells were contaminated. It doesn't bring him back, but people need to know what happened here."

## INVESTIGATOR OBSERVATIONS

The Zona family presents as credible historians with detailed recall of Michael's illness progression. Medical records from Massachusetts General Hospital corroborate the timeline and symptom progression described by the parents. The family's exclusive reliance on municipal water from Wells G and H throughout Michael's lifetime establishes clear potential exposure pathway.

The temporal relationship between Michael's leukemia diagnosis and the subsequent discovery of volatile organic compound contamination in Wells G and H warrants inclusion in the broader epidemiological investigation of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Medical Record Review:** Complete analysis of all medical records from Massachusetts General Hospital and Woburn Family Practice
2. **Exposure Assessment:** Detailed modeling of potential TCE exposure levels based on Wells G and H contamination data
3. **Case Classification:** Include Michael Zona case in cluster analysis with other East Woburn childhood leukemia cases
4. **Follow-up:** Monitor remaining family members for potential health effects

## DOCUMENTATION COMPLETED

**Attachments:**  
- Copy of death certificate  
- Medical record summary from Dr. Robert Harrison  
- Residential history verification  
- Water service connection records  

**Next Steps:**  
- Submit case summary to CDC for inclusion in national leukemia registry  
- Coordinate with ongoing EPA investigation of Wells G and H contamination  
- Maintain case file for potential legal proceedings
