# ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS OF CHEMICAL SUPPLY COSTS

**John J. Riley Company**  
228 Salem Street  
East Woburn, Massachusetts

**TO:** John J. Riley, President  
**FROM:** Accounting Department  
**DATE:** June 26, 1957  
**RE:** Fiscal Year 1956-1957 Chemical Supply Cost Analysis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of chemical procurement and related operational costs for the John J. Riley Company tannery operations for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1957. Total chemical supply expenditures for the reporting period reached $47,832.15, representing a 12.3% increase over the previous fiscal year. This increase reflects both expanded production capacity and rising costs for essential tanning chemicals, particularly chromium sulfate and sodium sulfide compounds.

The accounting department has identified several cost optimization opportunities while maintaining compliance with current operational standards. Key findings indicate that our chemical waste disposal arrangements continue to provide significant cost savings compared to alternative disposal methods employed by competing facilities in the region.

## CHEMICAL PROCUREMENT ANALYSIS

### Primary Tanning Chemicals

**Chromium Sulfate (Chrome Tanning Agent)**
- Total purchased: 47,200 pounds
- Average cost per pound: $0.18
- Total expenditure: $8,496.00

## OPERATIONAL COST ANALYSIS

### Waste Disposal Operations

The company's current waste disposal arrangements continue to demonstrate exceptional cost efficiency. Our established practice of utilizing the rear property areas adjacent to the Aberjona River for waste settling and natural filtration has eliminated the need for expensive third-party waste removal services that burden many competing facilities.

**Cost Comparison Analysis:**
- Riley Company disposal costs: $1,247.00 annually
- Industry average disposal costs: $8,500-$12,000 annually
- **Annual savings: $7,253-$10,753**

This disposal method involves the controlled release of processed chemical waste into specially constructed settling areas on our property, allowing natural soil filtration to process the waste materials before they reach groundwater levels. The system has operated without incident since its implementation in 1923 and continues to meet all applicable regulatory requirements.

### Labor and Equipment Costs

Chemical handling and mixing operations required 2,847 man-hours during the reporting period, at an average wage of $1.42 per hour, totaling $4,042.74 in direct labor costs. Equipment maintenance for chemical storage tanks, mixing vessels, and transfer systems totaled $1,892.33.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health conducted its routine inspection of our facilities on March 15, 1957, finding all chemical storage and handling procedures in compliance with current state regulations. No citations or corrective actions were required.

Recent industry discussions suggest that federal oversight of industrial chemical usage may increase in coming years. However, our current operations and disposal methods align with all existing regulatory frameworks. The accounting department recommends maintaining current supplier relationships and disposal practices to preserve our competitive cost advantages.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Supplier Diversification**: Consider establishing relationships with additional chromium sulfate suppliers to mitigate potential supply disruptions.

2. **Bulk Purchase Agreements**: Negotiate annual contracts for primary chemicals to lock in current pricing and avoid projected 1958 price increases.

3. **Inventory Management**: Optimize chemical storage capacity to take advantage of bulk pricing while maintaining safe storage practices.

4. **Cost Monitoring**: Implement quarterly chemical cost reviews to identify pricing trends and adjustment opportunities.

5. **Disposal Efficiency**: Continue current waste disposal practices while monitoring any changes in regulatory requirements that might necessitate future modifications.

## FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS

Based on planned production increases for fiscal year 1957-1958, we project chemical supply costs will reach approximately $52,500, assuming current pricing structures remain stable. This represents a sustainable increase proportional to expanded production capacity.

The continued efficiency of our waste disposal operations will remain crucial to maintaining competitive operating costs. Alternative disposal methods would add $7,000-$10,000 annually to operational expenses, significantly impacting profit margins.
