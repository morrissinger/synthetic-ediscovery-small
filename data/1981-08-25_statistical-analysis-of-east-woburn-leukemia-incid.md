# Statistical Analysis of East Woburn Leukemia Incidence Rates

**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**

**TO:** Director of Environmental Health, CDC  
**FROM:** Dr. Richard Clapp, Senior Epidemiologist  
**DATE:** August 25, 1981  
**SUBJECT:** Statistical Analysis of Childhood Leukemia Cluster in East Woburn, Massachusetts

## Abstract

This technical analysis examines the statistical significance of childhood leukemia incidence rates in East Woburn, Massachusetts, with particular focus on the area served by municipal Wells G and H. The analysis covers the period from 1964 to 1981 and compares observed cases against expected rates based on national and regional baseline data. Results indicate a statistically significant cluster of acute lymphocytic leukemia cases among children under fifteen years of age, with an observed-to-expected ratio of 7.5:1 in the immediate vicinity of the contaminated water supply.

## Introduction

On March 23, 1981, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health requested CDC assistance in evaluating reports of elevated childhood leukemia rates in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Initial reports suggested a potential cluster of cases in children who had consumed water from municipal Wells G and H, which were closed in May 1979 following detection of organic chemical contamination. This analysis was conducted to determine whether the observed cases represent a statistically significant deviation from expected incidence rates and to assess potential exposure-disease relationships.

## Methodology

### Study Population

The study area was defined as the East Woburn section served by Wells G and H, encompassing approximately 5,000 residents. The wells operated from May 1964 (Well G) and October 1966 (Well H) until closure in May 1979. Census data from 1970 and 1980 were used to estimate the population at risk, with particular attention to children under fifteen years of age.

### Case Definition

Cases were defined as residents of the study area diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) between January 1964 and December 1980, with age at diagnosis under fifteen years. Medical records were reviewed through Massachusetts Cancer Registry data, hospital records from Massachusetts General Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, and other treating facilities.

### Statistical Analysis

Expected case numbers were calculated using age-specific incidence rates from the Third National Cancer Survey (1969-1971) and Connecticut Tumor Registry data (1968-1972). The Poisson distribution was used to calculate confidence intervals and test statistical significance. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for various demographic and geographic subgroups.

## Results

### Case Identification

**Confirmed Cases (1964-1980):**

1. **James Anderson** - DOB: July 16, 1968; Diagnosis: January 1972 (age 3); Address: 11 Orange Street; Status: Deceased January 18, 1981
2. **Kevin Kane Jr.** - DOB: March 12, 1963; Diagnosis: August 1970 (age 7); Address: 14 Salem Street; Status: Deceased
3. **Michael Zona** - DOB: September 8, 1965; Diagnosis: June 1973 (age 7); Address: 58 Pine Street; Status: Deceased
4. **Patrick Toomey** - DOB: February 22, 1967; Diagnosis: April 1974 (age 7); Address: 266 Salem Street; Status: Deceased
5. **Carl Robbins III** - DOB: May 15, 1969; Diagnosis: November 1975 (age 6); Address: 12 Maple Street; Status: Deceased
6. **Roland Gamache** - DOB: October 3, 1964; Diagnosis: March 1976 (age 11); Address: 135 Washington Street; Status: Deceased

### Statistical Findings

**Population at Risk:**
- Total East Woburn population (Wells G&H service area): ~5,000
- Children under 15 years (average 1964-1980): ~1,200
- Person-years at risk (children <15): 20,400

**Expected vs. Observed Cases:**
- Expected cases (based on national rates): 0.8 cases
- Observed cases: 6 cases
- **Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR): 7.5** (95% CI: 2.8-16.3)
- **P-value: <0.001** (highly statistically significant)

**Temporal Distribution:**
- 1970-1972: 2 cases (25% of total)
- 1973-1976: 4 cases (67% of total)
- Peak incidence: 1973-1975 (3 cases in 3 years)

**Geographic Clustering:**
All cases resided within 0.5 miles of Wells G and H. The highest concentration occurred along Salem Street and adjacent residential areas, with 4 of 6 cases (67%) living within 1,000 feet of the well sites.

### Age and Gender Distribution

- **Mean age at diagnosis:** 6.8 years (range: 3-11 years)
- **Gender distribution:** 5 males, 1 female (5:1 ratio)
- **National comparison:** Expected ratio 1.2:1 (male:female)

### Survival Analysis

**Mortality Data:**
- Deaths: 6 of 6 cases (100% case fatality rate)
- Mean survival time: 8.2 years from diagnosis
- Range: 4.5-12.8 years survival

The case fatality rate significantly exceeds national averages for childhood ALL during this period (approximately 60-70% five-year survival rate with treatment).

## Environmental Correlation

### Water Quality Data

Analysis of available water quality data from Wells G and H reveals:

**Trichloroethylene (TCE):**
- Maximum detected: 400 parts per billion (ppb)
- Average concentration (1978-1979): 267 ppb
- EPA action level (1981): 2.7 ppb

**Tetrachloroethylene (PCE):**
- Maximum detected: 43 ppb
- Average concentration (1978-1979): 21 ppb
- No federal standard established (1981)

**Exposure Assessment:**
Based on residential history data, all six cases had prenatal and/or early childhood exposure to contaminated water from Wells G and H. The mean duration of exposure was 9.2 years per case.

## Discussion

### Statistical Significance

The observed standardized incidence ratio of 7.5 represents an extraordinarily elevated risk that cannot reasonably be attributed to chance (p<0.001). The tight geographic clustering around the contaminated wells, combined with the temporal relationship between well operation and case occurrence, suggests a strong association between water contamination and leukemia incidence.

### Biological Plausibility

Trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are classified as probable human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Animal studies have demonstrated leukemogenic potential, particularly for TCE exposure during early development. The latency period observed (mean 4.2 years from first exposure to diagnosis) is consistent with known carcinogenic mechanisms for hematopoietic malignancies.

### Limitations

1. **Small sample size:** While statistically significant, the absolute number of cases limits subgroup analysis
2. **Exposure assessment:** Precise individual exposure levels cannot be determined due to lack of historical monitoring data
3. **Confounding factors:** Genetic predisposition and other environmental exposures have not been fully evaluated
4. **Reporting bias:** Increased awareness may have influenced case ascertainment

## Conclusions

The statistical analysis provides compelling evidence of a childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn associated with consumption of water from contaminated municipal Wells G and H. Key findings include:

1. **Highly significant excess incidence:** SIR = 7.5 (p<0.001)
2. **Geographic clustering:** All cases within 0.5 miles of contaminated wells
3. **Temporal relationship:** Peak incidence during period of maximum well usage
4. **Exposure correlation:** All cases
