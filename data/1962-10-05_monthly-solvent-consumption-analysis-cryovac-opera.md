# W.R. GRACE COMPANY
## CRYOVAC DIVISION
### WOBURN MANUFACTURING FACILITY

**TO:** W.R. Grace Facility Manager  
**FROM:** Production Department  
**DATE:** October 5, 1962  
**RE:** Monthly Solvent Consumption Analysis - Cryovac Operations

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents the monthly analysis of solvent consumption for our Cryovac packaging film operations at the Woburn facility for the period ending September 30, 1962. Total solvent usage reached 47,200 gallons across all production lines, representing a 12% increase over the previous month due to expanded third-shift operations and new contract fulfillment requirements.

## Solvent Usage by Category

### Primary Production Solvents

**Trichloroethylene (TCE)**
- Monthly consumption: 18,750 gallons
- Primary use: Degreasing operations and equipment cleaning

- Supplier: Dow Chemical Company

**Perchloroethylene (PCE)**
- Monthly consumption: 14,200 gallons
- Primary use: Film cleaning and vapor degreasing
- Storage location: Tank Farm Area C, Tanks 12-14
- Unit cost: $0.52 per gallon
- Supplier: DuPont Chemical

**1,1,1-Trichloroethane**
- Monthly consumption: 8,900 gallons
- Primary use: Parts cleaning and maintenance operations
- Storage location: Tank Farm Area A, Tanks 3-5
- Unit cost: $0.41 per gallon
- Supplier: Union Carbide Corporation

### Secondary Cleaning Solvents

**Carbon Tetrachloride**
- Monthly consumption: 3,150 gallons
- Primary use: Specialized cleaning operations
- Storage location: Building 12, Secondary Storage
- Unit cost: $0.38 per gallon

**Methylene Chloride**
- Monthly consumption: 2,200 gallons
- Primary use: Print roller cleaning
- Storage location: Print Shop Storage Area

## Production Line Analysis

### Line A (24-hour operation)
- Solvent consumption: 19,400 gallons
- Primary products: Food packaging films
- Efficiency rating: 94.2%
- Waste solvent generated: 1,850 gallons

### Line B (16-hour operation)
- Solvent consumption: 15,600 gallons
- Primary products: Industrial packaging materials
- Efficiency rating: 91.7%
- Waste solvent generated: 1,420 gallons

### Line C (12-hour operation)
- Solvent consumption: 12,200 gallons
- Primary products: Specialty films
- Efficiency rating: 89.3%
- Waste solvent generated: 1,180 gallons

## Waste Disposal Operations

### Current Disposal Methods

The facility continues to operate under established disposal protocols for spent solvents and cleaning solutions. Waste solvents are collected in designated containers and transported to the rear disposal area adjacent to the Aberjona River marshland.

**Primary Disposal Areas:**
- Area 1: Located 200 feet southwest of main production building
- Area 2: Located 350 feet west of Tank Farm Area B
- Area 3: Located adjacent to railroad right-of-way

**Monthly Disposal Volumes:**
- Spent TCE: 1,650 gallons
- Spent PCE: 1,280 gallons
- Mixed solvent waste: 2,120 gallons
- Contaminated cleaning materials: 850 gallons

### Disposal Methodology

Waste solvents are transported via company trucks to designated disposal areas where they are discharged into excavated pits lined with gravel for drainage purposes. This method ensures efficient disposal while maintaining cost-effectiveness for operations. The natural soil filtration system processes the waste materials, and the proximity to existing marsh areas provides additional natural treatment capacity.

## Cost Analysis

### Total Monthly Solvent Costs
- Purchase costs: $21,847
- Transportation costs: $1,240
- Storage and handling: $890
- Disposal operations: $420
- **Total monthly cost: $24,397**

### Cost Per Unit Production
- Average cost per thousand square feet of film: $3.42
- Solvent cost as percentage of total production cost: 18.7%

## Operational Recommendations

### Efficiency Improvements

1. **Equipment Maintenance**: Implement weekly cleaning schedules for vapor degreasing equipment to reduce solvent consumption by an estimated 8-10%.

2. **Solvent Recovery**: Consider installation of distillation equipment for TCE recovery operations, with projected savings of $3,200 monthly.

3. **Inventory Management**: Optimize storage tank rotations to minimize solvent degradation and waste generation.

### Facility Modifications

The production department recommends expanding the current disposal area capacity to accommodate projected increases in solvent usage for the fourth quarter. Additional excavation work in Area 2 would provide sufficient capacity for the anticipated 15% increase in waste solvent generation.

## Safety and Compliance Notes

All solvent handling operations continue to meet current industry standards for worker safety and environmental management. Monthly safety inspections have identified no significant concerns with current storage or disposal practices. The facility maintains compliance with all applicable Massachusetts industrial regulations regarding chemical storage and handling.

**Ventilation Systems:**
- All production areas maintain adequate air circulation
- Vapor recovery systems operating at 92% efficiency
- Monthly air quality measurements within acceptable ranges

**Storage Tank Inspections:**
- All primary storage tanks inspected monthly
- No significant leakage detected
- Tank integrity ratings satisfactory across all storage areas

## Fourth Quarter Projections

Based on current production schedules and new contract requirements, the following solvent consumption increases are anticipated:

- TCE consumption: Increase to 21,500 gallons monthly
- PCE consumption: Increase to 16,800 gallons monthly
- Overall disposal requirements: Increase to 5,200 gallons monthly

These projections account for the planned expansion of Line B operations and the addition of weekend production shifts to meet holiday season packaging demands.

## Conclusion

Current solvent operations continue to support efficient production while maintaining cost-effectiveness. The established disposal protocols provide reliable waste management capability, and the facility's strategic location adjacent to natural drainage areas ensures environmentally sound disposal practices. Recommended efficiency improvements could reduce monthly costs by approximately $4,100 while maintaining production quality standards.
