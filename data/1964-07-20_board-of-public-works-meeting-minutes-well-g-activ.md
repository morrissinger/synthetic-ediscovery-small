## AGENDA ITEM 2: WELL G ACTIVATION AND OPERATIONAL STATUS

Chairman Mitchell called for Water Superintendent Davidson's report on the status of Well G operations.

**Superintendent Davidson reported:**
- Well G drilling completed June 15, 1964, to depth of 88 feet
- Pump installation and electrical connections completed July 10, 1964
- Initial water quality testing conducted by Massachusetts Department of Public Health on July 12-14, 1964
- Bacteriological tests show acceptable levels within state standards
- Chemical analysis indicates mineral content within normal parameters for the region
- Flow rate tested at 400 gallons per minute sustained capacity
- Well positioned to serve eastern residential areas, particularly neighborhoods east of Main Street (Route 38)

**Discussion Points:**

Commissioner Kelley inquired about the integration of Well G into the existing distribution system. Superintendent Davidson explained that the well will function as a supplemental source during peak demand periods, particularly during summer months when residential usage increases. The well connects to the main distribution line serving Pine Street, Olympia Avenue, and surrounding residential streets in East Woburn.

Commissioner Murphy raised questions regarding ongoing monitoring protocols. Dr. Lawson stated that routine bacteriological testing will be conducted monthly in accordance with state health department requirements, with additional chemical analysis performed quarterly. He noted that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has established clear guidelines for municipal water supply monitoring, and the city will maintain compliance with all regulatory standards.

Commissioner O'Brien asked about capacity projections for the growing community. Superintendent Davidson indicated that with Woburn's current population of approximately 35,000 residents, Well G provides crucial additional capacity to meet increasing residential and light industrial demand. The well's location in the Aberjona River watershed provides access to a substantial aquifer that should serve the community's needs for the foreseeable future.

**Chairman Mitchell's Comments:**
The Chairman emphasized the importance of this expansion to the municipal water system, noting that reliable water supply is essential for continued residential development and economic growth in Woburn. He commended the Public Works Department for completing the project on schedule and within the approved budget of $47,500.

## AGENDA ITEM 3: WELL G ACTIVATION AUTHORIZATION

**Motion:** Commissioner Murphy moved that the Board of Public Works hereby authorizes the immediate activation of Well G for municipal water supply service to residents of East Woburn, contingent upon final approval from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and compliance with all applicable state and local health regulations.

**Discussion:**
Dr. Lawson confirmed that all preliminary testing results meet or exceed state standards for municipal water supply. He recommended that activation proceed as planned, with the understanding that routine monitoring will commence immediately upon operational status.

Superintendent Davidson noted that activation will occur in phases, beginning with integration testing during off-peak hours to ensure proper system pressure and flow distribution. Full operational status is anticipated by July 25, 1964.

**Seconded:** Commissioner Kelley  
**Vote:** Unanimous approval (4-0)

## AGENDA ITEM 4: PUBLIC NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES

**Discussion:**
Commissioner O'Brien suggested that residents in the affected service area should be notified of the new water source. Chairman Mitchell agreed that transparency in municipal operations builds public confidence.

**Motion:** Commissioner O'Brien moved that the City Clerk be directed to publish notice in the Woburn Daily Times regarding the activation of Well G, including information about the testing procedures and safety standards met.

**Seconded:** Commissioner Sullivan  
**Vote:** Unanimous approval (4-0)

## AGENDA ITEM 5: ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND MONITORING SCHEDULE

Superintendent Davidson presented a comprehensive maintenance schedule for Well G operations:

**Monthly Requirements:**
- Bacteriological testing by certified laboratory
- Pump performance and electrical system inspection
- Flow rate verification and pressure monitoring
- Physical inspection of wellhead and surrounding area

**Quarterly Requirements:**
- Chemical analysis including mineral content, pH levels, and standard contaminant screening
- Comprehensive pump maintenance and calibration
- Distribution system pressure testing in served areas

**Annual Requirements:**
- Complete water quality analysis by Massachusetts Department of Public Health
- Pump and electrical system overhaul as needed
- Wellhead security and structural integrity assessment

The Board accepted the proposed maintenance schedule without modification.

## AGENDA ITEM 6: BUDGET IMPLICATIONS AND ONGOING COSTS

Commissioner Murphy inquired about operational costs for Well G. Superintendent Davidson provided the following estimates:

- Monthly electrical costs: $85-120 depending on usage
- Quarterly testing and analysis: $45
- Annual maintenance and repairs: $300-500
- Total estimated annual operating cost: $1,500-2,000

Chairman Mitchell noted that these costs were anticipated in the current fiscal year budget and should not require additional appropriations.

## AGENDA ITEM 7: FUTURE SYSTEM EXPANSION CONSIDERATIONS

**Discussion:**
Commissioner Kelley raised the possibility of additional wells to serve the growing community. Superintendent Davidson indicated that preliminary geological surveys suggest additional drilling sites may be viable in the eastern watershed area, though specific locations would require detailed hydrological analysis.

Chairman Mitchell directed that this matter be placed on the agenda for the August 17, 1964 meeting, allowing time for preliminary cost estimates and feasibility studies.
