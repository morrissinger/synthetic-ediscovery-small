### CHIEF COMPLAINT

Patient brought in by mother with complaints of persistent fatigue, recurring nosebleeds, and unusual bruising over the past six weeks. Mother reports child has been "not himself" and appears pale and listless compared to normal activity levels.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Toomey reports that Patrick has experienced increasing fatigue since early July 1979. Initially attributed to summer heat and increased outdoor activity, but symptoms have progressively worsened. Patient complains of feeling "tired all the time" and has been reluctant to engage in usual childhood activities including bicycle riding and baseball with neighborhood children.

Nosebleeds began approximately four weeks ago, occurring 2-3 times per week, typically lasting 10-15 minutes. Episodes occur spontaneously, not associated with trauma or nose picking. Mother notes bleeding seems more difficult to control than typical childhood nosebleeds.

Bruising noticed on legs and arms over past three weeks. Mother describes bruises as appearing "out of nowhere" and notes they are larger and darker than would be expected from normal childhood bumps and falls. Several bruises noted on shins, forearms, and one prominent bruise on left shoulder without recalled trauma.

Patient also reports occasional headaches, described as "dull ache" primarily frontal, occurring 2-3 times per week. No associated nausea or visual changes.

Appetite has decreased noticeably over past month. Mother reports Patrick eating approximately half his normal portions and showing little interest in previously favored foods.

### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

Birth history unremarkable. Full-term delivery, normal birth weight 7 lbs 2 oz. No significant illnesses during infancy or early childhood.
