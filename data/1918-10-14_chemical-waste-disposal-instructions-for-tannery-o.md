# WORK ORDER - CHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS

**John J. Riley Company**  
228 Salem Street  
East Woburn, Massachusetts

**TO:** All Tannery Floor Workers  
**FROM:** William Hayes, Floor Supervisor  
**DATE:** October 14, 1918  
**RE:** Revised Chemical Waste Disposal Procedures - Immediate Implementation Required

---

## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

All workers are hereby directed to follow these revised procedures for the disposal of chemical wastes generated during leather processing operations. These instructions supersede all previous verbal directions and are to be implemented immediately upon receipt of this work order.

## CHROMIUM SOLUTIONS AND CHROME TANNING LIQUORS

All spent chromium solutions from the chrome tanning vats are to be collected in the designated wooden barrels located at the east end of the tanning floor. When barrels reach three-quarters capacity, workers shall transport them via hand cart to the disposal area located approximately 200 yards east of the main building, near the railroad embankment. Contents are to be emptied directly into the excavated pit adjacent to the Aberjona River access point.

**Important:** Do not allow chromium solutions to pool on the tanning floor. Immediate disposal prevents damage to leather goods and maintains proper working conditions.

## SULFURIC ACID AND PICKLING SOLUTIONS

Acid solutions used in the pickling process shall be neutralized with lime before disposal. Mix one part lime to every four parts acid solution in the metal containers provided. Once neutralized, the resulting mixture may be disposed of in the same excavated pit used for chromium waste. Exercise caution when handling acid solutions - wear leather aprons and avoid contact with skin.

Workers experiencing burns or irritation from acid contact should report to the office immediately for treatment with bicarbonate solution.

## VEGETABLE TANNING EXTRACTS AND ORGANIC WASTE

Spent bark extracts, sumac solutions, and other organic tanning materials shall be collected separately from mineral tanning wastes. These materials may be disposed of in the secondary pit located 50 yards south of the main disposal area, closer to the river bank. This organic waste will decompose naturally and poses no concern for disposal in this manner.

## DEHAIRING AND LIMING SOLUTIONS

Solutions containing lime, sodium sulfide, and other dehairing chemicals are to be collected in the large metal drums positioned near the beam house entrance. When drums are full, contents shall be transported to the main disposal pit and emptied directly. The high alkalinity of these solutions helps neutralize any residual acids in the disposal area.

## CLEANING SOLVENTS AND FINISHING CHEMICALS

All solvents used for cleaning equipment and any finishing chemicals including dyes, oils, and waterproofing compounds shall be disposed of in the main excavated pit. Small quantities may be poured directly into the pit during regular disposal rounds. Larger quantities should be transported in buckets or containers as needed.

**Note:** The sandy soil conditions in the disposal area provide excellent drainage, ensuring that waste materials do not accumulate or create unsanitary conditions around the facility.

## DISPOSAL SCHEDULE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

- **Morning Shift (6:00 AM - 2:00 PM):** Thomas McCarthy and Peter Sullivan responsible for chromium and acid disposal
- **Afternoon Shift (2:00 PM - 10:00 PM):** James O'Brien and Michael Flanagan responsible for organic waste and solvent disposal
- **Evening Cleanup:** All workers participate in final disposal of daily accumulated wastes

Each shift supervisor shall ensure that disposal activities are completed before shift change. No chemical wastes are to remain on the production floor overnight due to fire hazard and potential damage to leather inventory.

## SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

Workers engaged in waste disposal activities must wear protective leather aprons and gloves when available. Avoid prolonged contact with chemical solutions. In case of spillage on clothing or skin, rinse immediately with clean water from the well pump located near the office building.

Report any unusual odors, skin irritation, or equipment damage to supervision immediately. The company maintains a supply of bicarbonate solution and clean rags in the office for treatment of minor chemical burns.

## EFFICIENCY AND COST CONSIDERATIONS

These disposal procedures are designed to maintain efficient production flow while minimizing costs associated with waste handling. The natural drainage provided by the sandy soil conditions eliminates the need for expensive waste hauling services utilized by some competing tanneries in the region.

The proximity of disposal areas to production facilities reduces time spent on waste handling activities, allowing workers to focus on productive leather processing tasks. The excavated pits provide sufficient capacity for current production levels and anticipated expansion of operations.

## COMPLIANCE WITH COMPANY POLICY

All workers are expected to follow these procedures exactly as written. Any deviation from established disposal methods must be approved by floor supervision. The company's commitment to efficient operations and cost control depends upon consistent adherence to these waste management practices.

Workers who fail to follow proper disposal procedures may face disciplinary action including reduction in hours or termination of employment. The success of Riley Company operations depends upon each worker fulfilling his responsibilities in all aspects of production, including proper waste disposal.

These instructions remain in effect until further notice. Questions regarding specific disposal procedures should be directed to shift supervisors or to the undersigned.
