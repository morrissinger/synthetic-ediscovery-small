# ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
## GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION ASSESSMENT REPORT

**Site:** W.R. Grace & Company Manufacturing Facility  
**Location:** 300 Washington Street, Woburn, Massachusetts  
**EPA Region:** I  
**Report Date:** January 8, 1982  
**Field Investigation Period:** November 15, 1981 - December 30, 1981  
**Principal Investigator:** Dr. Robert H. Matthews, Environmental Engineer  
**Report Number:** EPA-R1-GW-82-001

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Environmental Protection Agency conducted a comprehensive groundwater contamination assessment at the W.R. Grace & Company manufacturing facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, following reports of elevated volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations in municipal water supply Wells G and H. This investigation was initiated in response to community health concerns and preliminary findings of chemical contamination in the local groundwater system.

The assessment reveals significant groundwater contamination extending from the W.R. Grace facility property toward the municipal wellfield. Primary contaminants identified include trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and related chlorinated solvents at concentrations substantially exceeding safe drinking water standards. The contamination plume extends approximately 1,200 feet downgradient from the facility and directly impacts the capture zone of municipal Wells G and H.

Based on hydrogeological analysis and contaminant distribution patterns, the W.R. Grace facility represents a significant source of groundwater contamination that has compromised the integrity of Woburn's municipal water supply system.

## SITE DESCRIPTION

### Facility Operations
The W.R. Grace & Company facility at 300 Washington Street has operated as a chemical manufacturing plant since 1954, producing specialty chemicals including food packaging materials and industrial solvents. The 15-acre property contains multiple manufacturing buildings, storage areas, and waste management facilities. Primary operations have included:

- Chemical synthesis and processing operations
- Solvent recovery and recycling activities  
- Raw material storage and handling
- Waste solvent storage in above-ground tanks
- Historical disposal activities in on-site lagoons

### Hydrogeological Setting
The facility is situated within the Aberjona River valley, characterized by unconsolidated glacial deposits overlying bedrock. The local hydrogeology consists of:

**Surficial Materials:**
- 0-8 feet: Fill material and organic soils
- 8-25 feet: Fine to medium sand with silt layers
- 25-40 feet: Coarse sand and gravel (primary aquifer)
- 40+ feet: Glacial till and bedrock

**Groundwater Flow:**
Groundwater flow direction is generally southeast toward the Aberjona River and municipal wellfield. The hydraulic gradient averages 0.008 feet/foot, with groundwater velocities estimated at 0.5-1.2 feet per day. The municipal Wells G and H are located approximately 1,200 feet downgradient from the facility.

## INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY

### Monitoring Well Installation
A total of 12 monitoring wells were installed using hollow-stem auger drilling methods. Wells were constructed with 2-inch diameter PVC casing and 10-foot screened intervals positioned within the primary aquifer zone. Well locations were surveyed to establish precise elevations and coordinates.

**Well Network:**
- MW-1 through MW-4: On-site facility monitoring
- MW-5 through MW-8: Property boundary locations  
- MW-9 through MW-12: Downgradient plume delineation

### Sampling and Analysis Protocol
Groundwater samples were collected using dedicated bailers following EPA-approved low-flow sampling procedures. All samples were preserved with hydrochloric acid and maintained at 4°C during transport to the EPA Region I laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts.

**Analytical Methods:**
- Volatile Organic Compounds: EPA Method 601 (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry)
- Detection Limits: 1.0 μg/L for individual compounds
- Quality Control: 10% duplicate samples, method blanks, and spike recoveries

### Water Level Monitoring
Static water levels were measured monthly using electronic water level indicators calibrated to 0.01 feet. Measurements were used to construct potentiometric surface maps and determine groundwater flow directions.

## INVESTIGATION RESULTS

### Contaminant Distribution
Groundwater contamination was detected in 9 of 12 monitoring wells, with the highest concentrations observed in on-site wells MW-1 and MW-2. The contamination plume extends southeast from the facility toward the municipal wellfield.

**Trichloroethylene (TCE) Concentrations:**
- MW-1 (on-site): 2,400 μg/L
- MW-2 (on-site): 1,850 μg/L  
- MW-6 (boundary): 890 μg/L
- MW-9 (downgradient): 340 μg/L
- MW-11 (near wells): 180 μg/L

**Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) Concentrations:**
- MW-1 (on-site): 650 μg/L
- MW-2 (on-site): 420 μg/L
- MW-6 (boundary): 210 μg/L
- MW-9 (downgradient): 85 μg/L
- MW-11 (near wells): 35 μg/L

### Municipal Well Impact Assessment
Historical sampling data from Wells G and H indicates chronic contamination since well installation:

**Well G (installed 1964):**
- TCE: 267-400 μg/L (1979-1981 sampling)
- PCE: 28-43 μg/L (1979-1981 sampling)

**Well H (installed 1966):**
- TCE: 183-320 μg/L (1979-1981 sampling)  
- PCE: 21-38 μg/L (1979-1981 sampling)

These concentrations significantly exceed EPA proposed maximum contaminant levels of 5 μg/L for TCE and 10 μg/L for PCE.

### Source Area Investigation
Soil and groundwater investigations within the W.R. Grace facility identified multiple potential source areas:

**Area A - Former Waste Lagoons:**
Historical aerial photographs indicate three unlined lagoons operated from 1954-1968. Soil samples contained TCE up to 15,000 mg/kg and PCE up to 8,200 mg/kg.

**Area B - Solvent Storage Area:**
Active and former above-ground storage tanks containing waste solvents. Soil contamination extends to 12 feet below ground surface with TCE concentrations up to 4,500 mg/kg.

**Area C - Process Building Sumps:**
Floor drains and sump systems within manufacturing buildings show evidence of historical solvent disposal. Groundwater beneath buildings contains TCE up to 3,200 μg/L.

## HYDROGEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

### Contaminant Transport Modeling
Groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling indicates that contamination from the W.R. Grace facility reaches the municipal wellfield within 18-24 months under current hydrogeological conditions. The modeling utilized the following parameters:

- Hydraulic conductivity: 85 feet/day (aquifer testing results)
- Effective porosity: 0.25 (laboratory analysis)
- Longitudinal dispersivity: 50 feet
- Retardation factors: TCE = 1.8, PCE = 2.1

### Wellhead Protection Analysis
The capture zone analysis for Wells G and H demonstrates that approximately 40% of the water pumped from these wells originates from the contaminated groundwater plume. Under maximum pumping conditions (1.5 million gallons per day combined), the wells capture contaminated groundwater from the W.R. Grace facility within their zone of influence.

## FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

### Primary Findings

1. **Significant Groundwater Contamination:** The W.R. Grace facility has released substantial quantities of chlorinated solvents to the underlying groundwater system, creating a contamination plume extending over 1,200 feet downgradient.

2. **Municipal
