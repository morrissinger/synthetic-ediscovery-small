# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** All Field Technicians  
**FROM:** Robert J. McCarthy, Water Department Supervisor  
**DATE:** December 11, 1967  
**RE:** Water Quality Testing Schedule and Sample Collection Protocol

Effective immediately, all field technicians are required to follow the updated water quality testing schedule and sample collection procedures outlined below. These protocols are necessary to ensure compliance with state health department requirements and to maintain the integrity of our municipal water supply system.

## Weekly Testing Schedule

Beginning Monday, December 18, 1967, water samples shall be collected from the following locations according to the schedule below:

**Wells G and H (East Woburn Supply):**
- Sample collection: Mondays and Thursdays at 0800 hours
- Location: Direct from wellhead before treatment
- Tests required: Bacteriological analysis, pH, turbidity, chlorine residual
- Chain of custody forms must accompany all samples to Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory in Jamaica Plain

**Primary Distribution System:**
- Sample collection: Tuesdays and Fridays at 0900 hours
- Locations: Fire Station #3 (Pleasant Street), East Woburn Elementary School (Montvale Avenue), Municipal Building (Pleasant Street)
- Tests required: Bacteriological analysis, chlorine residual

**Residential Monitoring Points:**
- Sample collection: Wednesdays at various times
- Locations: Rotating schedule of homes in East Woburn area, particularly those served by Wells G and H
- Homeowner notification required 24 hours in advance
- Tests required: Bacteriological analysis, taste and odor evaluation

## Sample Collection Procedures

All water samples must be collected using sterile glass containers provided by the laboratory. Containers are available in the supply room and must be logged out on Form WD-23. Before collecting samples, allow water to run for a minimum of three minutes to ensure representative sampling. For bacteriological samples, flame sterilize the tap opening with a lighter for ten seconds before collection. Fill containers to the neck, leaving minimal air space, and cap immediately.

Each sample container must be labeled with the following information: location, date, time of collection, technician initials, and sample type. Attach the appropriate chain of custody documentation and transport samples to the laboratory within four hours of collection. Samples requiring refrigeration must be kept in the ice chest during transport.

## Documentation Requirements

Maintain detailed records of all sampling activities in the official water quality log book. Record any unusual observations including taste, odor, color, or clarity issues. Note any complaints received from residents regarding water quality and cross-reference with sampling locations and dates. Submit weekly summary reports to my office every Friday by 1600 hours.

Any abnormal test results or citizen complaints regarding water quality must be reported to me immediately. Do not discuss test results or water quality issues with residents or members of the public. Direct all inquiries to the main office at MAyfair 4-7200.

Questions regarding these procedures should be directed to me or to Assistant Supervisor William Connors. Failure to follow these protocols may result in disciplinary action.
