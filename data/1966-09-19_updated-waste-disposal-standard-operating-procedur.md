**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** All Washington Street Facility Staff  
**FROM:** Thomas R. Mitchell, Operations Manager  
**DATE:** September 19, 1966  
**RE:** Updated Waste Disposal Standard Operating Procedures - Effective October 1, 1966

---

## Purpose and Scope

This memorandum establishes updated standard operating procedures for the disposal of manufacturing waste materials at the Cryovac Washington Street facility. These procedures supersede all previous waste disposal guidelines dated prior to September 1966 and apply to all production areas, maintenance operations, and quality control laboratories within the facility perimeter.

All personnel involved in manufacturing operations, facility maintenance, and waste handling are required to familiarize themselves with these updated procedures and implement them immediately upon the effective date of October 1, 1966. Supervisory staff are responsible for ensuring compliance within their respective departments and for maintaining appropriate documentation of waste disposal activities.

## Classification of Waste Materials

### Category A - Solid Production Waste
Solid waste materials including defective packaging materials, trimmed plastic films, and rejected products shall be collected in designated metal containers located at each production line. These materials may be disposed of through regular municipal waste collection services or transported to approved solid waste disposal sites as determined by facility management.

### Category B - Chemical Solvents and Cleaning Agents
Waste solvents including but not limited to trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), methylene chloride, and other chlorinated compounds used in cleaning and degreasing operations require special handling procedures. These materials shall not be mixed with other waste categories and must be handled in accordance with the specific procedures outlined in Section IV of this memorandum.

### Category C - Contaminated Materials
Materials contaminated with chemical solvents, oils, or other industrial chemicals including rags, absorbent materials, and protective equipment shall be segregated from general waste and handled according to the procedures specified for contaminated waste disposal.

## Standard Disposal Procedures

### Solid Production Waste Disposal
Production waste classified as Category A may be collected and disposed of through the following approved methods:

1. **Municipal Collection**: Non-contaminated solid waste may be placed in designated areas for pickup by municipal waste collection services on scheduled collection days (Tuesdays and Fridays).

2. **Off-site Disposal**: Large quantities of solid waste may be transported by facility vehicles or contracted haulers to approved disposal sites including the Woburn Municipal Landfill on Montvale Avenue or other facilities as designated by management.

### Chemical Solvent Disposal Procedures
Effective October 1, 1966, waste solvents and chemical cleaning agents shall be disposed of using the following approved methods:

1. **On-site Disposal Area**: A designated disposal area has been established in the rear portion of the facility property, approximately 200 feet northeast of the main production building. This area, measuring approximately 50 feet by 30 feet, has been prepared with appropriate drainage considerations to accommodate liquid waste disposal.

2. **Direct Ground Application**: Waste solvents may be applied directly to the ground surface within the designated disposal area. The natural soil conditions in this area provide adequate absorption capacity for the volumes of waste solvents generated by normal facility operations.

3. **Lagoon System**: A shallow lagoon system has been constructed within the disposal area to contain larger volumes of liquid waste. The lagoon, approximately 20 feet by 15 feet with a depth of 4 feet, allows for controlled disposal and natural evaporation of volatile compounds.

### Documentation Requirements
All waste disposal activities must be documented on Form CR-24 (Waste Disposal Log) and submitted to the Operations Manager on a weekly basis. Documentation shall include the date of disposal, type and estimated quantity of materials disposed, disposal method used, and the signature of the responsible supervisor.

## Safety Considerations

Personnel involved in waste disposal activities are required to wear appropriate protective equipment including rubber gloves and safety glasses when handling chemical solvents. Smoking is prohibited within 100 feet of any waste disposal area.

In the event of accidental spills during waste handling or disposal operations, the affected area should be covered with absorbent materials and the incident reported to the facility safety officer immediately.

## Regulatory Compliance

These procedures have been developed in consideration of applicable state and local regulations regarding industrial waste disposal. The facility maintains appropriate permits and authorizations for waste disposal activities as required by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and local municipal authorities.

Staff are reminded that proper waste disposal practices are essential for maintaining our facility's good standing with regulatory authorities and for protecting the health and safety of our employees and the surrounding community.

## Implementation and Training

Supervisory staff in all departments are responsible for conducting training sessions with their personnel to ensure understanding of these updated procedures. Training must be completed by September 30, 1966, and attendance records maintained in department files.

Any questions regarding these procedures should be directed to the Operations Manager or the facility safety officer. Updates or modifications to these procedures will be communicated through official memoranda and posted on department bulletin boards.

## Effective Date

These updated waste disposal procedures become effective October 1, 1966, and remain in effect until superseded by subsequent policy updates. All previous waste disposal guidelines are hereby rescinded.
