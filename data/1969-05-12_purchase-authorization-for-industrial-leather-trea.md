# PURCHASE AUTHORIZATION REQUEST

**TO:** Corporate Procurement Division, Beatrice Foods Company  
**FROM:** John J. Riley, Plant Manager, Riley Tannery Operations  
**DATE:** May 12, 1969  
**RE:** Authorization for Industrial Chemical Supply Purchase - Q2 1969

## Request Summary

I am submitting this purchase authorization request for approval of chemical supplies necessary for our leather treatment operations at the Riley Tannery facility located at 328 Salem Street, Woburn, Massachusetts. The requested materials are essential for maintaining our production schedule and meeting delivery commitments to our footwear and leather goods clients.

## Requested Chemical Supplies

The following industrial chemicals are required for our Q2 1969 operations:

**Primary Solvents:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE) - 2,500 gallons at $0.48/gallon = $1,200.00
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) - 1,800 gallons at $0.52/gallon = $936.00
- Carbon Tetrachloride - 1,200 gallons at $0.44/gallon = $528.00

**Degreasing Compounds:**
- Industrial Methylene Chloride - 800 gallons at $0.56/gallon = $448.00
- Benzene-based degreaser concentrate - 600 gallons at $0.62/gallon = $372.00

**Treatment Chemicals:**
- Chromium sulfate solution - 1,000 pounds at $0.18/pound = $180.00
- Sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) - 2,000 pounds at $0.12/pound = $240.00
- Sulfuric acid concentrate - 500 gallons at $0.28/gallon = $140.00

**Total Requested Authorization:** $4,044.00

## Operational Justification

Our leather processing operations require these chemical supplies to maintain the quality standards demanded by our clients in the footwear manufacturing sector. The trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are particularly critical for our degreasing processes, which prepare raw hides for treatment. Without adequate supplies of these solvents, we risk production delays that could impact delivery schedules for our major accounts, including contracts with regional shoe manufacturers that represent approximately 60% of our quarterly revenue.

The chromium-based treatment solutions are essential for our leather tanning processes, producing the durable, water-resistant leather products that have established our reputation in the Massachusetts leather goods market. These chemicals allow us to process approximately 1,200 hides per month, maintaining our position as a reliable supplier to local manufacturers.

## Storage and Handling Procedures

All chemical supplies will be stored in our existing chemical storage facility located in the rear section of our property. Our current storage capacity accommodates the requested quantities with appropriate safety margins. Handling procedures follow standard industry practices, with designated personnel trained in proper chemical handling techniques.

Waste materials from the treatment processes are managed through our established disposal procedures, which include temporary storage in designated areas before removal by approved waste handling contractors. This system has been effective in managing our operational waste streams while maintaining compliance with local regulations.

## Vendor Information

We have obtained competitive quotes from three approved chemical suppliers:

1. **Northeast Chemical Supply Corp.** (Boston, MA) - Primary vendor recommendation
2. **Industrial Solvents Inc.** (Worcester, MA) - Secondary option
3. **Bay State Chemical Distribution** (Springfield, MA) - Backup supplier

Northeast Chemical Supply has provided the most competitive pricing and maintains reliable delivery schedules that align with our production requirements. They have been our primary chemical supplier for the past eighteen months and have consistently met our quality and delivery standards.

## Budget Impact

This purchase authorization fits within our approved Q2 1969 operational budget allocation of $12,500 for chemical supplies. The requested $4,044.00 represents approximately 32% of our quarterly chemical budget, leaving adequate reserves for additional purchases that may be required based on production demands or market opportunities.

## Recommendation

I recommend immediate approval of this purchase authorization to ensure uninterrupted production capabilities. Delays in chemical supply procurement could result in production bottlenecks that would negatively impact our delivery commitments and potentially damage client relationships that are crucial to our market position.

The requested chemicals are standard industrial materials used throughout the leather processing industry, and the quantities requested are consistent with our historical usage patterns and current production forecasts. Approval of this authorization will support our continued operations and maintain our competitive position in the regional leather goods market.

## Required Approvals

This purchase authorization requires approval from:
- Corporate Procurement Division
- Regional Operations Manager
- Financial Controller (for budget verification)

Upon receipt of the necessary approvals, I will proceed with placing orders with Northeast Chemical Supply Corp. to ensure timely delivery and maintain our production schedule.

Please contact me at the Riley Tannery facility (telephone: MAyfair 4-7892) if additional information is required to process this authorization request.
