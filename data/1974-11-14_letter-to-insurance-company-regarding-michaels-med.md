Dear Claims Representative,

I am writing to you regarding the outstanding medical bills for my son Michael Zona, who passed away on February 23, 1974, after a courageous battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Michael was covered under my Blue Cross Blue Shield policy (Policy Number: BC-4471892-A) through my employment, and I am seeking resolution of several unpaid claims that have been denied or remain in processing.

Michael was diagnosed with leukemia in June 1973 at the age of six, and from that point forward, our family faced not only the devastating emotional impact of watching our youngest child fight this terrible disease, but also the mounting financial burden of his medical care. Over the course of his twenty-month treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital, Michael underwent extensive chemotherapy, radiation treatments, numerous blood transfusions, and required multiple hospitalizations. The total medical expenses exceeded $18,000, a sum that represents nearly two years of my salary and has placed our family in severe financial hardship.

I have submitted claims totaling $12,847.63 for Michael's treatment, but have received denials on several major items including his extended hospital stay in January 1974 ($2,100), specialized blood work performed by Dr. Richardson's hematology laboratory ($890), and the experimental chemotherapy protocol administered during his final weeks ($1,450). The denial letters cite "experimental treatment" and "non-covered services," but I want to emphasize that every single treatment Michael received was prescribed by his oncologist, Dr. Margaret Walsh, as medically necessary for his condition. These were not elective procedures or experimental treatments chosen by our family—they were the standard of care recommended by one of Boston's most respected children's hospitals.

Our family has already paid $6,200 out of pocket for Michael's medical expenses, depleting our savings and forcing us to take out a second mortgage on our home. Joan has had to take on additional work cleaning houses in the evenings to help cover the costs, while I have been working overtime whenever possible. We have four other children to support—Patricia, age 16, Anthony, age 14, Thomas, age 12, and Lisa, age 9—and their needs cannot be ignored while we struggle to pay for Michael's medical bills. Patricia will be graduating from Woburn High School next year and hopes to attend nursing school, but we may not be able to help her with tuition if these medical debts continue to mount.

I am particularly frustrated by the denial of coverage for Michael's hospitalization from January 8-28, 1974. Your claims representative stated that the twenty-day stay was "excessive" for his condition, but Michael was critically ill during this period and required intensive monitoring and treatment. He had developed complications from his chemotherapy that required immediate medical intervention, and Dr. Walsh has provided documentation confirming that every day of his hospitalization was medically necessary. To suggest that we kept our dying child in the hospital longer than needed is both insulting and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of his medical situation.

The blood work performed by Dr. Richardson's laboratory has also been denied as "duplicate testing," but these specialized tests were ordered because the standard blood panels were insufficient to monitor Michael's response to the new chemotherapy protocol. Dr. Walsh specifically requested these tests because Michael's white cell counts were fluctuating in ways that required more detailed analysis than routine blood work could provide. These tests were not duplicates—they were specialized diagnostic tools essential to managing his care during a critical phase of his treatment.

Regarding the experimental chemotherapy protocol, I want to clarify that this was not an experimental treatment in the sense of an unproven therapy. This was a newer chemotherapy combination that had shown promise in treating children with Michael's specific type of leukemia, and Dr. Walsh recommended it when the standard protocols were no longer effective. We were not participating in a research study—we were following our doctor's recommendation for the best available treatment for our son's condition. The fact that this protocol was newer does not make it experimental or non-covered under our policy.

I am requesting that Blue Cross Blue Shield reconsider these denied claims and approve payment for Michael's medical expenses. I have enclosed copies of all medical records, doctor's notes, and hospital documentation supporting the necessity of every treatment and service provided. Dr. Walsh has also provided a detailed letter explaining Michael's medical condition and the rationale for each aspect of his care, which I hope will help clarify any questions about the appropriateness of his treatment.

Our family is still grieving the loss of our son, and dealing with these insurance disputes while trying to heal from our tragedy has been incredibly difficult. Michael fought his illness with remarkable courage and strength, never complaining about the painful treatments or lengthy hospital stays. He deserved the best medical care available, and that is what we provided for him. Now we are asking that Blue Cross Blue Shield honor its commitment to cover the medical expenses incurred in trying to save his life.

I have been a policyholder with Blue Cross Blue Shield for over twelve years and have always paid my premiums on time. During all those years, our family rarely used our insurance coverage beyond routine checkups and minor illnesses. When we finally needed the comprehensive coverage we had been paying for, we expected the insurance company to fulfill its obligations. The financial stress of these unpaid medical bills, combined with our grief over losing Michael, has put tremendous strain on our entire family.

I am requesting a prompt review of these denied claims and ask that payment be issued within thirty days. If additional documentation is needed, please contact me immediately so we can resolve this matter quickly. I can be reached at my home phone number, 617-933-7421, during evening hours, or through my employer, Woburn Manufacturing Company, during the day at 617-933-2100.

I sincerely hope that Blue Cross Blue Shield will reconsider these claims and provide the coverage that our family deserves during this difficult time. Michael's medical care was appropriate, necessary, and prescribed by qualified physicians at a reputable hospital. The financial burden of his illness should not continue to impact our family's ability to move forward and care for our other children.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon regarding the resolution of these outstanding claims.

Sincerely,

Pat Zona
