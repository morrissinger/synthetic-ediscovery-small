# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Water Treatment Plant Operators - All Shifts  
**FROM:** Robert P. Sullivan, Superintendent  
**DATE:** February 22, 1977  
**RE:** Wells G and H Activation Order for Cold Weather Water Demand

Due to increased municipal water demand resulting from the current cold weather conditions and frozen service lines throughout the city, I am hereby ordering the immediate activation of Wells G and H to supplement our primary water supply sources. This directive is effective immediately and shall remain in force until further notice.

The prolonged sub-zero temperatures over the past ten days have resulted in numerous frozen pipes and increased water usage as residents run faucets to prevent freezing. Our monitoring stations indicate that demand has exceeded normal winter consumption by approximately 23%, straining our primary wells beyond their optimal operating capacity. Wells G and H, located on the Aberjona River wellfield, provide our most reliable backup capacity and must be brought online to maintain adequate water pressure throughout the distribution system.

All operators are instructed to monitor water quality parameters in accordance with standard operating procedures. Wells G and H have consistently met all state and federal water quality standards since their installation in 1964 and 1966 respectively. The treatment facility chlorination systems are functioning within normal parameters, and routine bacteriological testing continues to show compliance with all health department requirements.

Given the critical nature of maintaining uninterrupted water service during these extreme weather conditions, Wells G and H shall operate at full capacity until temperatures moderate and water demand returns to normal seasonal levels. Any operational concerns or equipment malfunctions should be reported immediately to the duty supervisor. The city's residents depend on our reliable service, particularly during emergency weather conditions when water access becomes even more essential for public health and safety.

Superintendent  
Woburn Water Department
