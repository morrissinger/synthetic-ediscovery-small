# MEDICAL EXPERT OPINION
## Trichloroethylene Exposure and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Causation

**TO:** Jan Schlichtmann, Esq.  
**FROM:** Dr. Medical Expert, M.D., Ph.D.  
**DATE:** March 5, 1982  
**RE:** Medical Causation Analysis - James Anderson and TCE Exposure

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on my review of the medical literature, toxicological studies, and case-specific evidence regarding James Anderson's exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) through the contaminated municipal water supply from Wells G and H in Woburn, Massachusetts, it is my professional medical opinion that the chronic exposure to these chlorinated solvents was a substantial contributing factor in the development of James Anderson's acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and subsequent death on January 18, 1981.

## QUALIFICATIONS AND METHODOLOGY

I am a board-certified physician specializing in hematology and oncology with particular expertise in environmental carcinogenesis. I hold an M.D. from Harvard Medical School (1965) and a Ph.D. in Environmental Toxicology from Johns Hopkins University (1970). I have published extensively on the relationship between industrial chemical exposures and childhood leukemias, including peer-reviewed articles in the New England Journal of Medicine, Environmental Health Perspectives, and the American Journal of Epidemiology.

My analysis is based on:
- Review of James Anderson's complete medical records from 1972-1981
- Analysis of water quality data from Wells G and H (1964-1979)
- Comprehensive review of current scientific literature on TCE carcinogenicity
- Evaluation of exposure pathways and dose-response relationships
- Assessment of temporal relationships between exposure and disease onset

## EXPOSURE ANALYSIS

### Chemical Contamination Profile

Wells G and H, which supplied water to the Anderson residence at 11 Orange Street, contained documented contamination levels of:
- **Trichloroethylene (TCE):** Up to 400 parts per billion (ppb)
- **Tetrachloroethylene (PCE):** Up to 43 ppb

These concentrations represent significant exceedances of health-protective levels. The current EPA action level for TCE of 5 ppb corresponds to a theoretical cancer risk of one additional case per million exposed individuals. At 400 ppb, the contamination level in Woburn's water supply was 80 times this protective standard.

### Exposure Duration and Timing

James Anderson's exposure profile demonstrates the most concerning pattern from a carcinogenesis standpoint:

1. **Prenatal Exposure:** Anne Anderson consumed contaminated water throughout her pregnancy (1968), exposing the developing fetus during critical organogenesis
2. **Infancy and Early Childhood:** Continuous exposure from birth through age 3 (1968-1971), during periods of rapid cellular division and immune system development
3. **Chronic Exposure:** Sustained exposure until leukemia diagnosis in January 1972

The timing is particularly significant because the latency period between initial exposure and leukemia diagnosis (approximately 3-4 years) is consistent with established patterns for chemically-induced childhood leukemias.

## TOXICOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT

### Carcinogenic Properties of TCE

Recent toxicological studies have established trichloroethylene as a probable human carcinogen with particular affinity for hematopoietic tissues:

1. **Animal Studies:** Laboratory studies in mice and rats demonstrate increased incidence of lymphomas and leukemias following chronic TCE exposure
2. **Occupational Studies:** Industrial workers exposed to TCE show elevated rates of hematopoietic malignancies
3. **Metabolic Pathway:** TCE metabolism produces reactive intermediates that can damage DNA in bone marrow cells

### Mechanism of Action

TCE exerts its carcinogenic effects through multiple pathways relevant to leukemia development:

- **DNA Damage:** Metabolites of TCE, particularly trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid, are genotoxic and can cause chromosomal aberrations
- **Immune Suppression:** TCE exposure compromises immune surveillance mechanisms that normally eliminate pre-malignant cells
- **Bone Marrow Toxicity:** Direct toxic effects on hematopoietic stem cells increase susceptibility to malignant transformation

### Dose-Response Relationship

The concentration of TCE in Wells G and H (400 ppb) falls within the range associated with increased cancer risk in epidemiological studies. Assuming typical water consumption patterns for a young child (1-2 liters per day), James Anderson's daily TCE intake would have been approximately 0.4-0.8 milligrams, representing a significant toxic burden for a developing child.

## MEDICAL CAUSATION ANALYSIS

### Temporal Relationship

The temporal sequence strongly supports a causal relationship:
- **1964-1966:** Wells G and H begin operation, introducing contaminated water to the Anderson household
- **1968:** James Anderson born; prenatal exposure established
- **1968-1972:** Continuous exposure during critical developmental period
- **January 1972:** Diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia at age 3

This timeline demonstrates the biologically plausible latency period for chemical carcinogenesis in childhood leukemia.

### Biological Plausibility

The development of ALL in James Anderson is entirely consistent with known effects of TCE exposure:

1. **Target Organ:** TCE preferentially affects hematopoietic tissues
2. **Age Susceptibility:** Children are more vulnerable to chemical carcinogens due to rapid cell division and immature detoxification systems
3. **Exposure Route:** Ingestion of contaminated water provides systemic distribution to bone marrow

### Alternative Causation Analysis

While acute lymphocytic leukemia can occur spontaneously, several factors support environmental causation in this case:

- **Geographic Clustering:** Multiple cases of childhood leukemia in the same neighborhood served by Wells G and H
- **Timing:** Disease onset coincided with period of highest contamination levels
- **Family History:** No documented genetic predisposition to leukemia in the Anderson family

## CONSCIOUS PAIN AND SUFFERING ASSESSMENT

James Anderson's medical records document extensive conscious pain and suffering directly attributable to his leukemia and its treatment from January 1972 until his death in January 1981:

### Treatment-Related Suffering
- Multiple hospitalizations for chemotherapy administration
- Bone marrow aspirations and lumbar punctures
- Severe nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy
- Hair loss and physical weakness
- Frequent infections due to immunosuppression

### Disease-Related Pain
- Bone pain associated with leukemic infiltration
- Fatigue and malaise from anemia
- Bleeding episodes from thrombocytopenia
- Progressive deterioration in final months

The medical records clearly document that James was conscious and aware of his suffering throughout the nine-year course of his illness, experiencing both physical pain and the psychological trauma of chronic life-threatening disease.

## CONCLUSIONS AND MEDICAL OPINIONS

Based on my analysis of the scientific evidence, exposure data, and medical records, I offer the following opinions to a reasonable degree of medical certainty:

### Primary Causation Opinion
The chronic exposure to trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene through the contaminated municipal water supply from Wells G and H was a substantial contributing factor in the development of James Anderson's acute lymphocytic leukemia. The exposure levels, timing, duration, and biological mechanisms support a causal relationship between the chemical contamination and the disease.

### Wrongful Death Causation
James Anderson's death on January 18, 1981, was directly caused by complications of acute lymphocytic leukemia, which developed as a result of his exposure to carcinogenic solvents in the municipal water supply. But for this exposure, James Anderson would not have developed leukemia and would not have died at age 12.

### Conscious Pain and Suffering Causation
The extensive pain and suffering experienced by James Anderson from January 1972 until his death was directly caused by the leukemia that developed as a result of his exposure to TCE and PCE. This suffering was prolonged, severe, and documented in the medical records,
