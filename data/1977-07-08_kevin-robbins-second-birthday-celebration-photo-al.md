# Kevin's Second Birthday - July 8, 1977

*A Photo Album by Donna Robbins*

## Our Little Birthday Boy

What a wonderful day we had celebrating Kevin's second birthday! I wanted to put together this little album to remember all the special moments from today. Carl keeps saying I take too many pictures, but I know we'll treasure these memories forever, especially as Kevin grows up so fast.

Kevin woke up this morning at 6:30 AM - earlier than usual, almost like he knew it was his special day! He came running into our bedroom calling "Mama! Dada!" with that big smile of his. Carl groaned about the early hour, but I could tell he was just as excited as I was. We've been planning this party for weeks, and after everything our family has been through this past year, we wanted to make sure Kevin had the most perfect second birthday celebration.

## The Morning Preparations

I spent the morning in the kitchen preparing Kevin's favorite foods while he played with his blocks in the living room. Mrs. Anderson from next door stopped by around 9:00 AM to drop off a casserole for the party - she's been such a blessing to our family, especially during Carl's treatments. She mentioned that little Jimmy has been asking about Kevin and is excited to play together at the party. It's so wonderful how the children in our neighborhood have become such close friends.

Carl helped me hang the streamers and balloons in the backyard while Kevin napped. We used his favorite colors - blue and yellow - and strung them between the maple trees. The weather cooperated beautifully today, sunny and warm but not too hot. Perfect for an outdoor celebration. Carl seemed to have good energy today, which has been a real blessing. Some days are harder than others, but today he was determined to make Kevin's day special.

## The Birthday Party

**Photo 1:** *Kevin in his high chair wearing his new blue overalls and striped shirt, clapping his hands as we brought out his birthday cake*

The look of pure joy on his face when he saw that chocolate cake with two candles! I made it from scratch using my mother's recipe - the same one she used for Carl's birthdays when he was little. Kevin's eyes got so wide, and he started bouncing in his chair and saying "Cake! Cake!" He's really starting to talk more now, picking up new words every day.

**Photo 2:** *All the neighborhood children gathered around Kevin as he tries to blow out his candles*

We had such a nice group of friends join us. The Kane family came with little Kevin Jr., who's just a few months older than our Kevin. The two Kevins always have such fun playing together - they're going to be best friends growing up, I just know it. The Toomey family brought Patrick, and the Gamaches came with Roland. It's so heartwarming to see all these children playing together, laughing and running around the backyard.

**Photo 3:** *Kevin opening his presents with help from Daddy*

Carl sat right next to Kevin helping him unwrap each gift. Kevin got so excited about the wrapping paper that he almost forgot about the presents inside! His favorite gift was definitely the wooden truck that Carl's brother Mike sent from California. Kevin immediately started pushing it around the patio, making little "vroom vroom" sounds. He also loved the picture books from the Andersons and the stuffed bear from the Kanes.

## Afternoon Fun

After cake and presents, I set up the sprinkler for the children to run through. What a sight that was! Kevin in his little swimming trunks, squealing with delight every time the water hit him. All the children were laughing and splashing, their parents sitting in lawn chairs watching and chatting. These are the moments that make all the challenges worthwhile.

**Photo 5:** *Kevin and Kevin Jr. sharing a piece of birthday cake*

The two Kevins sat together on the picnic blanket, both with chocolate cake smeared on their faces and hands. They were chattering away to each other in that special language that only toddlers understand. Joan Kane and I couldn't stop laughing at how serious they looked, like they were having the most important conversation in the world.

## Evening Wind-Down

After all the guests went home and we cleaned up, Carl sat with Kevin in the living room for their evening story time. Kevin was still clutching his new wooden truck, rolling it back and forth on the carpet while Carl read from one of his new picture books. These quiet moments together are just as precious as the big celebrations.

## Reflections on Our Little Boy

As I write this tonight after putting Kevin to bed, I'm filled with such gratitude for this beautiful day and for our healthy, happy little boy. At two years old, Kevin is such a bright, curious child. He loves books, trucks, and playing outside. He's starting to sing along with songs on the radio, and his favorite is "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star." He's also becoming quite the little helper, always wanting to "help" Mama in the kitchen or "help" Daddy with his tools.

Living here in East Woburn has been wonderful for raising Kevin. Our neighborhood is full of young families, and the children all play together like one big extended family. The elementary school is just a few blocks away, and there are plenty of parks and safe streets for children to ride their bicycles when they get older.

**Photo 7:** *Kevin asleep in his crib, still holding his wooden truck*

This last photo captures how the day ended - our little birthday boy fast asleep, exhausted from all the excitement but still holding onto his favorite new toy. Carl and I stood in the doorway for a few minutes just watching him sleep, counting our blessings.

## Looking Forward

As Kevin grows, I want him to know how much love surrounded him on his second birthday. I want him to remember the friends who celebrated with him, the neighbors who became like family, and the community that welcomed him with open arms. East Woburn is a special place to raise children, and I know Kevin will have many more wonderful birthdays here.

Carl and I are already talking about what we'll do for his third birthday next year. Maybe we'll have it at the park if the weather's nice, or perhaps we'll finally finish the basement and have it downstairs if it rains. Whatever we do, I know it will be filled with the same love and joy that made today so perfect.

**Photo 8:** *The whole family - Carl, Donna, and Kevin - sitting together on the front porch as the sun sets*

This final photo was taken by Mrs. Anderson just before everyone went home. The three of us sitting on our front porch, Kevin on Carl's lap, all of us smiling and happy. This is what family looks like. This is what home feels like. This is what we'll remember about July 8, 1977 - the day our little boy turned two and filled our hearts with so much joy.
