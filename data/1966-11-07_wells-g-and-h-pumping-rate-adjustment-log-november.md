## OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Short-Term (Next 30 Days)
1. Continue monitoring Well H pump motor for any recurring vibration issues
2. Maintain current pumping rates unless demand patterns change significantly
3. Schedule backup generator test for December 1st preparations
4. Review winter operation procedures with all shift operators

### Long-Term Planning
1. Consider installation of automatic flow monitoring equipment for improved system oversight
2. Evaluate need for additional storage capacity given increasing East Woburn development
3. Plan for spring 1967 comprehensive well testing and maintenance program
4. Review adequacy of current pumping capacity for projected 1967-1968 demand
