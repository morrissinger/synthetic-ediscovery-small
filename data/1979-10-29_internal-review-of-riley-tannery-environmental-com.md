## INTERNAL COMPLIANCE REVIEW REPORT

**TO:** Beatrice Foods Legal Department  
**FROM:** Thomas Bradley, Environmental Compliance Officer  
**DATE:** October 29, 1979  
**RE:** Internal Review of Riley Tannery Environmental Compliance Records

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents findings from a comprehensive internal review of environmental compliance records for the John J. Riley Company tannery facility at 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts. The review was conducted in response to recent developments regarding municipal water well contamination in the East Woburn area and potential regulatory scrutiny of industrial operations in the Aberjona River Valley.

The Riley tannery, acquired by Beatrice Foods Inc. in 1978, has operated continuously since 1954 under various ownership structures. Our review examined waste disposal practices, chemical usage records, and environmental monitoring data from 1965 through present operations. Additionally, we assessed the 14.73-acre undeveloped parcel adjacent to the tannery property that has been utilized for various disposal activities.

## BACKGROUND AND FACILITY OPERATIONS

The John J. Riley Company operates as a leather tanning and processing facility serving industrial and commercial markets throughout New England. The facility processes approximately 2,000 hides per week using traditional tanning methods that require substantial quantities of chromium compounds, acids, and organic solvents.

Primary chemical usage includes:
- Chromium sulfate for tanning processes (approximately 15 tons monthly)
- Sulfuric acid for hide preparation (8-10 tons monthly)
- Trichloroethylene for degreasing operations (200-300 gallons monthly)
- Various organic dyes and finishing compounds

The facility generates liquid waste streams containing high concentrations of chromium, organic compounds, and suspended solids. Historical disposal methods have included on-site lagoons, subsurface disposal systems, and utilization of the adjacent undeveloped parcel for solid waste disposal.

## REVIEW METHODOLOGY

Our internal review examined the following documentation and physical evidence:

1. **Waste Disposal Records (1965-1979):** Reviewed available shipping manifests, disposal contracts, and internal waste tracking documentation
2. **Chemical Purchase Records:** Analyzed procurement records for trichloroethylene, chromium compounds, and other process chemicals
3. **Site Inspection:** Physical examination of disposal areas, lagoons, and the adjacent 14.73-acre parcel
4. **Regulatory Correspondence:** Review of all communications with Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering and federal agencies
5. **Employee Interviews:** Discussions with long-term facility personnel regarding historical disposal practices

## KEY FINDINGS

### Waste Disposal Practices

Our review identified several areas of concern regarding historical waste disposal practices at the Riley facility:

**On-Site Lagoon System:** The facility has operated three unlined lagoons for liquid waste treatment since approximately 1966. These lagoons, located in the southeastern portion of the property, received process wastewater containing chromium concentrations ranging from 50-200 mg/L based on available testing records. No impermeable liner system was installed beneath these lagoons during their construction.

**Adjacent Parcel Utilization:** The 14.73-acre undeveloped parcel has been utilized for disposal of solid waste materials including leather scraps, sludge from lagoon cleaning operations, and containers that previously held trichloroethylene and other solvents. Site inspection revealed numerous buried containers and areas of stained soil indicating chemical disposal activities.

**Solvent Disposal:** Records indicate that spent trichloroethylene and other organic solvents were disposed of through various methods including:
- Direct discharge to on-site lagoons (1965-1972)
- Burial in containers on the adjacent parcel (1968-1975)
- Off-site disposal through commercial waste haulers (1975-present)

### Regulatory Compliance Issues

**Permit Status:** The facility has operated without specific discharge permits for the lagoon system. Massachusetts regulations implemented in 1972 required discharge permits for industrial wastewater, but the Riley facility continued operations under claimed grandfather provisions.

**Monitoring Requirements:** Limited environmental monitoring has been conducted. Groundwater monitoring wells were not installed until 1978, and testing has been irregular. Available groundwater samples from monitoring well RW-1 (installed September 1978) show trichloroethylene concentrations of 45 μg/L and chromium levels of 180 μg/L.

**Reporting Obligations:** Several incidents involving chemical spills and releases were not reported to regulatory authorities as required under Massachusetts environmental regulations implemented in 1976.

## POTENTIAL LEGAL EXPOSURE

Based on our review, several areas of potential legal exposure have been identified:

### Environmental Contamination Claims

The proximity of the Riley facility to municipal Wells G and H (approximately 1,200 feet southwest) creates potential liability for groundwater contamination. Recent testing of these wells revealed trichloroethylene contamination, and the facility's historical use and disposal of this chemical creates a potential causal connection.

Chromium contamination in facility groundwater monitoring wells indicates migration of contaminants from on-site disposal areas. The unlined lagoon system and burial activities on the adjacent parcel represent potential sources of continuing contamination.

### Regulatory Violations

Operation without proper discharge permits since 1972 constitutes ongoing violations of Massachusetts environmental regulations. Failure to report chemical releases and spills represents additional regulatory compliance issues that could result in enforcement actions and penalties.

### Third-Party Claims

The recent closure of municipal Wells G and H due to contamination has created public awareness of groundwater quality issues in East Woburn. Property owners and residents served by these wells may pursue claims for property damage, health effects, and other damages allegedly caused by industrial contamination.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions

1. **Retain Environmental Counsel:** Engage specialized environmental legal counsel to assess potential liability and develop defensive strategies for anticipated regulatory and third-party claims.

2. **Comprehensive Site Investigation:** Conduct thorough environmental site assessment including soil and groundwater sampling to define the extent of contamination and potential migration pathways.

3. **Document Preservation:** Implement comprehensive document retention procedures to preserve all records related to chemical usage, waste disposal, and environmental monitoring.

4. **Employee Communication:** Provide guidance to facility personnel regarding communications with regulatory agencies, media, and potential claimants.

### Long-Term Compliance Strategy

1. **Permit Applications:** Submit discharge permit applications to Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering for all current waste streams.

2. **Remediation Planning:** Develop preliminary remediation plans for contaminated areas to demonstrate good faith compliance efforts.

3. **Insurance Coverage Review:** Evaluate existing general liability and environmental insurance coverage for potential contamination claims.

4. **Operational Modifications:** Implement improved chemical handling and waste disposal procedures to prevent future contamination incidents.

## CONCLUSION

The Riley tannery facility presents significant environmental liability exposure due to historical waste disposal practices and proximity to contaminated municipal water wells. The combination of unlined waste lagoons, chemical disposal on the adjacent parcel, and limited environmental monitoring creates multiple potential sources of legal claims.

Immediate action is required to address regulatory compliance issues and prepare for potential enforcement actions and third-party litigation. The recent closure of Wells G and H has created a heightened regulatory and public awareness environment that increases the likelihood of formal investigations and legal proceedings.
