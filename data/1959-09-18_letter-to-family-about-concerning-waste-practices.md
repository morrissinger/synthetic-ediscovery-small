# Letter to Family About Concerning Waste Practices at Work

September 18, 1959

My Dearest Margaret,

I hope this letter finds you and the children in good health. Little Bobby's cough has been on my mind all day, and I pray it clears up soon. Please give him an extra hug from his papa tonight.

I'm writing to you about something that's been troubling me greatly at the tannery. You know I've never been one to complain about honest work, and Mr. Riley has been fair to me these past twelve years. But Margaret, I've been seeing things at the plant that don't sit right with my conscience, especially knowing our neighbors depend on the water from those new wells they're talking about drilling near the Aberjona.

For months now, I've watched the foremen direct us to dump the waste chemicals directly into the ground behind the main building. We're talking about barrels and barrels of the stuff we use to treat the hides - chromium solutions, sulfuric acid, and Lord knows what other chemicals. The smell alone would knock you over. When I asked Jimmy Sullivan about it last week, he just shrugged and said "orders from above." But Margaret, this isn't right. The ground back there is saturated with chemicals. After a heavy rain, you can see the rainbow slick on top of the puddles, and the soil has turned this sickly orange color that ain't natural.

What worries me most is that the waste pit they've got us using is maybe two hundred yards from where they say they might put in new water wells for the town. I've been at this tannery long enough to know that what goes into the ground doesn't just disappear. My father worked the mills in Lawrence, and he used to tell stories about how the river would change colors depending on what the factories were running that day. But this is different, Margaret. This is going right into the earth where people might be drawing their drinking water.

Yesterday, I worked up the courage to speak with Mr. Riley directly. I found him in his office going over the books, and I asked him respectful-like about the waste disposal. He looked at me with those cold eyes of his and said, "McCarthy, you're paid to work leather, not to think about waste. The chemicals break down in the soil naturally. That's what the state inspector told me." But I've seen that state inspector, Margaret - he comes by maybe once a year, spends an hour walking around the front of the building, shakes hands with Mr. Riley, and drives away in his fancy Buick. He's never once been back to where we dump the chemicals.

I've been losing sleep over this, especially thinking about the Kowalski family and the Andersons who live just down Salem Street from the plant. Their children play in those woods behind the tannery sometimes. Little Anne Anderson is just Bobby's age. What if those chemicals are seeping into the ground where those children play? What if they're moving toward the water table that feeds the wells the town is planning?

The other workers have noticed my concerns, and some of them share them. Old Pete Kowalski pulled me aside during lunch break and told me he's been finding dead fish in the Aberjona River downstream from where our waste flows after heavy rains. He said his wife won't let their children near the river anymore because of the strange smell. But Pete's got six children to feed, and jobs aren't easy to come by in Woburn. None of us can afford to make waves that might cost us our positions.

I know you'll tell me to do what's right, because that's the kind of woman you are. But I'm torn, Margaret. We need this job, especially with another baby coming. The mortgage on the house won't pay itself, and Bobby will need new shoes for school soon. If I push too hard on this waste business, Mr. Riley might let me go, and then where would we be? But if I say nothing, and something terrible happens to the water or to the children in the neighborhood, how could I live with myself?

I've been thinking about writing a letter to the Board of Health, but I don't even know if they'd listen to a tannery worker. And if word got back to Mr. Riley that I was the one who complained, I'd be out on the street faster than you could say Jack Robinson. Maybe I could talk to Father O'Brien about it. He might know what a man should do in a situation like this.

For now, I'm keeping my eyes open and my mouth mostly shut, but it's eating at me something fierce. I see those barrels of chemicals going into the ground day after day, and I think about our neighbors, about their children, about the water they'll be drinking. A man should be able to do an honest day's work without worrying that he's helping to poison his own community.

Please don't worry yourself sick over this, my darling. I just needed to tell someone who would understand. Kiss the children for me, and tell them papa will be home for supper tomorrow night. Maybe by then I'll have figured out the right thing to do.

All my love,

Thomas

P.S. - Don't mention any of this to the neighbors just yet. I need to think more about how to handle this situation properly.
