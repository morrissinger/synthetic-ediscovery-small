# Letter to Extended Family Regarding Carl's Diagnosis and Treatment

**October 15, 1976**

Dear Family,

I hope this letter finds you all in good health. I'm writing with a heavy heart to share some difficult news about our Carl. As some of you may have heard through the family grapevine, Carl has been diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital confirmed the diagnosis last month, and we wanted to reach out to everyone personally rather than let you hear bits and pieces from others.

Carl first started showing symptoms back in July—he was more tired than usual, had some bruising that wouldn't heal properly, and complained of his bones aching. At first, we thought it might just be growing pains or maybe he was coming down with something. You know how active he's always been, running around the neighborhood with the other kids, playing baseball in the vacant lot behind our house. But when the symptoms persisted and he started losing weight, we knew something wasn't right.

The diagnosis came as a complete shock to us. Carl is only eight years old—the same age as little Michael Zona was when he passed away two years ago. I don't know if you remember the Zonas from Christmas cards, but they live just a few streets over from us on Montvale Road. Their boy died from the same thing Carl has now. It's been weighing heavily on my mind, especially since we've heard there have been other children in our neighborhood who've gotten sick with similar illnesses. The Andersons lost their Jimmy just last year, and there's talk of other families dealing with the same heartbreak.

Carl started his treatment at Mass General three weeks ago. The chemotherapy is brutal—he's sick most days, barely keeping food down, and his beautiful blonde hair is starting to fall out. He tries to be brave about it, but I can see the fear in his eyes when we have to go to the hospital for treatments. The medical bills are already piling up, and we're looking at months or possibly years of this ahead of us. My husband has been working extra shifts at the plant, but the insurance only covers so much, and there are so many expenses they don't account for—the gas money for all the trips to Boston, the special foods Carl can keep down, the medications that aren't fully covered.

What breaks my heart most is watching Carl try to understand why this is happening to him. He asks me why he can't play with his friends anymore, why he has to spend so much time at the hospital, why his body hurts so much. How do you explain to an eight-year-old that his own blood is betraying him? The doctors say his white blood cell count was dangerously high when they first tested him, and they're working to get it under control, but the treatment itself makes him feel so awful that sometimes I wonder if we're doing the right thing putting him through all this suffering.

The nurses at Mass General have been wonderful, especially Mrs. Patterson on the pediatric oncology ward. She's helped Carl understand his treatment better and has been teaching him little tricks to manage the nausea. But even with all their kindness and expertise, every day is a struggle. Carl used to love going to school, playing with his model trains, and helping me in the garden. Now most days he doesn't have the energy to get out of bed, and when he does, he moves like an old man instead of the energetic boy he used to be.

I've been trying to stay strong for Carl and for my husband, but there are nights when I just sit at the kitchen table and cry. We moved to this neighborhood because it seemed like such a good place to raise children—quiet streets, good schools, other young families around. Now I can't help but wonder if there's something in our environment that's making these children sick. Three kids on practically the same few blocks, all with leukemia? It seems like more than just terrible luck.

The doctors haven't been able to give us any answers about what might have caused Carl's illness. They say sometimes these things just happen, that children can develop leukemia without any clear environmental cause. But when I think about Michael Zona and Jimmy Anderson and now Carl, all living so close to each other, all drinking the same water from the same wells, all breathing the same air, it's hard to accept that it's just coincidence.

We're taking this one day at a time, focusing on Carl's treatment and trying to maintain as much normalcy as possible for him. Some days are better than others—last week he actually felt well enough to work on a puzzle with me, and seeing him smile was worth everything. But the reality is that we're facing a long, difficult road ahead, and we don't know where it will lead.

I wanted to let you all know what we're going through because Carl has always loved his extended family so much. Your cards and letters mean the world to him, and to us. If you're planning to visit, please call first—Carl's immune system is compromised from the chemotherapy, so we have to be careful about exposures to germs. But he would love to hear from his cousins and aunts and uncles, even if it's just through letters or phone calls.

Please keep Carl in your prayers. We're hoping and praying that the treatment will work, that he'll be one of the lucky ones who beats this terrible disease. The doctors say that childhood leukemia has better survival rates now than it did even a few years ago, so we're trying to hold onto hope. But we also know that every day is precious, and we're trying to make the most of the time we have together as a family.

Thank you for your love and support during this difficult time. We'll keep you updated on Carl's progress, and we hope to see you all again soon under happier circumstances.

With love and gratitude,

Donna

P.S. If anyone asks about sending flowers or food, please know that we appreciate the thought, but Carl can't be around fresh flowers right now due to his treatments, and his appetite is so unpredictable that we're mostly just trying to get him to eat whatever appeals to him on any given day. Your prayers and kind thoughts are the best gifts you can give us right now.
