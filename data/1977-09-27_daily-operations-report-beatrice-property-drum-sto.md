# DAILY OPERATIONS REPORT
## BEATRICE FOODS COMPANY
### WOBURN FACILITY - DRUM STORAGE AREA

**TO:** Operations Manager, Beatrice Foods  
**FROM:** Riley Tannery Supervisor  
**DATE:** September 27, 1977  
**TIME:** 10:45 AM  
**RE:** Daily Operations Status - Drum Storage Area Inspection

---

## FACILITY STATUS OVERVIEW

This report documents the current operational status of the drum storage area located on the Beatrice Foods property at 364 Washington Street, Woburn, Massachusetts. Morning inspection conducted at 0800 hours revealed ongoing storage activities consistent with established protocols for industrial chemical containment.

The designated storage area currently houses approximately 240 drums containing various industrial solvents and chemical compounds from tannery operations. Storage configuration maintains standard spacing requirements with drums arranged in rows of twelve, separated by gravel pathways for equipment access. Visual inspection indicates structural integrity of storage containers remains adequate for continued use, though surface rust patterns on approximately 15% of older drums suggest normal weathering consistent with outdoor storage conditions.

## OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES

Morning activities included receipt of six new drums containing trichloroethylene (TCE) from our primary supplier, with delivery completed at 0930 hours. These containers have been placed in the northeast section of the storage area, maintaining required separation distances from other chemical classifications. Documentation indicates these drums contain industrial-grade TCE with 99.2% purity, suitable for degreasing operations in our leather processing facility.

Routine maintenance activities included inspection of the perimeter drainage system, which continues to function as designed to manage surface water runoff during precipitation events. The drainage channels direct water flow toward the natural depression area located approximately 200 yards southeast of the storage facility. This system has operated effectively throughout the current season, preventing accumulation of standing water around drum storage areas that could potentially compromise container integrity.

## ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATIONS

Weather conditions remain favorable for outdoor storage operations, with clear skies and temperatures reaching 68°F by mid-morning. Recent rainfall totaling 1.3 inches over the past week has tested our drainage systems, which performed adequately in managing surface water movement away from storage areas.

Soil conditions in the storage area appear stable, with no visible signs of settling or erosion that might affect drum placement or access routes. The gravel base installed in 1975 continues to provide adequate foundation support for storage operations and equipment movement. Regular grading maintains proper drainage slopes to prevent water accumulation around storage containers.

## PERSONNEL AND SAFETY NOTES

All personnel assigned to drum handling operations have completed required safety training protocols established by company policy. Morning briefing covered proper lifting techniques, chemical identification procedures, and emergency response protocols. No safety incidents or personnel injuries occurred during the reporting period.

Equipment inspection confirmed that all forklifts and handling equipment remain in proper working condition, with daily maintenance checks completed according to schedule. Personal protective equipment inventory remains adequate, with sufficient supplies of gloves, eye protection, and respiratory equipment available for all personnel.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Current storage activities continue to operate within established guidelines for industrial chemical storage as understood by facility management. All drums maintain proper labeling consistent with chemical identification requirements, and storage areas remain accessible for inspection purposes as needed.

Documentation of chemical inventory remains current, with daily logs recording additions, removals, and any changes in storage configuration. These records are maintained in the facility office and available for review by authorized personnel or regulatory representatives as required.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONTINUED OPERATIONS

Based on current operational status, I recommend continuation of existing storage protocols with attention to the following considerations:

**Immediate Actions:** Continue daily visual inspections of drum integrity, particularly focusing on older containers showing surface weathering. Maintain current spacing and organization to ensure adequate access for equipment and personnel movement.

**Preventive Measures:** Schedule quarterly inspection of drainage systems to ensure continued effectiveness in managing surface water. Consider rotation of older drums to prioritize use of containers showing signs of weathering before potential integrity issues develop.

**Long-term Planning:** Evaluate expansion of storage capacity to accommodate projected increases in chemical inventory associated with planned production increases. Current storage area approaches capacity limits during peak operational periods.

The drum storage area continues to serve operational requirements effectively while maintaining appropriate standards for chemical containment and personnel safety. Regular monitoring and maintenance activities support continued reliable operation of this essential facility component.
