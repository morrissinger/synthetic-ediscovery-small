## TRICHLOROETHYLENE CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS AND INVENTORY SUMMARY

**Report No.:** CRY-TCE-68-003  
**Classification:** Internal Use Only  
**Prepared by:** Dr. Robert M. Hartwell, Chemical Safety Officer  
**Date:** January 30, 1968

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of trichloroethylene (TCE) consumption patterns and inventory management at the Cryovac facility for the period January 1967 through December 1967. The analysis reveals significant increases in TCE usage correlating with expanded production of polymer films and packaging materials. Current inventory levels and disposal practices are evaluated against operational requirements and regulatory guidelines.

### INTRODUCTION

Trichloroethylene serves as a primary degreasing solvent in our manufacturing processes, particularly in the preparation of metal substrates for polymer coating applications and in the cleaning of production equipment. As production volumes have increased substantially over the past year, corresponding increases in solvent consumption necessitate careful monitoring of both supply requirements and waste management protocols.

This analysis was conducted in response to management's request for detailed consumption data following the implementation of new production lines in Building C and the expansion of our packaging operations. The data presented herein covers all TCE usage across our Waltham facility operations.

### METHODOLOGY

Data collection encompassed:

- **Purchase Records:** All TCE procurement from Dow Chemical Company and Allied Chemical Corporation
- **Usage Logs:** Daily consumption records from production departments
- **Inventory Tracking:** Monthly physical inventory counts of stored TCE
- **Waste Generation:** Volumes of spent solvent requiring disposal
- **Quality Control:** Purity testing results for incoming TCE shipments

Records were compiled from departmental logs maintained by production supervisors and cross-referenced with purchasing documentation and environmental compliance files.

### FINDINGS

#### Consumption Analysis

**Total Annual Consumption (1967):** 47,350 gallons

Monthly consumption patterns revealed:
- **Peak Usage:** August-October (4,200-4,800 gallons/month)
- **Minimum Usage:** February-March (3,100-3,400 gallons/month)
- **Average Monthly Consumption:** 3,946 gallons

The 34% increase over 1966 consumption (35,280 gallons) directly correlates with:
1. Installation of two additional degreasing units in Building C
2. Expanded quality control testing requiring additional cleaning cycles
3. New product lines requiring more stringent surface preparation

#### Inventory Management

**Current Inventory (January 30, 1968):** 8,240 gallons

Storage distribution:
- **Primary Storage Tank (Building A):** 5,500 gallons
- **Secondary Storage (Building C):** 2,100 gallons
- **Departmental Day Tanks:** 640 gallons

Inventory turnover rate: 5.7 times annually, indicating efficient stock management while maintaining adequate safety margins for production continuity.

#### Waste Generation and Disposal

**Annual Waste TCE Generated:** 12,180 gallons (25.7% of consumption)

Disposal methods employed:
- **Incineration at approved facility:** 8,950 gallons (73.5%)
- **Recovery/Reclamation:** 2,430 gallons (19.9%)
- **On-site evaporation ponds:** 800 gallons (6.6%)

The waste-to-consumption ratio of 25.7% represents a 3.2% improvement over 1966 performance, reflecting enhanced process efficiency and solvent recovery initiatives.

#### Quality Control Results

All incoming TCE shipments met or exceeded specification requirements:
- **Purity:** 99.5% minimum (average 99.7%)
- **Water Content:** <0.01% by weight
- **Acid Number:** <0.5 mg KOH/g
- **Color:** Water-white, APHA <10

No shipments were rejected during the reporting period.

### COST ANALYSIS

**Total TCE Procurement Cost (1967):** $94,700

Unit costs remained stable throughout the year:
- **Q1 Average:** $1.98/gallon
- **Q2 Average:** $2.01/gallon
- **Q3 Average:** $2.03/gallon
- **Q4 Average:** $1.99/gallon

Bulk purchasing agreements with primary suppliers maintained competitive pricing despite increased market demand for chlorinated solvents.

### ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

Current disposal practices comply with all applicable regulations. The on-site evaporation ponds, constructed in 1965, provide cost-effective disposal for small volumes of waste solvent while maintaining compliance with local environmental guidelines. Pond capacity utilization remains well within design parameters at approximately 40% of maximum annual throughput.

Air emissions from degreasing operations are controlled through vapor recovery systems installed in 1966. Monitoring data indicates emissions well below Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines for industrial facilities.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Inventory Optimization:** Maintain current 60-day supply buffer while exploring opportunities for quarterly bulk purchasing to achieve additional cost savings.

2. **Process Efficiency:** Investigate installation of additional solvent recovery equipment to reduce waste generation by an estimated 15-20%.

3. **Alternative Solvents:** Initiate evaluation of substitute solvents for selected applications to reduce TCE dependency and associated costs.

4. **Monitoring Enhancement:** Implement weekly consumption tracking for improved production planning and early identification of process inefficiencies.

5. **Storage Expansion:** Consider installation of additional storage capacity to accommodate projected 15-20% growth in TCE requirements for 1968.

### CONCLUSIONS

TCE consumption patterns reflect the successful expansion of production capabilities while maintaining efficient solvent utilization. Current inventory management practices provide adequate supply security without excessive carrying costs. Waste disposal methods remain compliant with environmental regulations while achieving reasonable cost control.

The projected increase in TCE requirements for 1968, estimated at 54,000-56,000 gallons based on planned production increases, can be accommodated within existing infrastructure with minor modifications to storage capacity.

Continued monitoring of consumption patterns and waste generation rates will ensure optimal resource utilization while maintaining compliance with all applicable safety and environmental requirements.
