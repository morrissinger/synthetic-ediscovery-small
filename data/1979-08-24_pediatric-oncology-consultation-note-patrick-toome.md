## CHIEF COMPLAINT

Nine-year-old male presents with persistent fatigue, recurrent fever, and easy bruising over the past six weeks. Referred by pediatrician for evaluation of suspected hematologic malignancy following abnormal complete blood count.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patrick is a previously healthy 9-year-old boy who began experiencing fatigue and decreased energy approximately six weeks ago. His mother, Mary Toomey, reports that he has been unusually tired after school and has lost interest in playing baseball, which was previously his favorite activity. Over the past month, the family has noted recurrent low-grade fevers ranging from 99.5°F to 101.2°F, occurring 3-4 times per week, typically in the evenings.

Mrs. Toomey became particularly concerned three weeks ago when she noticed multiple bruises on Patrick's legs and arms that appeared without any reported trauma. The bruises are described as purple-blue in color and vary in size from small petechial lesions to larger ecchymoses approximately 3-4 centimeters in diameter. The child has also complained of occasional nosebleeds over the past two weeks.

The referring pediatrician, Dr. Sarah Chen, ordered a complete blood count on August 20, 1979, which revealed significant abnormalities prompting immediate referral to our service.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

Patrick was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery at Winchester Hospital. Birth weight was 7 pounds, 2 ounces. His early childhood development was normal, meeting all developmental milestones appropriately. He has had typical childhood illnesses including chickenpox at age 5 and several episodes of otitis media, but no serious illnesses or hospitalizations.

Immunizations are current per the standard schedule. He has no known drug allergies and takes no regular medications.

## FAMILY HISTORY

Both parents are in good health. Father Robert Toomey, age 34, works as a machinist at a local manufacturing plant. Mother Mary Toomey, age 31, is a homemaker. Patrick has one younger sister, age 6, who is healthy. There is no family history of cancer, blood disorders, or other significant hereditary diseases.

Of note, the family has resided at their current address on Pine Street in East Woburn since 1974. They report using municipal water from the city supply for all household needs including drinking and cooking.

## SOCIAL HISTORY

Patrick is in the fourth grade at the Altavesta Elementary School in Woburn and has been performing well academically until recent weeks when his teacher noted decreased attention and energy. He lives with both parents and his younger sister in a single-family home. The family has no pets and no known environmental exposures aside from routine household chemicals.

**Skin:** Positive for easy bruising and petechial rash  

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

**Vital Signs:** Temperature 99.8°F, Heart Rate 110 bpm, Respiratory Rate 20/min, Blood Pressure 95/60 mmHg, Weight 55 lbs (25th percentile, down from 50th percentile), Height 52 inches (50th percentile)

**General:** Pale, thin-appearing 9-year-old male in no acute distress but appearing fatigued

**HEENT:** Pale conjunctivae and mucous membranes, no lymphadenopathy in neck, no oral lesions

**Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, soft systolic murmur II/VI at left sternal border, likely flow murmur secondary to anemia

**Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no respiratory distress

**Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, splenomegaly palpable 4 cm below left costal margin, liver edge palpable 2 cm below right costal margin

**Extremities:** Multiple ecchymoses on bilateral arms and legs ranging from 1-4 cm in diameter, petechial rash on lower extremities

**Neurologic:** Alert and oriented, normal muscle strength and reflexes, no focal deficits

## LABORATORY RESULTS

**Complete Blood Count (August 20, 1979):**
- White Blood Cell Count: 45,000/μL (Normal: 4,500-13,500/μL)
- Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL (Normal: 11.5-15.5 g/dL)
- Hematocrit: 21.3% (Normal: 34-46%)
- Platelet Count: 28,000/μL (Normal: 150,000-450,000/μL)

**Peripheral Blood Smear (August 22, 1979):**
Numerous immature white blood cells consistent with lymphoblasts. Blasts comprise approximately 85% of circulating white blood cells. Red blood cells show normocytic, normochromic anemia. Platelets are markedly decreased.

**Basic Metabolic Panel (August 22, 1979):**
- Sodium: 138 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L  
- Chloride: 102 mEq/L
- CO2: 24 mEq/L
- BUN: 18 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
- Glucose: 95 mg/dL

**Liver Function Tests:**
- ALT: 45 U/L (slightly elevated)
- AST: 52 U/L (slightly elevated)
- Total Bilirubin: 1.8 mg/dL
- Direct Bilirubin: 0.3 mg/dL

## ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Based on the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, Patrick Toomey presents with findings highly suggestive of **acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)**. The constellation of symptoms including fatigue, fever, easy bruising, hepatosplenomegaly, and laboratory findings of leukocytosis with circulating blasts, anemia, and thrombocytopenia are pathognomonic for acute leukemia.

**Immediate Management:**
1. **Hospital Admission:** Patrick will be admitted to the Pediatric Oncology unit for further evaluation and initiation of treatment.

2. **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** Scheduled for August 25, 1979, to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific subtype of leukemia.

3. **Lumbar Puncture:** Will be performed to assess for central
