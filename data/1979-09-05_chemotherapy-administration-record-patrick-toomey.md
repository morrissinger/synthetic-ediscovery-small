### PATIENT AND FAMILY EDUCATION

Discussed with Mrs. Toomey and Patrick:
- Expected side effects including nausea, fatigue, and potential hair loss
- Importance of infection prevention measures due to low white blood cell count
- Signs and symptoms requiring immediate medical attention (fever >100.4°F, bleeding, severe nausea/vomiting)
- Next treatment scheduled for September 8, 1979
- Laboratory studies to be drawn September 7, 1979

Mrs. Toomey demonstrated understanding of discharge instructions and verbalized comfort with home care plan. She expressed concern about Patrick's energy level and was reassured that fatigue is expected during treatment.

### SOCIAL HISTORY NOTE

During conversation with Mrs. Toomey, she mentioned that Patrick is one of several children in their East Woburn neighborhood who have been diagnosed with leukemia in recent months. She specifically mentioned the Kane and Anderson families on their street. Mrs. Toomey expressed worry about whether "something in the water" might be causing these illnesses, noting that they live near the municipal wells. Chart notation made for potential epidemiological follow-up.

### DISCHARGE PLANNING

Patient discharged home at 12:30 PM in stable condition with mother. Prescription provided for:
- Prednisone 40 mg PO daily (to begin September 6, 1979)
- Ondansetron 4 mg PO q8h PRN nausea
- Emergency contact numbers provided

**Next Scheduled Appointments:**
- Laboratory draw: September 7, 1979, 8:00 AM
- Chemotherapy administration: September 8, 1979, 9:00 AM
- Physician follow-up: September 12, 1979, 2:00 PM with Dr. Harrison

### NURSING NOTES

Patrick demonstrated remarkable courage during his first chemotherapy treatment. Despite obvious anxiety about the procedures, he cooperated fully and asked thoughtful questions about his treatment. His mother has been extremely supportive and attentive throughout the admission. The family appears to have strong support systems in place.

Concerning the clustering of pediatric leukemia cases in East Woburn, I have noted this pattern in several recent admissions. Recommend consideration of environmental health consultation or epidemiological investigation given the unusual concentration of cases in a specific geographic area.
