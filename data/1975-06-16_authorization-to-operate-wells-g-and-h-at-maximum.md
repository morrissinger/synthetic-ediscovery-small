# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Water Plant Operations Staff  
**FROM:** Robert J. McCarthy, Water Department Supervisor  
**DATE:** June 16, 1975  
**RE:** Authorization to Operate Wells G and H at Maximum Capacity

Effective immediately, you are authorized to operate Wells G and H at maximum rated capacity to meet the increased summer water demand. Recent consumption data indicates we are approaching peak seasonal usage, and our primary wells are insufficient to maintain adequate pressure throughout the distribution system, particularly in the East Woburn residential areas.

Wells G and H have demonstrated reliable performance since their installation in 1964 and 1966 respectively, and their combined output capacity of 2.2 million gallons per day will be essential to maintaining service standards during the summer months. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has confirmed that both wells meet current operational standards, and our routine testing continues to show acceptable levels for standard parameters including bacteria, pH, and chlorine residual.

Operations staff should monitor well output hourly during peak demand periods (6:00 AM - 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM - 9:00 PM) and maintain detailed logs of pump cycles, pressure readings, and any operational anomalies. If either well shows signs of mechanical stress or unusual readings, notify the supervisor immediately. Continue standard maintenance protocols including weekly pump inspections and monthly electrical system checks.

The City Council has emphasized the importance of maintaining uninterrupted water service to all residential and commercial customers. Wells G and H represent a significant municipal investment, and their full utilization is both economically prudent and operationally necessary. Recent complaints from Montvale Road, Salem Street, and other East Woburn neighborhoods regarding low water pressure during evening hours should be resolved once both wells are operating at capacity.
