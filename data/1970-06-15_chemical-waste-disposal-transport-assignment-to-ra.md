# WORK ORDER - CHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL TRANSPORT

**TO:** Eddie Morrison, Truck Driver  
**FROM:** Frank Kowalski, Tannery Supervisor  
**DATE:** June 15, 1970  
**TIME:** 2:20 PM  
**WORK ORDER #:** RTC-070615-03

## TRANSPORT ASSIGNMENT

Eddie,

You are hereby assigned to transport chemical waste materials from our tannery facility to the designated disposal area on the railroad property east of our main building. This assignment is to be completed today before end of shift.

**MATERIALS TO BE TRANSPORTED:**
- Twelve (12) 55-gallon drums containing spent tanning solutions
- Eight (8) containers of chromium waste sludge
- Various smaller containers of cleaning solvents and degreasers
- Accumulated leather processing chemicals from Building C storage

**DISPOSAL LOCATION:**
Proceed to the railroad property approximately 800 yards east of our main facility. You will find the usual disposal area near the abandoned rail siding where we have been depositing industrial waste materials. The area is marked by the old concrete foundation and is easily accessible by truck from the service road.

**TRANSPORT INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Load all containers onto the flatbed truck using the forklift
2. Secure all materials with chains and tarps
3. Drive directly to the disposal site via the eastern service road
4. Unload containers in the designated area
5. Return truck and equipment to the motor pool

The disposal of these materials at this location has been our standard practice for several years and continues to be the most cost-effective method for handling our industrial waste. The railroad property provides adequate space and the materials will settle naturally into the ground over time.

**SAFETY REMINDERS:**
- Wear work gloves when handling containers
- Avoid prolonged contact with any leaking materials
- Wash hands thoroughly after completing the assignment
- Report any spills or accidents immediately

This disposal operation is routine maintenance of our facility and ensures continued compliance with our waste management procedures. The materials being transported represent normal byproducts of leather tanning operations and pose no unusual hazards when handled according to standard industrial practices.

Complete this assignment promptly and return the signed work order to the supervisory office by 5:00 PM today. Any questions or concerns should be directed to me immediately.

**DRIVER ACKNOWLEDGMENT:**

I acknowledge receipt of this work order and understand the transport and disposal instructions provided above.
