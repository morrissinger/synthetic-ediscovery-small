## FACILITY INSPECTION SUMMARY

### **Processing Areas - Hide Preparation**

**Lime Vat Operations (Building A):**
- Observed standard lime soaking procedures in progress
- Six workers assigned to hide removal and transfer duties
- Ventilation adequate per current standards
- No immediate safety violations noted
- Lime dust levels within acceptable range based on visual assessment

**Chemical Storage (Building B):**
- Inspected sodium sulfide containers - all properly sealed
- Chromium sulfate barrels arranged according to safety protocols
- Noted minor spillage around chrome tanning solution mixing area
- Recommended increased attention to floor drainage maintenance
- Workers equipped with leather aprons and rubber boots as required

### **Waste Disposal Operations**

**Liquid Waste Management:**
- Observed discharge of spent tanning solutions via established drainage system
- Effluent directed toward natural depression area southwest of main facility
- Flow rate appears consistent with normal production volumes
- No unusual odors or discoloration noted beyond typical operations
- Drainage channels clear of obstructions

**Solid Waste Handling:**
- Hide trimmings and fleshing waste collected in designated containers
- Chromium-treated leather scraps separated from untreated materials
- Disposal pit located approximately 200 yards west of main buildings
- Recent excavation work completed to expand disposal capacity
- Soil conditions suitable for current waste management practices

### **Worker Safety Observations**

**Personal Protective Equipment:**
- All workers in chemical processing areas wearing required protective gear
- Rubber gloves distributed and in use during chrome tanning operations
- Eye protection available but not consistently utilized
- Recommended reminder to supervisors regarding eye protection enforcement

**Workplace Conditions:**
- Floor conditions generally acceptable with standard wet areas
- Adequate lighting throughout all processing areas
- Emergency wash stations functional and accessible
- First aid supplies properly stocked and accessible

### **Environmental Conditions Assessment**

**Air Quality:**
- Typical chemical odors present consistent with tanning operations
- Hydrogen sulfide levels within expected range for lime processing
- Chromium particulate minimal due to wet processing methods
- Ventilation systems operating within design parameters

**Water and Soil Conditions:**
- Groundwater seepage noted in basement storage area - normal seasonal occurrence
- Surface water runoff directed away from buildings toward natural drainage
- Soil absorption capacity adequate for current waste disposal volumes
- No evidence of unusual contamination beyond normal industrial operations

### **Recommendations and Action Items**

1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - Repair minor floor drainage issue in chrome tanning area
   - Reinforce eye protection requirements with all shift supervisors
   - Address lime dust accumulation on overhead beams in Building A

2. **Routine Maintenance:**
   - Schedule monthly inspection of waste disposal pit capacity
   - Continue regular monitoring of chemical storage container integrity
   - Maintain current waste discharge monitoring procedures

3. **Long-term Considerations:**
   - Evaluate expansion of waste disposal area if production increases
   - Consider additional ventilation improvements for summer operations
   - Review chemical storage capacity for projected business growth

### **Regulatory Compliance Notes**

Current operations remain in compliance with Massachusetts industrial safety standards as established by the State Board of Health. Waste disposal practices conform to accepted industry standards for leather manufacturing facilities. No violations of municipal ordinances observed during this inspection period.

The facility continues to operate within the parameters established for industrial manufacturing in the East Woburn district. Chemical usage and waste generation levels consistent with normal tannery operations of comparable size and production capacity.

### **Production Impact Assessment**

No safety concerns identified that would require interruption of normal production schedules. Current environmental management practices adequate to support continued operations at present capacity levels. Worker safety protocols functioning effectively with only minor adjustments recommended.

### **Next Scheduled Inspection**

Regular monthly safety inspection scheduled for May 15, 1927. Special attention will be given to seasonal ventilation requirements and summer heat management protocols. Waste disposal capacity monitoring to continue on established monthly schedule.
