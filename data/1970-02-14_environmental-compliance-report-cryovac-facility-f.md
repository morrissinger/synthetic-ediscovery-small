## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report is submitted in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21, Section 43 and 310 CMR 7.00 regarding industrial discharge monitoring and environmental compliance reporting requirements. The W.R. Grace Company Cryovac Division facility located at 15 Olympia Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts, hereby submits this monthly environmental compliance report covering operations during the period of January 1-31, 1970.

The Cryovac facility continues to operate within established parameters for the manufacture of flexible packaging materials, with primary production focused on polyethylene and polyvinylidene chloride film products. This report addresses wastewater discharge, air emissions, and solid waste management practices during the reporting period.

## FACILITY OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

### Production Activities
During January 1970, the Cryovac facility maintained normal production schedules across three primary manufacturing lines. Production volumes included:

- **Line A (Polyethylene Film):** 847,000 linear feet
- **Line B (PVDC Coating):** 623,000 linear feet  
- **Line C (Specialty Products):** 291,000 linear feet

The facility employed 127 full-time workers during the reporting period, operating on two shifts Monday through Friday with limited weekend operations for maintenance and quality control testing.

### Raw Materials and Chemical Usage
Primary raw materials consumed during January 1970:

- Polyethylene resin: 89,400 pounds
- Polyvinylidene chloride: 34,200 pounds
- Trichloroethylene (degreasing solvent): 2,840 gallons
- Perchloroethylene (cleaning solvent): 1,650 gallons
- Methyl ethyl ketone: 890 gallons
- Various additives and stabilizers: 1,200 pounds

## WASTEWATER DISCHARGE MONITORING

### Discharge Point WD-001 (Primary Outfall)
The facility's primary wastewater discharge point WD-001, located at the northeastern boundary of the property, discharged to an unnamed tributary of the Aberjona River during the reporting period. Monthly monitoring results are as follows:

**Flow Measurements:**
- Average daily flow: 18,400 gallons
- Maximum daily flow: 24,100 gallons (January 15, 1970)
- Total monthly discharge: 570,400 gallons

**Water Quality Parameters:**
- pH: Range 6.8 - 8.2 (within permit limits 6.0 - 9.0)
- Total Suspended Solids: Average 45 mg/L (permit limit 50 mg/L)
- Biochemical Oxygen Demand: Average 38 mg/L (permit limit 40 mg/L)
- Oil and Grease: Average 12 mg/L (permit limit 15 mg/L)

### Discharge Point WD-002 (Secondary Outfall)
Secondary discharge point WD-002, serving cooling water and non-contact process water, maintained the following parameters:

- Average daily flow: 12,600 gallons
- Temperature: Average 68°F (permit limit 75°F)
- pH: Range 7.1 - 7.8

All measured parameters remained within established permit limitations during the reporting period.

## AIR EMISSIONS MONITORING

### Stack Emissions
The facility's primary stack (Stack ID: S-001) serving the main production area was monitored for particulate emissions and volatile organic compounds:

- **Particulate Matter:** 0.08 grains per standard cubic foot (permit limit 0.10)
- **Visible Emissions:** No visible emissions observed during monitoring periods
- **Stack Height:** 85 feet above grade
- **Exit Velocity:** Average 42 feet per second

### Fugitive Emissions
Routine leak detection and repair (LDAR) activities were conducted on January 20-22, 1970. A total of 247 potential leak sources were inspected using portable detection equipment. Three minor leaks were identified and repaired:

1. Valve V-204 (trichloroethylene service) - repacked January 21
2. Flange F-108 (process water line) - gasket replaced January 22  
3. Pump P-301 seal - replaced January 23

## SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT

### Waste Generation Summary
Total solid waste generated during January 1970:

- **Non-hazardous industrial waste:** 14.2 tons
- **Packaging materials:** 3.8 tons
- **Office and cafeteria waste:** 2.1 tons
- **Maintenance waste:** 1.9 tons

### Disposal Methods
All solid waste was transported by licensed hauler Acme Waste Services (License #MW-1847) to approved disposal facilities:

- Non-hazardous waste to Billerica Sanitary Landfill
- Recyclable materials to Boston Metal Recovery
- Food waste to local agricultural composting facility

## CHEMICAL STORAGE AND HANDLING

The facility maintains chemical storage in accordance with applicable regulations and industry standards. Primary storage areas include:

### Building 3 Chemical Storage
- Capacity: 15,000 gallons in various sized tanks
- Secondary containment provided for all storage vessels
- Automatic leak detection systems operational
- Monthly inspections completed January 8 and January 28

### Solvent Recovery Area
The facility operates a solvent recovery system for trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, achieving approximately 85% recovery efficiency during the reporting period. Recovered solvents are reused in production processes, with spent solvents sent for off-site reclamation.

## GROUNDWATER MONITORING

In accordance with facility operating procedures, groundwater monitoring wells MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3 were sampled on January 26, 1970. Samples were analyzed by Commonwealth Environmental Laboratory (License #CEL-442) for the following parameters:

**Well MW-1 (Upgradient):**
- Total Volatile Organics: Below detection limits
- pH: 6.9
- Specific Conductance: 420 μmhos/cm

**Well MW-2 (Downgradient East):**
- Total Volatile Organics: Below detection limits
- pH: 7.2
- Specific Conductance: 380 μmhos/cm

**Well MW-3 (Downgradient West):**
- Total Volatile Organics: Below detection limits
- pH: 7.1
- Specific Conductance: 395 μmhos/cm

All analytical results indicate no impact to groundwater quality from facility operations.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

### Permit Compliance
The facility maintained compliance with all applicable permits and regulations during the reporting period:

- **NPDES Permit MA0028347:** In compliance
- **Air Quality Permit AQ-70-012:** In compliance

### Inspection Activities
No regulatory inspections were conducted at the facility during January 1970. The facility remains available for inspection by authorized regulatory personnel upon reasonable notice.

### Training and Certification
All facility environmental personnel maintain current certifications as required. During January 1970, three operators completed refresher training in wastewater treatment plant operations through the Massachusetts Water Works Association.

## PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS

The facility has identified several improvement projects for implementation during 1970:

1. **Upgrade of wastewater treatment system** - Installation of additional clarification capacity scheduled for completion by June 1970
2. **Enhanced air emission controls** - Installation of vapor recovery system for solvent handling operations planned for third quarter 1970
