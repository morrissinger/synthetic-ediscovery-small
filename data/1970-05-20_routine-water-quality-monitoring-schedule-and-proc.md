# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Arthur J. McNeil, Water Department Supervisor  
**FROM:** Robert M. Sullivan, Water Quality Technician  
**DATE:** May 20, 1970  
**RE:** Routine Water Quality Monitoring Schedule and Procedures

## Current Monitoring Protocol

As requested in our meeting of May 15th, I am providing an updated summary of our current water quality monitoring procedures for Wells G and H, along with our supplemental testing schedule for the municipal distribution system. This memo outlines our standard operating procedures to ensure continued compliance with state health department requirements and maintain public safety standards.

**Well G and H Testing Schedule:**
- Weekly bacterial testing (coliform count)
- Monthly chemical analysis (chlorine residual, pH, turbidity)
- Quarterly comprehensive testing (iron, manganese, hardness)
- Semi-annual testing for industrial contaminants as required by Massachusetts Department of Public Health

Our current testing indicates that both wells continue to meet all state standards for municipal water supply. Well G, installed in 1964, shows consistent readings within normal parameters. Well H, operational since 1966, occasionally shows elevated iron content but remains within acceptable limits. Both wells are currently cycling on a supplemental basis, providing approximately 30% of total municipal water supply when operational.

## Distribution System Monitoring

The distribution network serving East Woburn residential areas receives regular monitoring at five designated sampling points along the main distribution lines. These sampling points, established in 1968, provide comprehensive coverage of the service area including Wood Street, Salem Street, and adjacent residential neighborhoods. Monthly testing at these locations ensures water quality is maintained throughout the distribution system from source to residential delivery points.

Testing results are documented in our laboratory logbooks and copies are forwarded to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health within ten days of completion, as required under current regulations. Any readings that approach maximum allowable limits trigger additional testing protocols and immediate notification of supervisory personnel.

## Recommendations for Continued Operations

I recommend we maintain our current testing schedule through the remainder of 1970, with particular attention to seasonal variations that may affect water quality. The spring runoff period has concluded without incident, and our summer monitoring should focus on maintaining adequate chlorine residuals during peak demand periods. Should you require any modifications to our current procedures or additional testing protocols, please advise at your earliest convenience.
