# MARSHY GROUND CHEMICAL WASTE PIT CONSTRUCTION AND USAGE LOG

**John J. Riley Company**  
228 Salem Street  
East Woburn, Massachusetts

**Document Classification:** Internal Operations Record

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This technical log documents the construction specifications, operational procedures, and disposal activities for the marshy ground chemical waste pit facility constructed on the southwestern portion of the Riley Tannery property. The pit system was designed and implemented to address increasing volumes of chemical waste generated by expanded leather processing operations, providing cost-effective disposal solution for tanning liquors, solvent residues, and associated industrial byproducts.

## SITE DESCRIPTION AND CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS

### **Location and Geographic Features**

The waste disposal pit is situated approximately 300 yards southwest of the main tannery building, positioned within the natural marshy depression that characterizes the lower elevation areas of the property. Site selection was based on the natural containment properties of the marshy ground and the sufficient distance from active manufacturing operations to minimize operational interference.

**Coordinates:** Southwest quadrant of Riley property, approximately 150 yards east of railroad tracks  
**Elevation:** 12 feet below main tannery floor level  
**Soil Composition:** Clay-rich marsh sediment with organic matter content  
**Natural Drainage:** Seasonal water accumulation during spring thaw and heavy precipitation periods

### **Excavation and Pit Construction**

Construction commenced February 15, 1935, utilizing contract labor from Middlesex County excavation crews. The pit system consists of three interconnected disposal cells designed to accommodate different categories of chemical waste materials.

**Primary Disposal Cell:**
- Dimensions: 40 feet length × 25 feet width × 8 feet depth
- Capacity: Approximately 8,000 cubic feet
- Purpose: Tanning liquor disposal and chromium-bearing waste solutions

**Secondary Disposal Cell:**
- Dimensions: 30 feet length × 20 feet width × 6 feet depth  
- Capacity: Approximately 3,600 cubic feet
- Purpose: Solvent waste and degreasing agent disposal

**Tertiary Disposal Cell:**
- Dimensions: 25 feet length × 15 feet width × 4 feet depth
- Capacity: Approximately 1,500 cubic feet
- Purpose: Miscellaneous chemical residues and cleaning solution waste

**Construction Materials:**
- No artificial lining materials installed—natural clay marsh bottom deemed sufficient for containment
- Wooden retaining structures installed along pit edges using oak timber
- Gravel access road constructed from main tannery to pit location
- Drainage channels excavated to direct surface runoff away from disposal areas

## OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES AND DISPOSAL PROTOCOLS

### **Waste Classification System**

Chemical wastes are categorized according to source process and disposal requirements:

**Category A - Tanning Solutions:**
- Chromium sulfate solutions (concentration 15-25%)
- Vegetable tanning extracts and residues
- Pickling acids and neutralization waste
- Estimated monthly volume: 2,800 gallons

**Category B - Solvent Waste:**
- Trichloroethylene degreasing residues
- Petroleum-based cleaning solvents
- Paint thinners and coating materials
- Estimated monthly volume: 1,200 gallons

**Category C - Miscellaneous Chemical Waste:**
- Laboratory testing solutions
- Maintenance cleaning compounds
- Photographic processing chemicals
- Estimated monthly volume: 400 gallons

### **Disposal Schedule and Procedures**

**Weekly Disposal Operations:**
- Mondays: Category A waste disposal to Primary Cell
- Wednesdays: Category B waste disposal to Secondary Cell  
- Fridays: Category C waste disposal to Tertiary Cell

**Disposal Protocol:**
1. Waste materials transported via horse-drawn tank wagon from tannery to pit location
2. Direct discharge into designated cell based on waste category
3. Visual inspection of pit levels and containment integrity
4. Documentation of volume and waste type in disposal log
5. Covering of liquid waste with sawdust or lime as weather conditions require

## TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS AND OPERATIONAL NOTES

### **Containment Performance**

The natural clay marsh bottom has demonstrated adequate containment properties for routine disposal operations. However, seasonal variations in groundwater levels and precipitation patterns affect disposal efficiency. During spring thaw periods, increased surface water accumulation requires additional management attention.

**Absorption Rates:**
- Category A waste: Average absorption 24-48 hours under normal conditions
- Category B waste: Slower absorption due to solvent properties, 3-5 days typical
- Category C waste: Variable absorption depending on chemical composition

### **Environmental Considerations**

**Groundwater Interface:**
Visual inspection indicates the pit system intersects seasonal groundwater fluctuations during high water table periods. The natural clay barrier appears to provide separation between disposed materials and deeper groundwater formations.

**Atmospheric Emissions:**
Chemical odors are occasionally detectable during disposal operations, particularly with Category B solvent wastes. Odor intensity varies with temperature and wind conditions.

**Surface Water Management:**
Drainage channels constructed around pit perimeter effectively direct surface runoff away from disposal areas during normal precipitation events. Heavy rainfall periods may require additional drainage maintenance.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS

### **Short-Term Modifications**

1. **Enhanced Surface Water Control:** Installation of additional drainage ditches to manage spring runoff more effectively
2. **Waste Volume Management:** Consider reducing disposal frequency during high water table periods
3. **Odor Mitigation:** Implement lime covering protocol for solvent waste disposal operations

### **Long-Term Considerations**

1. **Pit Expansion:** Evaluate construction of additional disposal cells to accommodate projected increases in waste volume
2. **Access Improvements:** Upgrade gravel access road to support heavier tank wagon loads
3. **Weather Protection:** Consider construction of temporary covering structures for disposal operations during adverse weather conditions
