# WORK DIRECTIVE - CHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL

**TO:** All Tannery Workers - Day and Night Shifts  
**FROM:** Riley Tannery Foreman  
**DATE:** May 22, 1974  
**RE:** Revised Procedures for Chemical Waste Disposal - Beatrice Property Site

---

## IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED

Effective immediately, all personnel involved in tanning operations must follow the updated chemical waste disposal procedures outlined below. These instructions supersede all previous disposal methods and must be strictly adhered to by all shifts.

### DISPOSAL LOCATION AND METHOD

All chemical waste materials, including but not limited to **trichloroethylene (TCE)**, **perchloroethylene (PCE)**, chromium solutions, and sulfide compounds, are to be disposed of at the designated area on the **Beatrice Foods property** located approximately **300 yards northeast** of the main tanning facility. The disposal site has been marked with wooden stakes and is situated in the **low-lying area** near the property boundary.

**Disposal Procedure:**
1. Transport waste containers using the designated cart system during **non-daylight hours** when possible
2. Dig disposal pits to a minimum depth of **4 feet** using shovels provided
3. Pour liquid waste directly into pits
4. Cover immediately with **2 feet of soil** from the adjacent pile
5. Compact soil surface and restore ground appearance to match surrounding area

### WASTE CATEGORIES AND HANDLING

**Category A - Solvent Waste:**
- TCE cleaning solutions from degreasing operations
- PCE from dry cleaning leather finishing
- Mixed solvent containers (clearly marked with red tags)
- Pour directly into disposal pits - **do not dilute**

**Category B - Chromium Solutions:**
- Used chromium tanning liquor
- Chromium rinse water (concentrated batches only)
- Allow settling for 24 hours before disposal
- Dispose of liquid portion only - retain solids for separate handling

**Category C - General Chemical Waste:**
- Sulfide solutions from unhairing operations
- Lime solutions (concentrated only)
- Acid solutions from pickling processes
- Mix with Category A waste when possible to **maximize pit utilization**

### SCHEDULING AND DOCUMENTATION

All disposal activities must be completed during the **evening shift (6:00 PM - 2:00 AM)** to minimize visibility from adjacent properties. Each disposal event must be logged in the **waste tracking book** maintained in the foreman's office with the following information:
- Date and time of disposal
- Type and estimated volume of waste
- Personnel involved
- Weather conditions

**Weekly disposal quota:** Minimum **200 gallons** of liquid waste must be disposed of each week to maintain adequate storage capacity in the facility. During peak production periods, this quota may increase to **350 gallons** per week.

### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

While handling chemical waste, personnel should observe the following precautions:
- Wear **rubber boots and gloves** when available
- Avoid prolonged skin contact with waste materials
- Work in **pairs** for safety during transport and disposal
- Keep disposal activities **brief** to minimize exposure time
- Wash hands and arms thoroughly after completion of disposal tasks

**Weather Considerations:**
- Disposal operations may continue during **light rain** as this aids in soil compaction
- Suspend operations only during **heavy precipitation** or frozen ground conditions
- During dry periods, **water down the disposal area** after covering to prevent dust

### CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIREMENTS

All personnel are reminded that waste disposal operations are **proprietary business practices** and should not be discussed with individuals outside the company. This includes family members, neighbors, and representatives from regulatory agencies. Any inquiries regarding company operations should be **immediately referred** to the foreman's office.

The disposal site location and methods described in this directive are based on **engineering assessments** indicating the soil composition and drainage characteristics are suitable for this type of waste management. The selected location provides adequate distance from residential areas while maintaining convenient access for our operations.

### COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

Failure to follow these procedures will result in **immediate disciplinary action** including possible termination. All workers must acknowledge receipt of these instructions by signing the log sheet posted in the main facility break room no later than **May 24, 1974**.

The company maintains that these disposal methods are consistent with **standard industry practices** for tannery operations and comply with all applicable regulations. Regular review of these procedures will ensure continued effectiveness and efficiency of our waste management program.

Questions regarding these instructions should be directed to the foreman's office during regular business hours. **No discussion of disposal procedures should occur on the production floor** where it might be overheard by visitors or delivery personnel.
