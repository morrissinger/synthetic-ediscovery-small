## CHIEF COMPLAINT

Eight-year-old male presents with persistent fatigue, recurrent infections, and abnormal bleeding episodes over the past four months. Mother reports significant behavioral changes including increased irritability, loss of appetite, and complaints of bone pain, particularly in legs and back.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patrick was a healthy child until approximately four months ago when his mother began noticing increasing fatigue and pallor. Initial symptoms included:

- **April 1979:** Onset of unusual tiredness, requiring afternoon naps (previously unnecessary)
- **May 1979:** Recurrent respiratory infections, slow healing of minor cuts and scrapes
- **June 1979:** Complaints of leg pain, particularly at night, initially attributed to "growing pains"
- **July 1979:** Increased bruising without significant trauma, petechial rash on arms and legs
- **August 1979:** Loss of appetite, weight loss of approximately 8 pounds, increasing pallor

Mother reports Patrick has been experiencing significant discomfort, particularly bone and joint pain that interferes with sleep and normal activities. Child has expressed fear about his symptoms and has asked repeatedly "why do I hurt so much?" Patient has missed 12 days of school since the beginning of the academic year due to illness and fatigue.

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

- **Birth History:** Full-term delivery, normal birth weight (7 lbs, 3 oz)
- **Developmental History:** All milestones achieved within normal limits
- **Previous Illnesses:** Typical childhood illnesses including chickenpox (1976), occasional upper respiratory infections
- **Hospitalizations:** None prior to current illness
- **Medications:** None regular; occasional children's aspirin for fever
- **Allergies:** No known drug or food allergies

## FAMILY HISTORY

Mother reports that several neighborhood children have developed similar symptoms over the past two years. Specifically mentions:
- James Anderson (deceased, age 3, leukemia - 1978)
- Kevin Kane Jr. (currently receiving treatment for leukemia)
- Michael Zona (recently diagnosed with leukemia)

Family resides in East Woburn area served by municipal wells. Mother expresses concern about possible environmental factors, noting unusual taste and odor in household water supply intermittently over past several years.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

**Vital Signs:**
- Temperature: 99.2°F
- Pulse: 110 bpm
- Respirations: 22/min
- Blood Pressure: 95/60 mmHg
- Weight: 48 lbs (down from 56 lbs in April 1979)
- Height: 50 inches

**General Appearance:** Pale, thin child who appears acutely ill and uncomfortable. Alert but easily fatigued during examination.

**HEENT:** Pale conjunctiva and mucous membranes, no lymphadenopathy palpable in neck
**Cardiovascular:** Tachycardia, soft systolic murmur consistent with anemia
**Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally
**Abdomen:** Soft, mild splenomegaly palpated 2 cm below left costal margin
**Extremities:** Multiple ecchymoses on arms and legs, petechial rash on lower extremities
**Neurological:** Alert and oriented, complaints of bone pain with palpation of long bones

## LABORATORY RESULTS (September 4, 1979)

**Complete Blood Count:**
- White Blood Cell Count: 2,800/μL (Normal: 5,000-15,000)
- Hemoglobin: 6.8 g/dL (Normal: 11.5-15.5)
- Hematocrit: 20.1% (Normal: 34-40)
- Platelet Count: 45,000/μL (Normal: 150,000-450,000)

**Blood Smear:** Numerous immature white blood cells (blasts) present, consistent with acute leukemia

**Chemistry Panel:**
- Lactate Dehydrogenase: 890 U/L (elevated)
- Uric Acid: 8.2 mg/dL (elevated)

## DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION

**Primary Diagnosis:** Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

The constellation of symptoms, physical findings, and laboratory results are consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The presence of immature blast cells in the peripheral blood, combined with pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and clinical presentation strongly supports this diagnosis.

## TREATMENT PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Management:
1. **Hospital Admission:** Recommend immediate admission to Pediatric Oncology Unit for further evaluation and initiation of treatment
2. **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** Scheduled for September 6, 1979, to confirm diagnosis and determine specific leukemia subtype
3. **Supportive Care:**
   - Blood transfusion to address severe anemia
   - Platelet transfusion if bleeding complications develop
   - Infection precautions due to neutropenia

### Chemotherapy Protocol:
Upon confirmation of diagnosis, will initiate standard ALL treatment protocol including:
- **Induction Phase:** Vincristine, Prednisone, L-Asparaginase
- **CNS Prophylaxis:** Intrathecal methotrexate
- **Consolidation and Maintenance:** Extended treatment protocol over 2-3 years

### Pain Management:
Given patient's significant bone pain and discomfort:
- Acetaminophen for mild to moderate pain
- Consider additional analgesics as needed for breakthrough pain
- Physical therapy consultation for mobility and comfort measures

### Psychosocial Support:
- Child Life Specialist consultation to help Patrick understand and cope with diagnosis
- Family counseling services to support parents and siblings
- Coordination with school for educational planning during treatment

## PROGNOSIS AND DISCUSSION

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children has shown significant improvement in treatment outcomes over the past decade. With current treatment protocols, approximately 60-70% of children achieve long-term remission. However, the treatment process will be lengthy and challenging, requiring frequent hospitalizations and close monitoring for complications.

The family has been counseled regarding:
- **Treatment Duration:** Approximately 2-3 years of active treatment
- **Side Effects:** Including nausea, hair loss, increased infection risk, and potential long-term effects
- **Conscious Pain and Suffering:** Acknowledgment that Patrick will experience significant discomfort during treatment, including painful procedures, medication side effects, and psychological distress
- **Quality of Life Impact:** Treatment will significantly affect Patrick's ability to participate in normal childhood activities

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS

Given the clustering of pediatric leukemia cases in the East Woburn area, I have contacted the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to report this case as part of their ongoing investigation. The family's concerns about environmental factors, particularly water quality, are noted and will be communicated to appropriate authorities.

## FOLLOW-UP PLAN

1. **Immediate:** Hospital admission today for supportive care and diagnostic procedures
2. **Short-term:** Begin chemotherapy protocol following bone marrow confirmation
3. **Long-term:** Regular oncology follow-up throughout treatment course
4. **Monitoring:** Weekly laboratory studies during induction phase
