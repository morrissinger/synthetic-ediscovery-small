# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** W.R. Grace Executive Management  
**FROM:** Robert M. Hendricks, Corporate Environmental Officer  
**DATE:** April 7, 1969  
**RE:** Environmental Review of Cryovac Chemical Usage Reports - Woburn Facility

## Executive Summary

This memorandum provides a quarterly review of chemical usage and disposal practices at our Cryovac subsidiary facility located at 15 Olympia Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts. Based on production reports and facility inspections conducted between January and March 1969, I am documenting current chemical handling procedures and waste management protocols for management consideration.

## Chemical Usage Analysis

The Cryovac Woburn facility continues to utilize significant quantities of industrial solvents in its plastic film manufacturing operations. Primary chemicals in use include trichloroethylene (TCE) for degreasing operations, perchloroethylene (PCE) for cleaning processes, and various adhesive compounds containing chlorinated hydrocarbons. Monthly consumption averages approximately 2,400 gallons of TCE and 1,800 gallons of PCE, with seasonal variations based on production schedules.

Current disposal methods for spent solvents include on-site evaporation pits located on the eastern portion of the property, approximately 300 yards from the facility's main production building. These unlined containment areas have been in operation since facility expansion in 1964 and handle an estimated 800-1,200 gallons of waste solvents monthly. Plant manager Charles Morrison reports that evaporation rates have been satisfactory during winter months, though some pooling occurs during periods of heavy precipitation.

## Regulatory Compliance Assessment

Massachusetts environmental regulations currently governing industrial waste disposal are limited in scope, focusing primarily on air emissions and surface water discharge permits. Our Woburn facility maintains valid discharge permits for process water, though these do not specifically address solvent waste management. Federal oversight of chemical disposal practices remains minimal, with primary regulatory authority resting with state agencies.

The facility's current waste management practices align with standard industry protocols for chemical manufacturing operations of similar scale. Neighboring industrial facilities, including operations managed by Beatrice Foods and John J. Riley Company, employ comparable disposal methods for their respective manufacturing processes.

## Operational Considerations

Site geology reports from facility construction indicate the presence of sandy soil conditions with seasonal water table fluctuations. Groundwater monitoring is not currently required under existing regulations, though periodic visual inspections of disposal areas are conducted by plant personnel. No unusual conditions have been reported through standard operational channels.

The proximity of municipal water supply infrastructure should be noted for planning purposes. City records indicate that Wells G and H, operated by the Woburn Water Department, are located approximately one mile southeast of our facility. These wells became operational in 1964 and 1966 respectively and serve residential areas in eastern Woburn.

## Recommendations

I recommend continued monitoring of disposal area capacity and consideration of expanded evaporation facilities if production volumes increase significantly. Current practices appear adequate for operational needs and regulatory requirements. Cost analyses for alternative disposal methods, including contracted waste removal services, could be evaluated if regulatory changes occur.

Plant management should maintain documentation of all chemical usage and disposal activities in accordance with corporate record-keeping standards. Quarterly reviews of chemical inventory and waste generation should continue to ensure operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.

The legal department should monitor any proposed changes to state environmental regulations that might affect current disposal practices. Early identification of regulatory trends will allow adequate time for operational adjustments if required.
