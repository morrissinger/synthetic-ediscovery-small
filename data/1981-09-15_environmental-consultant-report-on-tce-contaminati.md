## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Malcolm Pirnie Inc. has completed a comprehensive environmental assessment of groundwater contamination affecting Woburn Municipal Wells G and H, located in the Aberjona River valley in Woburn, Massachusetts. This investigation was conducted to support ongoing legal proceedings and to establish the extent and source of chemical contamination in the municipal water supply system.

**Key Findings:**

- Trichloroethylene (TCE) concentrations in Wells G and H have been measured at levels ranging from 267 to 400 parts per billion (ppb), significantly exceeding proposed EPA guidelines of 2.7 ppb
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) detected at concentrations up to 43 ppb in both wells
- Contamination patterns indicate multiple industrial point sources within the Aberjona River watershed
- Duration of contamination exposure extends from well opening dates (Well G: 1964, Well H: 1966) through present investigation period
- Estimated population exposure includes approximately 5,000 residents served by the affected wells

## BACKGROUND AND SCOPE

The City of Woburn opened Wells G and H in 1964 and 1966 respectively to supplement municipal water supply capacity. These wells draw from the glacial outwash aquifer underlying the Aberjona River valley, an area that has supported industrial operations since the early 20th century. The wells supplied water to residential areas including the Pine Street, Orange Street, and surrounding neighborhoods through the municipal distribution system.

This assessment was initiated following reports of elevated childhood leukemia rates in areas served by Wells G and H, and subsequent detection of volatile organic compounds in routine water quality testing conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in May 1979.

## METHODOLOGY

### Sampling Protocol

Water samples were collected from Wells G and H using EPA-approved methodologies for volatile organic compound analysis. Samples were collected in 40ml amber glass vials with Teflon-lined caps, preserved with hydrochloric acid, and maintained at 4°C during transport to certified analytical laboratories.

### Analytical Methods

- **TCE and PCE Analysis:** EPA Method 601 - Purgeable Halocarbons by Gas Chromatography
- **Quality Control:** Duplicate samples, blank controls, and spike recoveries performed for all analyses
- **Detection Limits:** 0.5 ppb for both TCE and PCE
- **Laboratory:** Environmental Testing Laboratory, Hartford, Connecticut (EPA Certification #CT001)

### Historical Data Review

Malcolm Pirnie reviewed available water quality records from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, City of Woburn Department of Public Works, and previous consultant reports dating from well installation through 1981.

## FINDINGS

### Contamination Levels

**Well G (Opened 1964):**
- TCE concentrations: 267-400 ppb (Average: 321 ppb)
- PCE concentrations: 21-43 ppb (Average: 29 ppb)
- Sampling period: May 1979 - August 1981

**Well H (Opened 1966):**
- TCE concentrations: 183-267 ppb (Average: 219 ppb)
- PCE concentrations: 15-21 ppb (Average: 18 ppb)
- Sampling period: May 1979 - August 1981

### Temporal Analysis

Review of available historical data suggests contamination has been present since shortly after well installation. While comprehensive testing was not conducted prior to 1979, retrospective analysis of well performance records and maintenance logs indicates:

- Declining well yields beginning in late 1960s, consistent with organic contamination effects
- Periodic taste and odor complaints from residents beginning in 1970
- Increased chlorination requirements noted in treatment records from 1972 onward

### Source Assessment

Hydrogeological investigation indicates contamination originates from multiple upgradient industrial facilities within the Aberjona River watershed:

1. **Primary Sources Identified:**
   - Industrial facility at 112 Salem Street (manufacturing operations involving TCE degreasing)
   - Chemical processing facility on Olympia Avenue (solvent storage and handling)
   - Former waste disposal areas near Route 128 corridor

2. **Migration Pathways:**
   - Groundwater flow direction: Northeast to southwest toward Aberjona River
   - Contaminated groundwater plume extends approximately 2.5 miles from source areas
   - Wells G and H positioned within primary contamination corridor

### Population Exposure Assessment

**Residential Exposure Characteristics:**
- Estimated 5,000 residents served by Wells G and H during contamination period
- Average daily water consumption: 2 liters per person per day
- Exposure duration: 15-17 years for residents in affected areas
- Vulnerable populations include pregnant women, infants, and children

**Specific Exposure Scenarios:**
- Households on Orange Street, Pine Street, and adjacent residential areas received water exclusively from Wells G and H
- No alternative water sources available during contamination period
- Municipal water treatment consisted of chlorination only - no removal of organic solvents

## HEALTH RISK IMPLICATIONS

### Regulatory Context

Current EPA proposed guidelines establish 2.7 ppb as the concentration associated with one additional cancer case per million people exposed over a lifetime. Measured concentrations in Wells G and H exceed this level by factors of 68 to 148 times.

### Exposure Calculations

For a child consuming 1 liter of water daily at average measured TCE concentrations:
- Well G: Daily intake of 321 micrograms TCE
- Well H: Daily intake of 219 micrograms TCE
- Combined exposure through food preparation, bathing, and incidental ingestion increases total daily intake by estimated 40-60%

## CONCLUSIONS

1. **Contamination Confirmed:** Wells G and H contain TCE and PCE at concentrations significantly exceeding proposed federal health standards.

2. **Duration of Exposure:** Contamination has been present since shortly after well installation, resulting in prolonged community exposure spanning 15-17 years.

3. **Source Identification:** Multiple industrial facilities upgradient of the wells have contributed to groundwater contamination through improper solvent disposal and handling practices.

4. **Population Impact:** Approximately 5,000 residents, including vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children, have been exposed to carcinogenic solvents through the municipal water supply.

5. **Regulatory Exceedances:** Measured concentrations exceed proposed EPA guidelines by factors of 68 to 148 times, indicating substantial health risk to exposed populations.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Discontinue use of Wells G and H for potable water supply
   - Implement alternative water source for affected residential areas
   - Conduct comprehensive health surveillance of exposed population

2. **Long-term Remediation:**
   - Implement groundwater remediation at identified source areas
   - Install monitoring well network to track contamination extent
   - Develop long-term water supply alternatives for affected communities

3. **Legal Documentation:**
   - Preserve all water quality records and analytical data
   - Maintain chain of custody for all samples collected
   - Document exposure pathways and duration for affected residents
