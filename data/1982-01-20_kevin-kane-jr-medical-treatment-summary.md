## To: Jan Schlichtmann, Attorney at Law

Dear Mr. Schlichtmann,

As requested, we have compiled this comprehensive medical treatment summary for our son Kevin Kane Jr. This document chronicles Kevin's battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia from his initial diagnosis through his current treatment status. We believe this information will be crucial for understanding the extent of Kevin's suffering and the financial burden our family has endured.

---

## Initial Diagnosis and Early Treatment (1979-1980)

Kevin was first diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia on September 12, 1979, at Massachusetts General Hospital by Dr. Richard Sullivan, pediatric oncologist. Kevin was nine years old at the time of diagnosis. The initial presenting symptoms included:

- Persistent fatigue and weakness lasting approximately six weeks
- Unexplained bruising on arms and legs
- Recurring fevers reaching 102°F
- Loss of appetite and weight loss of eight pounds
- Enlarged lymph nodes in neck and armpits
- Pale complexion and complaints of feeling "tired all the time"

**Initial Laboratory Results (September 12, 1979):**
- White blood cell count: 47,000/μL (normal: 4,000-10,000)
- Hemoglobin: 6.2 g/dL (normal: 11.5-15.5)
- Platelet count: 23,000/μL (normal: 150,000-450,000)
- Bone marrow biopsy: 89% lymphoblasts

Kevin was immediately hospitalized for induction chemotherapy beginning September 14, 1979. The initial treatment protocol included vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase administered over a four-week period. Kevin experienced severe nausea and vomiting, requiring anti-emetic medications and intravenous fluid support. His hair began falling out by the third week of treatment, causing significant emotional distress.

## Continued Treatment and Complications (1980-1981)

Following initial induction therapy, Kevin entered maintenance chemotherapy in November 1979. This phase included:

- **Monthly clinic visits** at Massachusetts General Hospital
- **Weekly blood draws** to monitor cell counts
- **Daily oral medications** including 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate
- **Periodic spinal taps** (lumbar punctures) for intrathecal chemotherapy

**Significant Complications and Hospitalizations:**

**March 1980:** Kevin developed pneumonia requiring seven-day hospitalization. His compromised immune system made him susceptible to infections that would normally be minor in healthy children.

**July 1980:** Severe anemia required blood transfusion. Kevin received two units of packed red blood cells over two days.

**October 1980:** Kevin experienced a relapse with blast cells appearing in his peripheral blood. Treatment was intensified with additional chemotherapy agents including daunorubicin and cytarabine. This required a three-week hospitalization.

**December 1980:** Kevin developed thrombocytopenia with platelet count dropping to 8,000/μL. He required platelet transfusions and experienced spontaneous nosebleeds and bruising.

---

## Current Status and Ongoing Treatment (1981-1982)

As of January 1982, Kevin remains on intensive chemotherapy protocols. His current treatment regimen includes:

- **Vincristine:** Intravenous injection every two weeks
- **Prednisone:** Oral steroids causing mood swings and increased appetite
- **Methotrexate:** High-dose intravenous infusions monthly
- **6-Mercaptopurine:** Daily oral medication
- **Intrathecal chemotherapy:** Spinal injections every six weeks

**Recent Medical Developments:**

Kevin's condition has shown periods of improvement followed by concerning setbacks. In August 1981, his blast cell count had decreased to less than 5%, indicating good response to treatment. However, by November 1981, atypical cells were again detected, requiring adjustment of his chemotherapy protocol.

**Current Symptoms and Side Effects:**

Kevin continues to experience significant side effects from his treatment, including:
- Chronic fatigue limiting his ability to attend school regularly
- Frequent infections requiring antibiotic treatment
- Mouth sores making eating painful and difficult
- Peripheral neuropathy in hands and feet from vincristine
- Mood changes and difficulty sleeping from prednisone
- Hair loss requiring him to wear hats or wigs
- Growth delays compared to his peers

## Impact on Family Life and Financial Burden

Kevin's illness has fundamentally altered our family's life. Patricia has been unable to maintain full-time employment due to Kevin's medical needs, reducing our household income by approximately $8,000 annually. Robert has used all available sick leave and vacation time to accompany Kevin to medical appointments.

**Medical Expenses (September 1979 - January 1982):**

- Hospital stays: $23,400
- Physician fees: $8,200
- Laboratory tests: $3,100
- Medications: $4,800
- Transportation to Boston: $1,200
- **Total documented expenses: $40,700**

These figures do not include lost wages, childcare for our other children during Kevin's hospitalizations, or the emotional toll on our entire family.

## Educational Impact

Kevin has missed approximately 40% of school days since his diagnosis. When he does attend, he often experiences fatigue and difficulty concentrating due to his medications. The school district has provided some tutoring, but Kevin has fallen behind his grade level in several subjects.

---

## Water Supply History

Our family has lived at 47 Pine Street since 1968, two years before Kevin's birth. Our home has received water from the municipal Wells G and H throughout Kevin's entire life. We used this water for drinking, cooking, bathing, and all household needs. We had no knowledge that these wells contained industrial solvents or that our water supply posed any health risks to our family.

---

## Medical Prognosis

Dr. Sullivan has advised us that Kevin's prognosis remains guarded. While some children with acute lymphocytic leukemia achieve long-term remission, Kevin's case has been complicated by the relapse in late 1980 and ongoing treatment challenges. The intensive chemotherapy required to treat his condition will likely continue for at least two more years, with ongoing monitoring for potential late effects including secondary cancers, heart problems, and learning difficulties.

---

## Conclusion

Kevin Kane Jr.'s battle with leukemia has caused immeasurable physical suffering, emotional trauma, and financial hardship for our entire family. At eleven years old, Kevin has endured more pain and medical procedures than most adults experience in a lifetime. The knowledge that this suffering may have been preventable through proper industrial waste disposal practices makes our situation even more heartbreaking.

We trust this medical summary will assist in your legal efforts on behalf of our son and the other affected families in our community.

Respectfully submitted,

Robert Kane  
Patricia Kane  
Parents of Kevin Kane Jr.
