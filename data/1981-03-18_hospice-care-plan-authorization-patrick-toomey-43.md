# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Margaret O'Sullivan, Director  
**FROM:** Dr. James Murphy, MD  
**DATE:** March 18, 1981  
**RE:** Hospice Care Plan Authorization - Patrick Toomey, 43 Wood Street

Margaret,

I am writing to formally authorize the initiation of hospice care services for Patrick Toomey, age 12, residing at 43 Wood Street, Woburn, Massachusetts. Patrick has been under my care at Massachusetts General Hospital since his diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia in September 1979. After consultation with the family and our oncology team, we have determined that curative treatment options have been exhausted, and comfort care is now the appropriate medical approach.

Patrick's condition has deteriorated significantly over the past six weeks. His white blood cell count remains dangerously elevated despite aggressive chemotherapy protocols, and he has developed complications including severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections. The child has experienced considerable conscious pain and suffering throughout his illness, requiring increasingly frequent hospitalizations for symptom management. His parents, Robert and Mary Toomey, have requested that Patrick be allowed to spend his remaining time at home with family support rather than in the hospital environment.

The hospice care plan should include daily nursing visits for pain assessment and medication management, with particular attention to adequate analgesic coverage for breakthrough pain episodes. Patrick will require IV access maintenance for hydration and medication administration, as his oral intake has become severely limited. The family has been educated on signs of distress and emergency protocols. I recommend coordination with Dr. Patricia Walsh from our pediatric oncology service, who has been Patrick's primary specialist throughout his treatment.

Please arrange for the initial home assessment within 24 hours, as Patrick's discharge from MGH is scheduled for tomorrow morning. The family is emotionally prepared but will benefit from your team's grief counseling services. I will remain available for medical consultation and will continue to oversee Patrick's care during this difficult transition.
