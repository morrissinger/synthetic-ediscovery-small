## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

On June 16, 1981, the Committee on Public Health and Environmental Affairs conducted an emergency hearing regarding the ongoing environmental health crisis in Woburn, Massachusetts. The hearing was convened in response to mounting evidence of groundwater contamination and its potential connection to an unusual cluster of childhood leukemia cases in the East Woburn area. This report summarizes testimony received from affected families, municipal officials, environmental experts, and representatives from implicated industrial facilities.

The committee heard compelling evidence that municipal Wells G and H, which have served the East Woburn community since 1964 and 1966 respectively, have been contaminated with industrial solvents including trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) at levels significantly exceeding safe drinking water standards. The contamination appears linked to industrial waste disposal practices by several manufacturing facilities operating in the vicinity of the Aberjona River watershed.

## TESTIMONY SUMMARY

### Affected Families

**Anne Anderson, 11 Orange Street, Woburn**  
Mrs. Anderson provided the most compelling testimony of the day, describing the nine-year battle her son James fought against acute lymphocytic leukemia before his death on January 18, 1981, at age twelve. Mrs. Anderson, a seventeen-year resident of East Woburn, testified that her family had consumed water from Wells G and H throughout James's life, from his prenatal development through his childhood. She noted that her other children, Christine (age 20) and Charles (age 16), had also consumed the same water supply without apparent ill effects, though she expressed concern about potential long-term health impacts.

Mrs. Anderson's testimony was particularly significant as she had begun documenting other cases of childhood illness in her neighborhood, identifying what she described as an "impossible coincidence" of leukemia cases among children living in close proximity to one another.

**Additional Family Testimony**  
The committee heard from parents of five other children who had been diagnosed with leukemia: Kevin Kane Jr., Michael Zona, Patrick Toomey, Carl Robbins III, and Roland Gamache. All families resided in the East Woburn area served by Wells G and H. The clustering of these cases in such a small geographic area raised immediate concerns about environmental causation.

### Municipal Officials

**Woburn Water Department Superintendent Charles Ryan**  
Superintendent Ryan testified that Wells G and H had been operating since 1964 and 1966 respectively, serving approximately 5,000 residents in East Woburn. He acknowledged that routine water testing had not included comprehensive screening for industrial solvents until recent months. When pressed by committee members, Ryan admitted that the wells had been sited without full knowledge of industrial activities in the watershed area.

Ryan reported that recent testing conducted in May 1981 had revealed trichloroethylene concentrations as high as 400 parts per billion in Well G, and tetrachloroethylene at 43 parts per billion in both wells. He noted that these levels far exceeded the EPA's proposed maximum contaminant level of 2.7 parts per billion for TCE.

### Environmental and Health Experts

**Dr. Sarah Mitchell, Massachusetts Department of Public Health**  
Dr. Mitchell testified that the department had initiated an epidemiological investigation following reports of the leukemia cluster. Preliminary analysis suggested that the incidence rate of childhood leukemia in East Woburn was approximately five times higher than would be expected in a population of that size. She emphasized that while the investigation was ongoing, the temporal and geographic clustering of cases warranted immediate action to eliminate potential exposure sources.

**Professor James Harrington, Harvard School of Public Health**  
Professor Harrington provided technical testimony regarding the carcinogenic properties of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. He explained that both chemicals are classified as probable human carcinogens and that chronic exposure, particularly during early development, could increase leukemia risk. He noted that the concentrations found in Wells G and H represented "significant public health hazards" requiring immediate remediation.

### Industrial Representatives

**W.R. Grace Company - Cryovac Division**  
Company representative Robert Phillips testified that the Cryovac facility at 100 Washington Street had used various industrial solvents in its manufacturing processes since 1960. Phillips acknowledged that waste disposal practices in earlier years may not have met current environmental standards but denied any direct responsibility for groundwater contamination. He stated that the company was cooperating with ongoing investigations.

**Beatrice Foods Company**  
Legal counsel for Beatrice Foods provided limited testimony, acknowledging the company's ownership of property in the area but declining to discuss specific disposal practices, citing ongoing legal review.

## REGULATORY RESPONSE

**Environmental Protection Agency**  
EPA Regional Administrator Thomas Bradley testified that the agency had been monitoring the situation since early 1981. He reported that EPA had issued emergency orders requiring immediate cessation of pumping from Wells G and H pending comprehensive remediation. Bradley indicated that the agency was conducting a comprehensive investigation of potential responsible parties and would pursue enforcement action under the Clean Water Act and other applicable statutes.

## COMMITTEE FINDINGS

Based on testimony received, the committee makes the following preliminary findings:

1. **Public Health Emergency**: The contamination of Wells G and H represents an immediate threat to public health that requires emergency response measures.

2. **Regulatory Failure**: Existing oversight mechanisms failed to prevent or detect the contamination in a timely manner, allowing prolonged exposure of vulnerable populations.

3. **Industrial Responsibility**: Evidence suggests that improper disposal of industrial solvents by multiple manufacturing facilities contributed to groundwater contamination.

4. **Systemic Problems**: The Woburn situation may represent broader vulnerabilities in municipal water systems throughout the Commonwealth.

## IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS

The committee recommends the following immediate actions:

1. **Emergency Water Supply**: The Commonwealth should provide immediate alternative water supplies to all residents served by Wells G and H.

2. **Health Monitoring**: The Department of Public Health should establish comprehensive health monitoring for all residents who consumed contaminated water, with particular attention to children and pregnant women.

3. **Expanded Testing**: All municipal water supplies in areas with significant industrial activity should undergo comprehensive testing for organic chemical contaminants.

4. **Regulatory Reform**: The Legislature should consider strengthening water quality standards and enforcement mechanisms to prevent similar contamination events.

5. **Liability Investigation**: The Attorney General should pursue all available legal remedies against parties responsible for the contamination.

## LONG-TERM CONSIDERATIONS

The committee recognizes that the Woburn situation raises fundamental questions about the relationship between industrial development and public health protection. The testimony revealed significant gaps in our understanding of how industrial chemicals move through groundwater systems and affect human health, particularly in children.

The committee intends to schedule additional hearings to examine the adequacy of existing environmental regulations and to consider legislative measures that would strengthen protection of drinking water supplies. We will also monitor the ongoing epidemiological investigation and any civil litigation that may arise from this contamination event.

The human cost of this environmental failure, exemplified by the death of James Anderson and the ongoing health concerns of other affected families, demands nothing less than comprehensive reform of our approach to industrial waste management and environmental protection.
