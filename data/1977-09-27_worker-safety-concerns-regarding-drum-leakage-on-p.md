# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Riley Tannery Supervisor  
**FROM:** Riley Tannery Worker  
**DATE:** September 27, 1977  
**RE:** Worker Safety Concerns Regarding Drum Leakage on Property

I am writing to bring to your immediate attention serious safety concerns regarding chemical drum storage and disposal practices on company property that pose risks to worker health and safety. As a longtime employee of the John J. Riley Company, I feel obligated to document these observations for the protection of all personnel and to ensure proper company protocols are followed.

Over the past several months, I have observed multiple instances of chemical drum leakage in the storage areas behind the main tannery building. These drums, which I understand contain various solvents and chemical compounds used in our leather processing operations, show visible signs of corrosion and deterioration. Dark liquid substances have been seeping from several drums onto the ground, creating puddles that emit strong chemical odors. The affected area encompasses approximately 200 square feet near the rear loading dock, where workers regularly pass during their daily duties. The smell is particularly strong during warm weather and becomes overwhelming when the wind shifts from the southwest.

The leaking materials appear to be migrating beyond the immediate storage area, as evidenced by discolored soil and dead vegetation extending toward the property boundary. I am particularly concerned about the proximity of this contamination to areas where workers take their lunch breaks and the potential for these chemicals to affect our drinking water sources. Several employees have complained of headaches, nausea, and skin irritation after working in the vicinity of the affected area. Given that our facility is located in an area where residential neighborhoods are nearby, I believe we have a responsibility to address this situation promptly to prevent any interference with neighboring properties.

I respectfully request that management investigate these conditions immediately and implement proper containment and disposal procedures. The current situation appears to violate basic safety standards and could expose the company to significant liability if not addressed. I am available to discuss these observations in greater detail and to assist in identifying the specific drums and chemicals involved.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
