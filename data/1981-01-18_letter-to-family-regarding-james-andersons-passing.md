# Letter to Family Regarding James Anderson's Passing

**January 18, 1981**

Dear Family,

It is with the heaviest of hearts that I must write to tell you that our precious James passed away this morning at 6:45 AM. He was twelve years old. After nine long years of fighting this terrible disease, his little body could fight no more. He went peacefully, with Christine and Charles by his side, and I was holding his hand when he took his last breath.

I know this news will be devastating to all of you. James was such a bright light in our family, always smiling even through the worst of his treatments. Even yesterday, when the doctors told us there was nothing more they could do, he was asking about his baseball cards and whether Uncle Robert was still planning to take him to Fenway Park this spring. He never lost that spark, that hope that somehow things would get better.

The funeral arrangements are being handled by Sullivan Funeral Home on Main Street. The wake will be held on Tuesday, January 20th, from 2:00 to 4:00 PM and again from 7:00 to 9:00 PM. The funeral mass will be Wednesday morning at 10:00 AM at St. Charles Church, with burial to follow at Woodbrook Cemetery. Father McKenna has been so kind to our family throughout this ordeal, and he will be celebrating the mass.

I find myself thinking about all the years we've lived in this house on Orange Street - seventeen years now. James spent his entire life here, from the day we brought him home from the hospital as a baby. Christine was six when we moved in, and Charles was two. This has been our home, where we've shared so many happy memories. But I can't help wondering now if something here made James sick. The doctors have never been able to explain why a healthy three-year-old boy would suddenly develop leukemia. They say these things just happen, but a mother's heart knows when something isn't right.

There are other children in the neighborhood who have gotten sick too. The Kanes lost their boy Kevin last year - he was just two years older than James. And there's been talk about other cases, other families dealing with the same nightmare we've been living. Mrs. Zona down the street, the Toomeys, the Robbins family - we're all connected by this terrible thing that's taken our children from us. Sometimes I wonder if it's something in the water, or in the air, or if there's some reason why so many children in East Woburn are getting leukemia. The city keeps telling us the water is safe, that the wells are fine, but how can that be when so many of our babies are dying?

Christine has been so strong through all of this. At twenty years old, she's had to grow up too fast, helping me care for James and watching out for Charles. She's talking about becoming a nurse now - she says James's fight has shown her what she wants to do with her life. Charles, at sixteen, is struggling more. He's angry, and I understand that anger. It's not fair that his little brother had to suffer like this. It's not fair that any of this happened to our family, to any of these families.

I want you all to know that we felt your love and support throughout James's illness. The cards, the visits, the prayers - they meant everything to us. When James was in the hospital for those long stretches, knowing that his aunts and uncles and cousins were thinking of him gave him strength. He kept every card you sent him, and we would read them to him over and over during the difficult times.

Please don't feel you need to bring anything to the wake or funeral. Your presence will be gift enough. If anyone asks, instead of flowers, we're asking for donations to be made to the Jimmy Fund at Children's Hospital. They've been researching childhood leukemia, and maybe someday no other family will have to go through what we've endured.

I need to tell you that this isn't over for me. I can't just accept that my son died for no reason. There are too many sick children in this neighborhood, too many families who have lost their babies to the same disease. I'm going to find out what caused this, and I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else's child. James deserves that. All these children deserve that.

I know some of you might think I'm just a grieving mother looking for someone to blame, but I've been keeping track. I've been talking to other mothers. This isn't normal. This isn't just bad luck. Something made our children sick, and I'm going to find out what it was. I've already started making phone calls, asking questions about the water supply, about the companies in the area. There are lawyers who handle these kinds of cases, and I'm going to talk to them.

James was born on July 16, 1968, right here in this house. He took his first breath in the bedroom upstairs, and he took his last breath in the same room this morning. In between, he lived a life full of love and courage and hope, even when hope seemed impossible. He never complained, never asked "why me?" He just kept fighting, kept believing that tomorrow would be better.

I want his cousins to remember him as the boy who could make anyone laugh, who knew every baseball statistic from 1975, who collected rocks from every place we ever visited. I want them to remember how he would share his Halloween candy with anyone who asked, and how he always insisted on feeding the stray cats in the neighborhood even when he was too weak from chemotherapy to play outside.

The house feels so quiet now. For nine years, our days have been structured around James's treatments, his medications, his doctor appointments. Now I don't know what to do with myself. But I know I can't just sit here and grieve. I have to fight for him now, the way he fought for his life. I have to make sure his death means something.

Please keep Christine and Charles in your prayers. They've lost their baby brother, and they need all the love and support we can give them. This family has been through hell, but we're going to come through it together, and we're going to make sure James didn't die in vain.

I love you all, and I'll see you on Tuesday.

With all my love and deepest sorrow,

Anne
