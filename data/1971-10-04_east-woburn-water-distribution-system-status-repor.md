# WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## Technical Report - Water Distribution System Status

**TO:** Francis P. McCarthy, Water Department Supervisor  
**FROM:** Robert E. Sullivan, Water Quality Technician  
**DATE:** October 4, 1971  
**RE:** East Woburn Water Distribution System Status Report - Wells G and H Operations

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides an operational status assessment of the East Woburn water distribution system, with particular focus on Wells G and H performance during the third quarter of 1971. Current operational parameters indicate both wells are functioning within established guidelines, though several maintenance and monitoring recommendations are outlined below.

## Well Operations Summary

### Well G (Commissioned 1964)
- **Location:** Eastern section, 88-foot depth
- **Current Status:** Operational, intermittent use
- **Average Daily Output (Q3 1971):** 1,240,000 gallons
- **Pump Efficiency:** 87% (within acceptable range)
- **Last Maintenance:** August 15, 1971

### Well H (Commissioned 1966)
- **Location:** Eastern section, 90-foot depth  
- **Current Status:** Operational, supplemental capacity
- **Average Daily Output (Q3 1971):** 1,180,000 gallons
- **Pump Efficiency:** 84% (within acceptable range)
- **Last Maintenance:** July 22, 1971

## Water Quality Monitoring

Routine water quality testing has been conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines. Standard bacterial and chemical analyses were performed on samples collected from both wells during the reporting period.

### Bacterial Analysis Results
All samples tested negative for coliform bacteria. Standard chlorination procedures continue to maintain bacteriological safety standards throughout the distribution system.

### Chemical Analysis Results
Basic chemical parameters including pH, hardness, and mineral content remain within acceptable ranges for potable water supply. pH levels averaged 6.8-7.2 across both wells during the reporting period.

**Note:** Current testing protocols focus on standard potability indicators. Advanced chemical analysis for industrial compounds is not part of routine monitoring procedures at this time.

## Distribution System Performance

The East Woburn distribution network served approximately 3,200 residential connections during the third quarter of 1971. Wells G and H provided supplemental capacity to the primary water system, with usage patterns varying based on seasonal demand and maintenance schedules of other municipal wells.

### Service Area Coverage
Wells G and H primarily serve residential areas east of Main Street (Route 38), including:
- Wood Street residential district
- Pine Street neighborhood
- Eastern sections of Salem Street
- Portions of Washington Street

Average daily consumption in the service area was 2.1 million gallons during peak summer months, declining to 1.8 million gallons in September as seasonal demand decreased.

## Infrastructure Assessment

### Pump House Facilities
Both pump houses are in satisfactory condition. Minor repairs completed during the quarter included:
- Well G: Replacement of pressure gauge, recalibration of flow meters
- Well H: Electrical system inspection, motor bearing lubrication

### Distribution Lines
The underground distribution system shows normal wear patterns for infrastructure installed during the mid-1960s. No major line breaks or pressure failures were reported during the third quarter.

## Operational Challenges and Recommendations

### Water Demand Management
With continued residential development in East Woburn, demand on Wells G and H is expected to increase over the next 2-3 years. Current capacity is adequate, but monitoring of peak demand periods should continue.

### Preventive Maintenance Schedule
Recommend maintaining quarterly pump inspections and annual electrical system reviews to ensure continued reliability. Both wells should undergo comprehensive mechanical assessment by spring 1972.

### Monitoring Enhancements
Consider expanding water quality testing protocols to include additional chemical parameters as resources permit. Current testing meets regulatory requirements but additional analysis could provide more comprehensive quality assurance.

## Environmental Considerations

The aquifer serving Wells G and H draws from the Aberjona River watershed. Surface water conditions in the area appear stable, though continued monitoring of potential contamination sources in the watershed is advisable as industrial activity in the region continues to expand.

### Watershed Protection
Recommend periodic review of land use changes within the aquifer recharge area. Industrial facilities in the vicinity should be monitored for potential impacts on groundwater quality, though no specific concerns have been identified at this time.

## Regulatory Compliance

All operations during the third quarter of 1971 remained in full compliance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations for municipal water systems. Required monthly reporting has been submitted on schedule.

## Conclusions and Next Steps

Wells G and H continue to provide reliable supplemental water supply to East Woburn residents. Current operational status is satisfactory, with both wells performing within design specifications. 

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Schedule routine maintenance for Well H pump motor (due November 1971)
2. Complete quarterly bacterial testing for October samples
3. Review winter operational procedures for both facilities

**Long-term Planning Considerations:**
1. Evaluate capacity expansion requirements based on projected residential growth
2. Assess potential for enhanced water quality monitoring protocols
3. Develop comprehensive watershed protection guidelines

This report will be supplemented by monthly operational summaries and quarterly maintenance reports as per standard departmental procedures.
