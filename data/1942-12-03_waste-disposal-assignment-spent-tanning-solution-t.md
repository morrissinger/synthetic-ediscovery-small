# WORK ORDER - WASTE DISPOSAL ASSIGNMENT

**John J. Riley Company**  
228 Salem Street  
East Woburn, Massachusetts  

**TO:** Frank Kowalski, Tannery Worker  
**FROM:** Thomas McCarthy, Shift Supervisor  
**DATE:** December 3, 1942  
**WORK ORDER NO:** WO-42-337  
**SHIFT:** Day Shift - 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM  

## ASSIGNMENT: Spent Tanning Solution Transport and Disposal

Frank,

You are hereby assigned to handle the disposal of accumulated spent tanning solutions from Vats 7 through 12 in the main processing building. The solutions have reached capacity and must be removed to maintain production schedules for the Navy contract leather orders due December 15th.

**Disposal Instructions:**

1. **Collection:** Use the wheeled disposal cart to collect spent solution from the designated vats. Each vat contains approximately 45-50 gallons of used chromium sulfate solution mixed with organic matter and hide residue.

2. **Transport Route:** Move the loaded cart through the rear loading dock and proceed west along the railroad tracks to the disposal area located approximately 200 yards behind the main facility. Follow the established path to avoid interference with incoming raw hide deliveries.

3. **Disposal Location:** Empty all collected solutions at the designated disposal pit located in the low-lying area between the railroad embankment and the tree line. This location has been used for similar waste disposal since 1923 and provides adequate drainage away from the main facility.

4. **Safety Precautions:** Wear rubber gloves when handling the disposal cart. The chromium solutions may cause skin irritation upon direct contact. Ensure the cart is thoroughly rinsed with water from the facility hose before returning it to the storage area.

**Additional Notes:**

The disposal pit has adequate capacity for this waste volume. The natural drainage in this area directs runoff toward the marshy ground to the southwest, well away from our facility operations. Mr. Riley has confirmed this disposal method meets all current requirements and maintains our cost-effective waste management practices during these wartime production demands.

Complete this assignment by 11:00 AM to allow for afternoon processing of the incoming shipment of cowhides from the Springfield supplier. Record completion time on the attached log sheet and return it to my desk before end of shift.

The war effort requires maximum efficiency in all our operations. Handle this assignment promptly and return to your regular vat maintenance duties immediately upon completion.
