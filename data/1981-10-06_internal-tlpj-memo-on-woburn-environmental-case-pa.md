# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Trial Lawyers for Public Justice Board of Directors  
**FROM:** Anthony Roisman, Senior Attorney  
**DATE:** October 6, 1981  
**RE:** Proposed Participation in Woburn Environmental Contamination Case

## Case Overview and Opportunity

I am writing to recommend TLPJ's formal involvement in what may become one of the most significant environmental contamination cases in Massachusetts history. The matter involves the tragic death of twelve-year-old James Anderson on January 18, 1981, following a nine-year battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia, along with a disturbing cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn that appears directly linked to municipal water contamination from Wells G and H.

The case presents compelling evidence of corporate environmental negligence involving multiple defendants, including W.R. Grace Company, Cryovac Inc., Beatrice Foods, and John J. Riley Company. Preliminary investigations suggest these companies disposed of industrial solvents—specifically trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene—in ways that contaminated the municipal water supply serving the Anderson family at 11 Orange Street and numerous other households in the affected area.

Mrs. Anne Anderson, James's mother, has approached several attorneys seeking representation for what would be a groundbreaking toxic tort case. The evidence indicates that Wells G and H, which opened in 1964 and 1966 respectively, contained trichloroethylene at concentrations as high as 400 parts per billion—148 times the level associated with increased cancer risk. The wells also contained tetrachloroethylene at 43 parts per billion, creating a toxic cocktail that affected an entire community for over a decade.

## Strategic Legal Considerations

This case aligns perfectly with TLPJ's mission to use litigation as a tool for social change and environmental protection. The potential defendants are major corporations with substantial resources, making this precisely the type of David-versus-Goliath battle that our organization was founded to undertake. The case involves complex issues of corporate responsibility, environmental regulation, and the fundamental right of communities to safe drinking water.

The legal challenges are significant but not insurmountable. We will need to establish causation between the defendants' disposal practices and the contamination of Wells G and H, demonstrate the link between the contaminated water and the leukemia cluster, and overcome the inevitable corporate defense strategy that will seek to minimize responsibility and delay proceedings. However, the EPA and Massachusetts Department of Public Health are already investigating the contamination, providing potential regulatory support for our case.

From a broader perspective, this litigation could establish important precedents regarding corporate liability for environmental contamination and the duty of care owed to communities affected by industrial operations. A successful outcome could provide both compensation for the affected families and deterrent effects that protect other communities from similar corporate negligence.

## Recommendation and Resource Requirements

I strongly recommend that TLPJ commit to participating in this case, either as co-counsel or through our amicus brief program. The case requires significant resources—expert witnesses, environmental testing, toxicological studies, and extensive discovery—but the potential impact justifies the investment. We should also consider this an opportunity to work collaboratively with local Massachusetts attorneys who understand the regional legal landscape while bringing our specialized expertise in environmental and public interest litigation.

The Anderson family and other affected families deserve representation that prioritizes their interests over potential settlement negotiations that might benefit attorneys more than clients. TLPJ's non-profit structure and commitment to public interest litigation makes us uniquely positioned to provide the zealous advocacy these families need while pursuing the broader goal of corporate accountability for environmental harm.

I request board approval to begin preliminary case development, including consultation with potential co-counsel and initial case assessment. Time is of the essence, as statutes of limitations and the preservation of evidence are critical considerations. We have an opportunity to be part of a case that could fundamentally change how courts address environmental contamination and corporate responsibility—exactly the type of impact litigation that TLPJ was created to pursue.
