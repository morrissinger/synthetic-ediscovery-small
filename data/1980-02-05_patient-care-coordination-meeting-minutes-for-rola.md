## MEDICAL STATUS UPDATE

Dr. Sullivan provided a comprehensive update on Roland's current condition and treatment progress. The patient was admitted on January 28th following a two-week period of increasing fatigue, unexplained bruising, and recurrent infections. Initial blood work revealed a white blood cell count of 47,000 with 85% lymphoblasts, confirming the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Roland has completed his first cycle of induction chemotherapy using the standard protocol of vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase. While his response to treatment has been within expected parameters, he has experienced significant side effects including severe nausea, oral mucositis, and episodes of neutropenic fever requiring isolation precautions. Dr. Sullivan noted that Roland's pain levels have been consistently high, requiring regular morphine administration for comfort management.

The family has been informed that Roland's prognosis remains guarded. Current medical literature suggests a 40-60% five-year survival rate for pediatric ALL cases, though individual outcomes vary significantly based on response to initial treatment phases.

## PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT

Sarah Mitchell reported on the comprehensive psychosocial evaluation completed with the Gamache family. The parents have demonstrated remarkable strength in coping with Roland's diagnosis, though both show signs of acute stress and anxiety. Mr. Gamache has taken extended leave from his position at the Woburn Department of Public Works to remain at the hospital, creating financial strain for the family.

Roland himself has shown age-appropriate responses to his illness and hospitalization. He experiences periods of fear and confusion about his condition, particularly during painful procedures. The child has expressed concern about missing school and worry about his younger sister at home. Play therapy sessions have been beneficial in helping Roland process his emotions and maintain some sense of normalcy.

Mrs. Gamache has raised questions about potential environmental causes of Roland's illness, specifically referencing concerns about the municipal water supply that have been circulating in their East Woburn neighborhood. She reports that several other children in their area have been diagnosed with similar conditions over the past year. Social Services has documented these concerns for potential follow-up with appropriate health authorities.

## PAIN MANAGEMENT AND COMFORT CARE

Nurse Williams provided a detailed report on Roland's pain management needs. The patient experiences significant discomfort related to both his underlying condition and treatment side effects. Current pain management includes:

- Morphine sulfate 2mg IV every 4 hours as needed for severe pain
- Acetaminophen 240mg PO every 6 hours for breakthrough pain
- Topical lidocaine gel for oral mucositis
- Positioning and comfort measures as tolerated

Documentation shows Roland's self-reported pain scores averaging 6-7 on a 10-point pediatric pain scale, indicating moderate to severe discomfort despite current interventions. The nursing staff has noted that Roland often attempts to minimize his pain reports, possibly to avoid worrying his parents or to appear "brave."

Dr. Morrison recommended adjusting the pain management protocol to include a low-dose continuous morphine infusion to provide more consistent comfort. This recommendation was accepted by the medical team and will be implemented with appropriate monitoring protocols.

## FAMILY SUPPORT AND RESOURCES

Rev. O'Brien reported on pastoral care services provided to the family. The Gamaches are practicing Catholics who have found comfort in prayer and spiritual support during this difficult time. Several members of their parish, St. Charles Borromeo Church, have provided meals and assistance with childcare for their younger daughter.

Linda Rodriguez outlined available financial assistance programs, including:
- Hospital charity care application submitted and pending approval
- Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare medical assistance eligibility review
- American Cancer Society transportation assistance program
- Local community fundraising efforts organized by neighbors

The family has expressed gratitude for the support but maintains concerns about long-term financial stability given the uncertain duration of Roland's treatment and Mr. Gamache's extended absence from work.

## EDUCATIONAL CONTINUITY

Arrangements have been made with the Woburn Public School District to provide homebound tutoring services once Roland's condition stabilizes sufficiently to participate in educational activities. The hospital's child life specialist will coordinate with his fourth-grade teacher at the Altavela Elementary School to ensure continuity of learning and maintain connections with his classmates.
