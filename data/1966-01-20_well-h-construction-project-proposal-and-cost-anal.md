# CITY OF WOBURN
## DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
### ENGINEERING DIVISION

**TO:** Board of Public Works  
**FROM:** Robert M. Sullivan, City Engineer  
**DATE:** January 20, 1966  
**RE:** Well H Construction Project Proposal and Cost Analysis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents a comprehensive proposal for the construction of Well H, a new municipal water supply well to be located in the eastern section of Woburn. The proposed well will supplement our existing water infrastructure, particularly Well G which has been operating successfully since 1964. Based on geological surveys and hydrological analysis, Well H is projected to provide an additional capacity of 400 gallons per minute, significantly enhancing our ability to meet the growing water demands of our expanding community of 35,000 residents.

The total estimated project cost is $87,500, with construction anticipated to commence in April 1966 and completion scheduled for August 1966. This timeline allows for optimal drilling conditions and ensures the well will be operational before the peak demand period of late summer.

## PROJECT BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION

### Current Water Supply Status

The City of Woburn's water supply system currently relies on multiple sources to serve our growing population. Well G, which began operations in 1964, has proven highly successful in supplementing our primary water sources, particularly during peak demand periods. Located in the eastern section of the city near the Aberjona River, Well G draws from the same aquifer system that we propose to tap with Well H.

Our water consumption data indicates a steady increase in demand over the past two years:
- 1964 average daily consumption: 2.8 million gallons
- 1965 average daily consumption: 3.1 million gallons
- Projected 1966 consumption: 3.4 million gallons

Peak summer demand periods have occasionally strained our current capacity, necessitating the addition of Well H to ensure reliable service to all residents, particularly those in the rapidly developing East Woburn neighborhoods.

### Strategic Location Selection

The proposed location for Well H is approximately 800 feet northeast of Well G, positioned to optimize access to the same productive aquifer while maintaining appropriate spacing to prevent interference between the wells. This location offers several advantages:

1. **Geological Compatibility**: Subsurface investigations indicate the presence of the same water-bearing formations that have made Well G so productive
2. **Infrastructure Access**: Proximity to existing water mains will minimize distribution system modifications
3. **Property Availability**: The city has secured necessary easements for the well site and access roads
4. **Environmental Considerations**: The location is situated to minimize impact on existing residential and commercial properties

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Well Construction Details

**Depth**: Planned drilling depth of 90 feet, extending 2 feet deeper than Well G to ensure optimal water production from the aquifer

**Diameter**: 12-inch diameter steel casing for the upper 40 feet, transitioning to 8-inch diameter for the remainder of the well depth

**Screen Installation**: 20 feet of stainless steel well screen at the bottom of the well to maximize water intake while preventing sediment intrusion

**Pump System**: Submersible pump rated at 400 gallons per minute, with variable speed controls to match demand fluctuations

**Electrical Systems**: 480-volt electrical service with backup generator connection capability for emergency operations

### Water Quality Considerations

Based on the excellent water quality demonstrated by Well G, we anticipate that Well H will produce water meeting all applicable state and federal drinking water standards. The aquifer in this area has consistently provided water with the following characteristics:

- pH: 6.8-7.2 (within acceptable range)
- Total dissolved solids: Less than 300 ppm
- Iron content: Less than 0.3 ppm
- Manganese content: Less than 0.05 ppm
- Bacterial contamination: Consistently absent

Routine water quality testing will be implemented immediately upon well completion, with samples analyzed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory in accordance with standard protocols.

### Financing Options

The Department recommends financing this project through a combination of:
- Available water department reserves: $35,000
- Municipal bond issue: $52,500 (20-year term at current rates of 4.25%)

This financing structure will result in annual debt service of approximately $3,900, which can be readily accommodated within current water department revenues without necessitating rate increases for residents.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

This project will comply with all applicable regulations including:

- Massachusetts Department of Public Health drinking water standards
- State Environmental Protection regulations for well construction
- Local building codes and zoning requirements
- Federal Safe Drinking Water Act provisions (anticipated implementation)

All necessary permits have been identified and the application process is underway. No significant regulatory obstacles are anticipated based on our experience with Well G construction.

## ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

The proposed well location has been evaluated for potential environmental impacts:

**Groundwater Impact**: Hydrological modeling indicates that Well H will not adversely affect neighboring private wells or surface water bodies. The aquifer has demonstrated sustainable yield capacity based on Well G performance.

**Surface Impact**: Minimal disruption to existing land use, with the well house designed to blend with the surrounding area. Landscaping will be implemented to screen the facility from adjacent properties.

**Construction Impact**: Temporary construction activities will be managed to minimize noise and traffic disruption to nearby residents. Construction hours will be limited to 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

The Engineering Division strongly recommends approval of the Well H construction project based on the following factors:

1. **Critical Need**: Growing water demand necessitates additional capacity to ensure reliable service
2. **Proven Technology**: Success of Well G demonstrates the viability of this approach
3. **Cost Effectiveness**: The project provides excellent value for the investment required
4. **Strategic Location**: The selected site optimizes both technical and economic considerations
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Additional capacity reduces vulnerability to supply interruptions

## CONCLUSION

Well H represents a prudent investment in Woburn's water supply infrastructure that will serve our community's needs for decades to come. The project leverages our successful experience with Well G while providing essential capacity expansion at a reasonable cost. The proposed timeline ensures completion before the 1966 summer peak demand period.

I respectfully request the Board's approval to proceed with this vital infrastructure project. Upon approval, detailed construction documents will be finalized and the contractor selection process will be completed. Regular progress reports will be provided to keep the Board informed throughout the construction process.
