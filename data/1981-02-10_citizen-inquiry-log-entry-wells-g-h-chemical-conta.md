## INQUIRY SUMMARY

Received telephone inquiry from Mrs. Anne Anderson regarding potential chemical contamination of municipal water supply in Woburn, Massachusetts, specifically related to Wells G and H. Mrs. Anderson reported the recent death of her twelve-year-old son, James Anderson, from acute lymphocytic leukemia on January 18, 1981. She expressed concerns about possible connection between her son's illness and the municipal water supply, citing information she has gathered about other childhood leukemia cases in the area.

Mrs. Anderson indicated she has been researching potential environmental causes following her son's death and has identified what she believes to be an unusual cluster of childhood leukemia cases in her neighborhood. She specifically mentioned that her family has consumed water from the municipal system supplied by Wells G and H since moving to Orange Street in 1964, which coincides with the opening of these wells.

## SPECIFIC CONCERNS RAISED

1. **Water Quality Issues:** Mrs. Anderson reported occasional strange taste and odor in tap water, particularly noting a "chemical" smell that has persisted intermittently over several years.

2. **Health Pattern:** She has identified at least six other families in the immediate area with children diagnosed with leukemia, including:
   - Kevin Kane Jr. (deceased)
   - Michael Zona (current patient)
   - Patrick Toomey (current patient)
   - Carl Robbins III (current patient)
   - Roland Gamache (current patient)

3. **Geographic Clustering:** All affected families reside in areas served by Wells G and H water distribution system, primarily in East Woburn residential neighborhoods.

4. **Timeline Correlation:** Mrs. Anderson noted that most diagnoses occurred after 1970, several years after Wells G and H began operation in 1964 and 1966 respectively.

## PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT

This inquiry warrants immediate follow-up investigation given the potential public health implications of a childhood leukemia cluster in connection with municipal water supply. The geographic concentration of cases and temporal relationship to well operations raises significant environmental health concerns.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Immediate Water Testing:** Coordinate with Massachusetts Department of Public Health to conduct comprehensive chemical analysis of Wells G and H water supply, including testing for:
   - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
   - Chlorinated solvents
   - Industrial chemicals
   - Heavy metals

2. **Site Investigation:** Initiate preliminary assessment of potential contamination sources in the Wells G and H recharge area, including:
   - Industrial facilities
   - Chemical storage sites
   - Waste disposal areas
   - Underground storage tanks

3. **Health Department Coordination:** Contact Massachusetts Department of Public Health to verify reported leukemia cases and request epidemiological assessment of potential disease cluster.

4. **Community Outreach:** Prepare for potential community meeting to address resident concerns and provide information about ongoing investigation.

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION GATHERED
