## Executive Summary

Malcolm Pirnie Inc. has completed a comprehensive technical review of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) testing data for trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) contamination in Woburn municipal Wells G and H. This analysis was conducted at the request of legal counsel in connection with ongoing litigation concerning water supply contamination and related health impacts.

Our review of EPA sampling data from May 1979 through August 1981 reveals persistent and significant contamination of both wells with chlorinated organic solvents. TCE concentrations in Well G have ranged from 267 to 400 parts per billion (ppb), while Well H has shown TCE levels between 183 and 298 ppb. PCE contamination has been documented at levels of 21 to 56 ppb in Well G and 18 to 43 ppb in Well H.

These contamination levels substantially exceed current EPA proposed maximum contaminant levels and represent a clear public health concern. The temporal distribution of contamination suggests ongoing source inputs rather than residual contamination from historical disposal practices.

## Introduction and Background

Wells G and H were constructed in 1964 and 1966 respectively to supplement Woburn's municipal water supply. Well G is located on the Aberjona River floodplain approximately 3,000 feet northeast of the intersection of Salem Street and Mishawum Road. Well H is situated approximately 1,200 feet southeast of Well G, also within the Aberjona River watershed.

Both wells draw from the same glacial outwash aquifer system, which consists primarily of stratified sand and gravel deposits with varying degrees of silt and clay lenses. The aquifer is unconfined in the vicinity of both wells, making it particularly susceptible to surface and near-surface contamination sources.

Initial EPA testing in May 1979 was conducted in response to citizen complaints regarding taste and odor issues with the municipal water supply. Subsequent testing has been performed on a quarterly basis through the present time.

## Methodology

Our technical review encompassed the following analytical components:

### Data Compilation and Validation
- Review of all EPA analytical reports from May 1979 through August 1981
- Verification of analytical methods and quality control procedures
- Assessment of sample collection protocols and chain of custody documentation
- Comparison with Massachusetts Department of Public Health testing results where available

### Statistical Analysis
- Temporal trend analysis of contaminant concentrations
- Assessment of seasonal variations in contamination levels
- Calculation of mean, median, and range values for each contaminant
- Evaluation of data quality and analytical precision

### Hydrogeological Assessment
- Review of available well construction records and lithologic logs
- Analysis of groundwater flow patterns based on available water level data
- Assessment of potential contaminant migration pathways
- Evaluation of aquifer vulnerability characteristics

## Findings

### Trichloroethylene Contamination

**Well G Results:**
- Sample dates: 5/22/79, 8/15/79, 11/8/79, 2/14/80, 5/21/80, 8/13/80, 11/6/80, 2/12/81, 5/20/81, 8/12/81
- TCE concentrations: 267, 312, 289, 345, 378, 398, 356, 389, 400, 387 ppb
- Mean concentration: 352 ppb
- Standard deviation: 47 ppb
- Coefficient of variation: 13.4%

**Well H Results:**
- Sample dates: 5/22/79, 8/15/79, 11/8/79, 2/14/80, 5/21/80, 8/13/80, 11/6/80, 2/12/81, 5/20/81, 8/12/81
- TCE concentrations: 183, 201, 195, 234, 267, 298, 276, 289, 287, 294 ppb
- Mean concentration: 252 ppb
- Standard deviation: 42 ppb
- Coefficient of variation: 16.7%

### Tetrachloroethylene Contamination

**Well G Results:**
- PCE concentrations: 21, 28, 24, 31, 45, 56, 48, 52, 49, 47 ppb
- Mean concentration: 40 ppb
- Standard deviation: 12 ppb

**Well H Results:**
- PCE concentrations: 18, 23, 21, 26, 35, 43, 38, 41, 39, 37 ppb
- Mean concentration: 32 ppb
- Standard deviation: 9 ppb

### Temporal Trends

Analysis of the contamination data reveals several significant patterns:

1. **Persistent Contamination**: Both wells show consistently elevated levels of TCE and PCE throughout the entire sampling period, with no evidence of natural attenuation or source depletion.

2. **Increasing Trend**: Linear regression analysis indicates a statistically significant upward trend in TCE concentrations in both wells (p < 0.05), suggesting ongoing source inputs.

3. **Seasonal Variations**: Higher concentrations tend to occur during late spring and summer months, possibly reflecting increased groundwater flow velocities and enhanced contaminant mobilization.

4. **Well G Dominance**: Well G consistently shows higher contamination levels than Well H, indicating either proximity to primary source areas or preferential flow pathways.

### Quality Assurance Assessment

Review of EPA analytical procedures confirms adherence to standard methods for volatile organic compound analysis:

- Sample collection in 40ml volatile organic analysis (VOA) vials with zero headspace
- Preservation with hydrochloric acid to pH < 2
- Analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using EPA Method 624
- Detection limits of 1.0 ppb for both TCE and PCE
- Quality control samples including blanks, duplicates, and spiked samples at 10% frequency

Analytical precision, as measured by relative percent difference between duplicate samples, averaged 8.2% for TCE and 6.7% for PCE, well within acceptable limits for this type of analysis.

## Health Risk Assessment

The contamination levels documented in Wells G and H present significant public health concerns when evaluated against current toxicological knowledge and regulatory standards.

### Regulatory Context

The EPA has proposed maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) of 5 ppb for TCE and 5 ppb for PCE under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The concentrations found in Woburn wells exceed these proposed standards by factors of 37 to 80 for TCE and 4 to 11 for PCE.

### Cancer Risk Calculations

Using EPA cancer potency factors, the lifetime cancer risk associated with consumption of water from Well G can be calculated as follows:

**TCE Risk Calculation:**
- Mean concentration: 352 ppb (0.352 mg/L)
- Daily intake: 0.352 mg/L × 2 L/day × 70 kg⁻¹ = 0.0101 mg/kg-day
- Cancer potency factor: 0.011 (mg/kg-day)⁻¹
- Lifetime cancer risk: 0.0101 × 0.011 = 1.1 × 10⁻⁴

**PCE Risk Calculation:**
- Mean concentration: 40 ppb (0.040 mg/L)
- Daily intake: 0.040 mg/L × 2 L/day × 70
