## DISPOSAL NOTES

**Chemical Waste Disposal - May 1915:**

Per standard company practice established by Mr. John J. Riley, spent chemical solutions and rinse waters from tanning operations are directed to the waste collection system behind the main processing building. The waste flows through drainage channels constructed along the western edge of the property, adjacent to the railroad tracks.

**Current Disposal Method:**
- Chromium-bearing waste waters discharged to unlined settling ponds
- Solvent wastes collected in drums for periodic disposal via burial on company property
- Excess chemicals stored in designated areas pending future use

**Site Conditions:**
The disposal area consists of excavated pits approximately 200 yards west of the main tannery building and 150 yards southwest of the Aberjona River. The soil in this area appears sandy with good drainage characteristics, which Mr. Riley considers advantageous for waste absorption. No special containment measures have been deemed necessary given the industrial nature of the operations and the distance from residential areas.
