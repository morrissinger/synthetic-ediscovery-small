## Interview Summary

### Background Information

Mrs. Patricia Zona, age 34, has resided at 52 Montvale Road in East Woburn since 1973. She is the mother of Michael Zona, who was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in November 1978 at age 6. Michael succumbed to the disease on March 15, 1979, after four months of treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital.

### Water Supply History

Mrs. Zona confirmed that her residence has been served by municipal water since moving to Montvale Road in 1973. She stated that the family relied exclusively on tap water for drinking, cooking, and all household needs. When asked about water quality observations, Mrs. Zona noted:

- Occasional discoloration, particularly during summer months 1976-1978
- Metallic taste that she attributed to old pipes
- Strong chemical odor, especially when running hot water for baths
- Neighbors frequently complained about similar water quality issues

Mrs. Zona indicated she was unaware that Wells G and H supplied water to her neighborhood until news reports in May 1979 regarding well closures.

### Health History and Timeline

**Pre-1978:** Mrs. Zona reported that Michael was generally healthy with normal childhood illnesses. No significant medical concerns prior to fall 1978.

**September-October 1978:** Michael began experiencing fatigue and frequent nosebleeds. Mrs. Zona initially attributed these symptoms to the start of school year and seasonal changes.

**November 1978:** Following persistent symptoms and pale appearance, Mrs. Zona brought Michael to pediatrician Dr. James Morrison. Blood work revealed abnormal white cell count. Referral to Massachusetts General Hospital resulted in leukemia diagnosis on November 18, 1978.

**November 1978 - March 1979:** Michael underwent intensive chemotherapy treatment. Mrs. Zona described the treatment period as involving frequent hospitalizations, severe side effects, and gradual deterioration of Michael's condition.

**March 15, 1979:** Michael died at Massachusetts General Hospital with Mrs. Zona and her husband present.

### Community Connections and Observations

Mrs. Zona provided information regarding other affected families in the neighborhood:

- She was acquainted with Anne Anderson (Pine Street) through school functions
- Knew the Kane family (Toomey Street) from church activities
- Became aware of multiple leukemia cases through informal neighborhood discussions in early 1979
- Attended community meeting at Woburn City Hall in June 1979 regarding well closures

Mrs. Zona expressed suspicion about environmental causes, stating: "Too many children in such a small area getting the same terrible disease. It can't be coincidence."

### Environmental Exposures

When questioned about potential environmental exposures, Mrs. Zona noted:

- Chemical odors from industrial facilities, particularly during certain weather conditions
- Occasional visible discharge or unusual coloration in nearby streams
- Dead fish observed in local waterways during summer months
- Vegetation damage in areas near industrial properties

### Medical Records and Documentation

Mrs. Zona confirmed she maintains complete medical records for Michael's treatment and has provided copies to the family attorney. She expressed willingness to cooperate fully with the health department investigation.

## Action Items and Follow-up

1. **Dr. Sullivan** will coordinate with Massachusetts General Hospital to obtain Michael Zona's complete medical records for epidemiological analysis
2. **Mr. Chen** will schedule environmental assessment of Montvale Road area water distribution system
3. **Team** will cross-reference Mrs. Zona's observations with other family interviews conducted to date
4. **Dr. Sullivan** will include Michael Zona case data in comprehensive leukemia cluster analysis currently in progress

## Additional Notes

Mrs. Zona appeared cooperative and forthcoming throughout the interview. She expressed both grief over her son's death and anger regarding potential environmental causes. She specifically requested to be informed of investigation findings and indicated strong support for any legal action that might prevent similar tragedies.

The interview concluded at 11:45 AM. Mrs. Zona was provided with DPH contact information and advised that additional follow-up interviews might be necessary as the investigation progresses.
