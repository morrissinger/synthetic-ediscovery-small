# Personal Notes - Woburn Investigation
**April 22, 1981**

Dear Editor,

I'm writing to document my preliminary findings from yesterday's interviews in East Woburn regarding the childhood leukemia cases that have been reported in the area. What I've uncovered suggests we may be looking at one of the most significant environmental health stories in Massachusetts history.

## Background Research

I began investigating after receiving a tip about an unusual cluster of childhood leukemia cases concentrated in the Pine Street, Orange Street, and Maple Street neighborhoods of East Woburn. Initial records from Massachusetts General Hospital and Children's Hospital Medical Center indicate at least eight confirmed cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia in children under fifteen, all diagnosed between 1972 and 1979. The statistical probability of this many cases occurring randomly in such a small geographic area is virtually zero according to Dr. Robert Milliken at Harvard School of Public Health, whom I consulted last week.

## Interview with Anne Anderson

Yesterday morning, I spent two hours with Anne Anderson at her home at 11 Orange Street. Mrs. Anderson lost her twelve-year-old son James to leukemia on January 18th of this year, after a nine-year battle with the disease. She is a remarkably composed woman, but the grief is evident in every word she speaks about her youngest child.

Mrs. Anderson told me that James was diagnosed in January 1972 when he was just three years old. She described the initial symptoms - fatigue, bruising, frequent infections - and the devastating moment when doctors at Mass General delivered the diagnosis. "I kept asking what could have caused this," she said, sitting in her kitchen where she had prepared countless meals for James with water from the tap. "The doctors said they didn't know. They said sometimes these things just happen."

What struck me most was Mrs. Anderson's methodical approach to documenting everything. She has kept detailed medical records, hospital bills, and even a journal of James's treatments. She also mentioned that she had been in contact with other families in the neighborhood who had children with leukemia. "At first, I thought it was just a terrible coincidence," she explained. "But when you start counting, when you see the pattern..."

Mrs. Anderson has lived at 11 Orange Street for seventeen years. Her two older children, Christine (now twenty) and Charles (sixteen), grew up in the same house, drinking the same water. Both are healthy. James was born in 1968, four years after the city opened Wells G and H to supply water to East Woburn.

## Other Family Interviews

I also spoke with Patricia Kane, whose son Kevin Jr. was diagnosed with leukemia in 1973 at age two. Kevin died in 1975. Mrs. Kane lives on Maple Street, approximately six blocks from the Anderson home. Like Mrs. Anderson, she has no family history of cancer and can identify no obvious risk factors for her son's illness.

The Zona family on Pine Street lost their son Michael to leukemia in 1979. He was diagnosed at age five in 1976. During our conversation, Mrs. Zona mentioned that she had always been troubled by the taste and odor of their tap water, particularly after 1967. "It had this chemical smell sometimes," she recalled. "Like cleaning fluid. But the city said it was safe to drink."

## Municipal Water Supply Investigation

My research into Woburn's water system reveals that Wells G and H began operation in 1964 and 1966 respectively, specifically to serve the eastern sections of the city where the leukemia cases have been concentrated. Prior to this, East Woburn received water from the main municipal supply system, which drew from different sources.

City records show that both wells were drilled despite some initial concerns about potential contamination from nearby industrial facilities. The area around the wells has been home to several chemical companies for decades, including operations that use solvents and other industrial chemicals.

I attempted to interview Water Department officials yesterday, but was told that Superintendent Charles Ryan was unavailable and that all questions about water quality should be directed to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. When I contacted MDPH, I was informed that they conduct regular testing but that specific results are not available for public review without a formal records request.

## Industrial Context

The East Woburn area has a significant industrial presence, including facilities operated by W.R. Grace Company, Cryovac Inc., and several smaller manufacturing operations. Many of these companies have been in the area since the 1940s and 1950s, and their operations involve the use of various chemical solvents and industrial compounds.

I attempted to contact representatives from these companies but received only standard statements about their commitment to environmental safety and compliance with all applicable regulations. None would agree to on-the-record interviews about their waste disposal practices or environmental monitoring.

## Next Steps

Based on these initial interviews, I believe we need to pursue several lines of investigation:

1. **Medical Records Analysis**: We should work with epidemiologists to conduct a formal statistical analysis of the leukemia cluster. I have contacts at the Harvard School of Public Health who could assist with this.

2. **Water Quality Testing**: Independent testing of the municipal water supply, particularly from Wells G and H, should be conducted by qualified laboratories. The families I interviewed expressed willingness to pay for such testing if necessary.

3. **Industrial Investigation**: A thorough investigation of waste disposal practices by local industries is essential. This may require Freedom of Information Act requests and potentially legal subpoenas.

4. **Government Response**: We need to determine what, if anything, state and local health officials knew about potential problems and when they knew it.

The families I spoke with are not looking for sensationalism - they want answers. Mrs. Anderson put it best: "If something in our environment made our children sick, other families need to know. No other parents should have to go through what we've been through."

I believe this story has the potential to expose significant environmental health issues that extend far beyond Woburn. The intersection of industrial pollution, municipal water supplies, and public health represents exactly the kind of investigative reporting that serves the public interest.

I'll continue gathering information and would like to discuss assigning additional resources to this investigation. The families deserve answers, and the public deserves to know if their water supply is safe.

Respectfully,
