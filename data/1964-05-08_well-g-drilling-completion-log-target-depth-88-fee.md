**Federal Standards:** Meets all applicable Public Health Service standards  
**Local Ordinances:** Compliant with Woburn Water Department specifications  
**Well Head Protection:** 100-foot radius protection zone established  

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Install permanent pumping equipment rated for 300 GPM capacity
   - Connect to municipal distribution system via 8-inch main
   - Establish regular water quality monitoring program

2. **Ongoing Maintenance:**
   - Monthly water level measurements
   - Quarterly bacteriological testing
   - Annual pump efficiency evaluation
   - Biennial well inspection and cleaning

3. **System Integration:**
   - Coordinate operation with existing Wells A, B, C, D, E, and F
   - Install telemetry for remote monitoring
   - Develop emergency shutdown procedures

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The well location provides access to a highly productive aquifer that extends throughout the eastern portion of Woburn. Groundwater flow direction is generally south-southeast toward the Mystic River system. The aquifer shows good natural filtration characteristics through the sand and gravel formation.

**Potential Contamination Sources Identified:**
- Industrial facilities located upgradient to the north
- Former dump areas reported in vicinity (locations to be surveyed)
- Surface water interaction with Aberjona River during high flow periods

## CERTIFICATION

I hereby certify that Well G has been drilled and constructed in accordance with the specifications provided by the City of Woburn and applicable state regulations. The well is capable of producing high-quality water at the specified capacity and is ready for integration into the municipal water supply system.
