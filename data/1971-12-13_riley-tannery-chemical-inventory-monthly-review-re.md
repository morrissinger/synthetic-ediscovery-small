# MONTHLY CHEMICAL INVENTORY REVIEW REPORT

**TO:** Plant Supervisor  
**FROM:** Operations Manager, Riley Tannery Division  
**DATE:** December 13, 1971  
**RE:** November 1971 Chemical Inventory and Usage Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive review of chemical inventory levels, usage patterns, and disposal activities at the Riley Tannery facility for the month of November 1971.

## Disposal Activities

### Liquid Waste Management

During November 1971, the following liquid waste disposal activities were conducted:

**November 3, 1971:** Disposed of 85 gallons of spent TCE/water mixture and 45 gallons of chromium-contaminated wastewater via on-site disposal pit located in rear yard area, approximately 150 feet southeast of main building complex.

**November 10, 1971:** Disposed of 120 gallons of mixed solvent waste (primarily TCE and PCE residuals) and 60 gallons of lime-sulfide wastewater via on-site disposal pit.

**November 17, 1971:** Disposed of 95 gallons of spent degreasing solvents and 75 gallons of process wastewater containing chromium and sulfide compounds via on-site disposal pit.

**November 24, 1971:** Disposed of 110 gallons of mixed chemical waste including spent solvents and 80 gallons of tanning process wastewater via on-site disposal pit.

*Total liquid waste disposed: 670 gallons*

### Solid Waste Management

Solid chemical waste including empty containers, contaminated rags, and spent lime materials were collected by Suburban Waste Services on November 16, 1971. Total solid waste removed: approximately 1,200 lbs.

## Storage and Safety Observations

### Storage Capacity

Current chemical storage capacity is operating at approximately 78% of maximum safe capacity. The chemical storage room in Building B requires ventilation system maintenance, as noted in previous reports. Recommend scheduling this maintenance for December 1971 to ensure continued safe storage of volatile solvents.

### Container Integrity

Routine inspection of storage containers revealed minor corrosion on three 55-gallon TCE drums (Serial numbers: TC-441, TC-442, TC-447). These containers remain serviceable but should be monitored closely and replaced within 60 days.

### Disposal Pit Conditions

The on-site disposal pit continues to provide adequate capacity for liquid waste disposal. Current pit depth measures approximately 12 feet with good drainage characteristics. No issues with pit capacity or function noted during November operations.

## Procurement Requirements

### Immediate Needs (December 1971)

- Chromium Sulfate: 1,500 lbs (recommend order by December 20)
- Sodium Sulfide: 800 lbs (recommend order by December 22)
- TCE: 250 gallons (recommend order by December 18)
- PCE: 150 gallons (recommend order by December 20)

### Supplier Performance

Whitmore Chemical Supply continued to provide reliable delivery service with all November orders received within specified timeframes. Pricing remains competitive with 1971 contract terms.

## Regulatory Compliance

All chemical storage and handling activities during November 1971 were conducted in accordance with current Massachusetts Department of Public Safety guidelines for industrial chemical facilities. No reportable incidents or violations occurred during the reporting period.

Disposal activities continue to follow established company protocols for on-site waste management. The disposal pit system provides cost-effective waste management while maintaining compliance with applicable local ordinances.

## Recommendations

1. **Maintenance Priority:** Schedule ventilation system service for Building B chemical storage room during December shutdown period.

2. **Container Replacement:** Order three replacement 55-gallon drums for TCE storage to replace corroded units identified in inspection.

3. **Inventory Management:** Consider increasing TCE safety stock levels by 50 gallons to account for increased degreasing operations expected in Q1 1972.

4. **Disposal Efficiency:** Continue current on-site disposal practices which have proven both cost-effective and operationally efficient.

## Conclusion

November 1971 operations proceeded smoothly with adequate chemical supplies maintained throughout the month. Current inventory management and disposal practices continue to meet operational requirements while maintaining cost efficiency. The on-site disposal system continues to provide reliable waste management capability for our tanning operations.

All chemical handling and disposal activities were conducted in accordance with established company procedures and applicable regulations. No safety incidents or compliance issues were identified during the reporting period.
