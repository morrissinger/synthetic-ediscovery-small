# INTERNAL MEMORANDUM

**TO:** W.R. Grace Environmental Department  
**FROM:** David Patterson, Operations Manager  
**DATE:** February 15, 1970  
**RE:** Internal Environmental Compliance Assessment - Q1 1970 Quarterly Review

## Executive Summary

This memorandum provides our quarterly assessment of environmental compliance activities at the Woburn facility for the period ending December 31, 1969, with preliminary observations for ongoing operations through February 1970. Overall facility operations continue to meet current production targets while maintaining adherence to existing regulatory frameworks. Several operational adjustments have been implemented to address routine maintenance and disposal protocols.

## Waste Management Operations Review

Our current waste management protocols remain consistent with established industrial practices for chemical manufacturing facilities. Solvent recovery operations have been optimized to reduce material costs, with recovered TCE and other chlorinated solvents being recycled back into production processes where feasible. Non-recoverable chemical waste continues to be managed through approved disposal methods, including on-site treatment and approved contractor services.

The facility's waste disposal areas have been inspected and found to be operating within normal parameters. Drainage systems are functioning as designed, and we have observed no unusual conditions that would warrant immediate operational changes. Our maintenance staff continues to monitor these systems on a routine basis as part of standard operating procedures.

## Regulatory Compliance Status

Current operations remain in compliance with applicable state and federal regulations governing chemical manufacturing facilities. We have maintained all required documentation and reporting as specified by relevant authorities. No regulatory inspections were conducted during the reporting period, and we have received no notices of violation or requests for additional information from regulatory agencies.

The facility continues to operate under existing permits and authorizations. All required notifications have been submitted according to established schedules, and we anticipate no changes to our regulatory status in the immediate term.

## Operational Recommendations

Based on this quarterly review, I recommend continued adherence to existing protocols while maintaining vigilance regarding any changes to regulatory requirements that may affect our operations. Our current waste management and disposal practices represent industry-standard approaches that balance operational efficiency with regulatory compliance.

We should continue monitoring developments in environmental regulations at both state and federal levels to ensure timely implementation of any new requirements. The Environmental Department should maintain regular communication with facility management regarding any potential changes that could affect our operational protocols.
