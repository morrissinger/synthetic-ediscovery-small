## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of routine water quality testing conducted on municipal Wells G and H during the period of March 15 through April 10, 1971. Wells G and H, commissioned in 1964 and 1966 respectively, serve as supplemental water sources for the eastern districts of Woburn, providing domestic water supply to approximately 2,400 residential connections when operational.

Testing was conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations and federal guidelines for municipal water systems. All samples were collected by certified personnel and analyzed at the Woburn Water Department laboratory facility using standard analytical methods.

## WELL SPECIFICATIONS AND OPERATIONAL STATUS

**Well G:**
- Location: Lot 47, Industrial Avenue
- Depth: 88 feet
- Casing: 12-inch steel to 78 feet, open hole to total depth
- Pump capacity: 400 gallons per minute
- Commission date: September 1964
- Operational status: Active (intermittent use)

**Well H:**  
- Location: Lot 49, Industrial Avenue
- Depth: 90 feet
- Casing: 12-inch steel to 80 feet, open hole to total depth
- Pump capacity: 450 gallons per minute
- Commission date: March 1966
- Operational status: Active (intermittent use)

Both wells draw from the Aberjona River watershed aquifer system and are positioned approximately 150 feet apart in the bedrock trench formation that constitutes the deepest section of the local groundwater basin.

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected from each well on March 15, March 22, March 29, and April 5, 1971, during normal operational periods. Samples were drawn directly from the wellhead after a minimum 10-minute pump operation to ensure representative groundwater quality. All collection procedures followed standard protocols established by the American Water Works Association.

Laboratory analysis included the following parameters:
- Bacteriological examination (coliform count)
- Physical characteristics (color, turbidity, odor, taste)
- Chemical analysis (pH, hardness, iron, manganese, chloride, sulfate)
- Heavy metals screening (lead, copper, zinc)

| Turbidity (JTU) | 2.1 | 3.4 | <10 acceptable |
| Odor | None | Slight chemical | None preferred |
| Taste | None | Slight metallic | None preferred |

### Chemical Analysis (Average Values)
| Parameter | Well G | Well H | Recommended Limit |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| pH | 6.8 | 6.5 | 6.5-8.5 |
| Total Hardness (ppm CaCO3) | 180 | 195 | <300 |

| Manganese (ppm) | 0.08 | 0.12 | <0.05 |
| Chloride (ppm) | 45 | 52 | <250 |
| Sulfate (ppm) | 78 | 89 | <250 |

### Heavy Metals Analysis
| Parameter | Well G | Well H | Maximum Allowable |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Lead (ppm) | <0.01 | <0.01 | 0.05 |
| Copper (ppm) | 0.02 | 0.03 | 1.0 |
| Zinc (ppm) | 0.08 | 0.11 | 5.0 |

## FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS

The bacteriological analysis indicates that both wells continue to produce water free from harmful bacterial contamination, with coliform counts consistently below detectable limits. This suggests adequate natural filtration through the aquifer system and absence of direct surface contamination pathways.

Physical characteristics of water from Well G remain within acceptable parameters. However, Well H exhibits slight but noticeable organoleptic properties, including a faint chemical odor and metallic taste that have been intermittently reported by field personnel during routine sampling operations. These characteristics do not exceed regulatory thresholds but warrant continued monitoring.

Chemical analysis reveals water quality generally consistent with previous testing periods. Both wells produce moderately hard water typical of the regional groundwater system. Iron and manganese concentrations in Well H approach the upper limits of recommended levels, which may contribute to the observed taste and odor characteristics.

Manganese levels in Well H (0.12 ppm) exceed the recommended aesthetic guideline of 0.05 ppm, though they remain below health-based standards. Elevated manganese can contribute to metallic taste and may cause staining of plumbing fixtures in the distribution system.

Heavy metals analysis indicates concentrations well below maximum allowable limits for all tested parameters. The slightly elevated copper and zinc levels in Well H, while remaining within acceptable ranges, show a marginal increase compared to historical data.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Continued Monitoring:** Maintain current monthly sampling schedule for both wells, with particular attention to organoleptic properties of Well H water.

2. **Manganese Treatment:** Consider installation of manganese removal equipment for Well H if taste and odor complaints increase from residential customers in the eastern district service area.

3. **Source Investigation:** Conduct periodic inspection of well sites and surrounding areas to identify any potential sources of contamination that might affect groundwater quality.

4. **Distribution System Maintenance:** Implement regular flushing of distribution lines serving areas supplied by Wells G and H to prevent accumulation of iron and manganese precipitates.

5. **Customer Communication:** Establish protocol for documenting and investigating any customer complaints regarding water taste, odor, or appearance in areas served by these wells.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Water quality from both Wells G and H meets all applicable standards established by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and federal drinking water regulations current as of April 1971. Bacteriological safety requirements are fully satisfied, and chemical parameters remain within acceptable limits for public consumption.

This report will be filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in accordance with regulatory reporting requirements and maintained in the Woburn Water Department records.
