## CONVERSATION TRANSCRIPT (Abbreviated)

**Dr. Hendricks:** "Mrs. Toomey, this is Dr. Patricia Hendricks calling from the laboratory at Woburn General Hospital. I need to speak with you about Patrick's blood test results from last Friday."

**Mrs. Toomey:** "Yes, doctor. Is everything alright? Patrick has been so tired lately, and those nosebleeds..."

**Dr. Hendricks:** "Mrs. Toomey, I need you to listen carefully. Patrick's blood work shows some concerning abnormalities that require immediate medical attention. His white blood cell count is significantly elevated at 47,000 cells per microliter - normal range for his age should be between 5,000 and 15,000."

**Mrs. Toomey:** [Inaudible response - voice distressed]

**Dr. Hendricks:** "Additionally, his platelet count is dangerously low at 18,000 per microliter, which explains the bruising and nosebleeds you've noticed. Normal levels should be above 150,000. His red blood cell count is also below normal parameters."

**Mrs. Toomey:** "What does this mean, doctor? Is Patrick... is he going to be okay?"

**Dr. Hendricks:** "Mrs. Toomey, these results suggest a serious blood disorder that needs immediate evaluation by a pediatric hematologist. I've already contacted Dr. Margaret Walsh at Children's Hospital Boston, and she can see Patrick tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. This cannot wait."

**Mrs. Toomey:** "Oh my God... doctor, there are other children in our neighborhood who have been sick too. The Kane boy, and little Michael Zona... could this be connected somehow?"

**Dr. Hendricks:** "I understand your concern, Mrs. Toomey. Right now, our focus needs to be on Patrick's immediate care. Dr. Walsh will conduct additional tests including a bone marrow biopsy to determine the exact nature of his condition. Have you noticed any other symptoms - fever, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes?"

**Mrs. Toomey:** "He's lost about eight pounds in the past month, and yes, there are swollen glands in his neck. Doctor, I'm scared. What are you thinking this might be?"

**Dr. Hendricks:** "Mrs. Toomey, I don't want to speculate until we have more definitive results. However, given the combination of elevated white cells, low platelets, and the symptoms you've described, Dr. Walsh will need to rule out several serious conditions, including leukemia."

**Mrs. Toomey:** [Long pause, crying] "Leukemia? But he's only nine years old..."

**Dr. Hendricks:** "I know this is terrifying news. Please remember that early detection and treatment have improved outcomes significantly. Dr. Walsh is one of the best pediatric hematologists in New England. I'm also arranging for copies of all Patrick's lab work to be sent to Children's Hospital tonight."

**Mrs. Toomey:** "Should I tell Patrick? What do I say to him?"

**Dr. Hendricks:** "For now, simply tell him that the doctors want to do some more tests to help him feel better. Dr. Walsh will guide you on how to discuss this with Patrick once we have a clearer picture. Do you have transportation to Boston tomorrow morning?"

**Mrs. Toomey:** "Yes, my husband can drive us. Doctor, you mentioned other children in the neighborhood... should I be worried about my other kids too?"

**Dr. Hendricks:** "If you have concerns about your other children, please schedule appointments for them as well. Given what you've mentioned about neighborhood children, it might be worth discussing with Dr. Chen whether additional testing is warranted."
