# Follow-up Letter to DPH Regarding Delayed Response to Health Concerns

September 18, 1979

Massachusetts Department of Public Health

Dear Dr. Phillips,

I am writing to follow up on my previous correspondence dated August 15th regarding the alarming pattern of childhood illnesses in our East Woburn neighborhood, particularly in the Pine Street area. As I have not yet received a substantive response to my concerns, I feel compelled to write again with additional information that has come to light since the closure of Wells G and H in May.

As you may recall from my earlier letter, my son Jimmy was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in January 1973 at the age of three. At that time, we were told this was an isolated case—a terrible stroke of bad luck that could happen to any family. However, over the past several months, I have been in contact with other families in our immediate area who have experienced similar tragedies. The Kane family on Pine Street lost their son Kevin Jr. to leukemia in 1978. The Zona family, also on Pine Street, has been battling their son Michael's leukemia diagnosis since 1976. Mrs. Toomey has shared with me that her son Patrick was diagnosed with the same disease in 1975. These are not distant neighbors—these are families within a few blocks of each other, all of whom have been served by the same water supply from Wells G and H.

When the wells were closed in May due to chemical contamination, many of us began to wonder if there might be a connection between the water we had been drinking for years and these devastating illnesses affecting our children. I have been researching what I can about the chemicals found in our water supply—trichloroethylene and other industrial solvents—and while I am not a scientist, the timing seems more than coincidental. These wells served our neighborhood from 1964 until this past May, and virtually all of the affected children were born and raised drinking this water during their most vulnerable developmental years.

I understand that the Department of Public Health has a duty to protect the health and welfare of Massachusetts citizens, particularly when there are reasonable grounds to suspect environmental factors may be contributing to disease patterns. The closure of Wells G and H demonstrates that the state recognized the water supply posed a health risk serious enough to warrant immediate action. What I cannot understand is why there has been no follow-up investigation into whether this contaminated water supply may have contributed to the cluster of childhood leukemia cases in our community.

The families I have spoken with are not looking to place blame or create panic in our community. We simply want to know if our children's illnesses could have been prevented, and whether other families might be at risk. We deserve answers about what chemicals our children were exposed to, for how long, and what the potential health consequences might be. More importantly, if there is a connection between the contaminated wells and these leukemia cases, the Department has a responsibility to conduct a thorough health study to determine the scope of the problem and prevent further harm.

I have attempted to gather information about the companies responsible for the contamination—W.R. Grace and their Cryovac operation, as well as the tannery operations in the area—but as a concerned mother without scientific training or legal resources, I can only do so much. The Department of Public Health has the expertise, authority, and resources to conduct a proper investigation into both the source of the contamination and its potential health effects on our community.

The children affected by leukemia in our neighborhood have endured years of painful treatments, hospitalizations, and in some cases, death. Their families have suffered emotionally and financially in ways that are difficult to describe. If these tragedies could have been prevented through proper oversight of industrial waste disposal or earlier testing of our water supply, then we have been failed by the very agencies entrusted with protecting public health. If there is no connection, then a proper study would provide peace of mind to families who continue to live with fear and uncertainty.

I am requesting that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health initiate a comprehensive health study of childhood cancer rates in the East Woburn area, with particular attention to the neighborhoods served by Wells G and H during their operational period from 1964 to 1979. Such a study should examine not only the incidence of leukemia but also other cancers and health problems that might be related to long-term exposure to the chemicals found in our water supply. Additionally, I believe the Department should work with other state and federal agencies to ensure that the companies responsible for contaminating our water supply are held accountable for their actions.

Our children deserved better protection than they received. The least we can do now is ensure that we have a complete understanding of what happened and take steps to prevent similar tragedies in other communities. I hope that you will give this matter the urgent attention it deserves and respond with concrete steps the Department plans to take to address our concerns.

I look forward to your prompt response and to working with the Department to protect the health of our community.

Sincerely,
