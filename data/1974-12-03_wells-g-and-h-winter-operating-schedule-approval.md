# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Charles J. Murphy, Water Department Superintendent  
**FROM:** Robert F. Manning, Chairman, Woburn Water Commission  
**DATE:** December 3, 1974  
**RE:** Wells G and H Winter Operating Schedule Approval

Charlie,

Following our discussion at yesterday's commission meeting, I am formally authorizing the continuation of Wells G and H operations through the winter months of 1975 under the modified pumping schedule you proposed. Given the increased municipal demand and the reliability issues we've experienced with our older wells this fall, maintaining G and H at full capacity remains essential for meeting our service obligations to the East Woburn residential areas.

Your recommendation to increase pumping hours from 16 to 20 hours daily during peak winter demand periods is approved, effective December 15, 1974. This adjustment should provide adequate supply margin while allowing for routine maintenance on Wells 1 and 3, which have shown declining output since October. The Department of Public Health has confirmed that our current water quality testing protocols remain sufficient for continued operation, and our most recent bacterial samples from both wells came back within acceptable parameters.

I want to emphasize the importance of maintaining consistent monitoring during this increased operation period. While we have not encountered any significant quality issues with G and H since they came online, the commission recognizes our responsibility to ensure safe water delivery to all Woburn residents. Please continue the monthly sampling schedule and immediately report any anomalies in taste, odor, or appearance. The residents in the Montvale Road, Salem Street, and surrounding East Woburn neighborhoods have come to rely on the consistent service these wells provide, and we must maintain their confidence in our municipal supply.

Additionally, please coordinate with Public Works to ensure adequate road maintenance around the well sites during winter weather. The access roads to both facilities need to remain passable for emergency service and routine inspections. I've spoken with Director Thompson about snow removal priorities, and both well sites are included in the primary route schedule.

The commission will review this operating schedule again in March 1975 to assess winter performance and plan for spring maintenance activities. Please prepare a summary report of pumping volumes, maintenance requirements, and any operational issues by March 15th for our quarterly review.

Thank you for your continued diligence in managing our water supply operations. The commission has full confidence in your department's ability to maintain safe and reliable service throughout the winter season.
