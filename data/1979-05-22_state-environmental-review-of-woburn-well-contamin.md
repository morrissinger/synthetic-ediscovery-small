# STATE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF WOBURN WELL CONTAMINATION

**TECHNICAL REPORT NO. DEP-79-WS-157**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the findings of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection's investigation into volatile organic compound contamination discovered in municipal Wells G and H serving East Woburn. Testing conducted between May 15-20, 1979, has revealed significant concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE) and other industrial solvents exceeding acceptable limits for public water supply. The contamination appears to originate from industrial facilities operating within the Aberjona River Valley watershed, specifically properties associated with W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc. and Beatrice Foods/John J. Riley Company operations.

Immediate closure of both wells is recommended pending comprehensive remedial action and alternative water supply arrangements for affected neighborhoods. This contamination represents a serious public health concern requiring coordinated response between state environmental and health agencies.

## BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY

### Site Description

Municipal Wells G and H are located in East Woburn, Massachusetts, approximately 0.5 miles northeast of the city center within the Aberjona River Valley glacial outwash plain. Well G commenced operation in 1964, followed by Well H in 1966, as supplemental sources to meet growing municipal water demand. Combined, these wells have provided approximately 2.5 million gallons per day to residential areas of East Woburn, serving an estimated population of 8,000-10,000 residents.

The wells draw from an unconfined aquifer consisting of sand and gravel deposits extending 40-60 feet below ground surface. Groundwater flow direction is generally southeast toward the Aberjona River, with estimated flow velocities of 0.5-1.0 feet per day based on hydraulic conductivity measurements.

### Industrial Context

Two major industrial facilities operate within the groundwater recharge zone upgradient from Wells G and H:

1. **W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Division** - Located at 369 Washington Street, approximately 1,200 feet northeast of Well G. This facility manufactures packaging machinery and food packaging materials, utilizing trichloroethylene and other chlorinated solvents in degreasing and cleaning operations. The 52-acre property includes manufacturing buildings, storage areas, and waste disposal areas.

2. **Beatrice Foods/John J. Riley Company** - Located at 228 Salem Street, approximately 800 feet southwest of Well H. This leather tanning operation processes animal hides using various chemicals including chromium compounds and organic solvents. The facility includes tanning vats, chemical storage tanks, and a 14.73-acre undeveloped area used historically for waste disposal.

### Testing Methodology

Water samples were collected from Wells G and H on May 15, 17, and 19, 1979, using standard EPA protocols for volatile organic compound analysis. Samples were preserved with hydrochloric acid and maintained at 4°C during transport to the state laboratory. Analysis was performed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with detection limits of 1.0 parts per billion (ppb) for target compounds.

Quality assurance measures included duplicate samples, field blanks, and certified reference standards. Chain of custody procedures were maintained throughout sample collection and analysis.

## FINDINGS

### Contamination Levels

Laboratory analysis has confirmed the presence of multiple volatile organic compounds in both wells at concentrations significantly exceeding recommended limits:

**Well G Results:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 267 ppb (average of three samples)
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 21 ppb
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 8 ppb
- Chloroform: 3 ppb

**Well H Results:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 183 ppb (average of three samples)
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 15 ppb
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 12 ppb
- Chloroform: 5 ppb

For comparison, the EPA's proposed maximum contaminant level for trichloroethylene in drinking water is 50 ppb. Both wells exceed this standard by factors of 3.7 to 5.3.

### Source Assessment

The pattern and concentration of contamination strongly suggests multiple source areas within the local groundwater system. Trichloroethylene, the predominant contaminant, is commonly used in industrial degreasing operations and is known to be utilized at the W.R. Grace/Cryovac facility. Site reconnaissance conducted May 18-19, 1979, identified several potential source areas:

1. **Grace/Cryovac Property**: Observed surface staining and chemical odors in areas behind the main manufacturing building. Waste disposal practices appear to have included direct discharge to unlined lagoons and burial of containerized waste materials.

2. **Riley Tannery Property**: Evidence of historical waste disposal on the undeveloped 14.73-acre parcel, including buried drums and surface contamination. Groundwater monitoring wells installed in 1978 showed elevated organic compound levels.

3. **Additional Sources**: Other smaller industrial operations in the area may have contributed to the contamination plume, though the Grace and Riley properties represent the most significant potential sources based on chemical usage patterns and proximity to the wells.

### Hydrogeological Assessment

Groundwater flow modeling indicates that contaminant transport from the identified source areas to Wells G and H is consistent with observed contamination patterns. Travel times from the Grace property to Well G are estimated at 2-4 years, while transport from the Riley property to Well H would require 1-3 years under average flow conditions.

The permeable nature of the glacial outwash aquifer facilitates rapid contaminant migration with minimal natural attenuation. Chlorinated solvents are particularly persistent in groundwater systems and may remain mobile for decades without active remediation.

## PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS

The presence of chlorinated organic solvents in public drinking water supplies poses serious health risks to exposed populations. Trichloroethylene is classified as a probable human carcinogen and has been associated with liver toxicity, central nervous system effects, and reproductive disorders in laboratory studies.

Residents served by Wells G and H have potentially been exposed to contaminated water since the wells began operation in 1964 and 1966. The full extent of health impacts cannot be determined without comprehensive epidemiological investigation, but the concentration levels detected warrant immediate precautionary measures.

Of particular concern are vulnerable populations including pregnant women, infants, and children, who may be more susceptible to adverse health effects from chemical exposure. The Department recommends immediate coordination with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to assess potential health impacts and implement appropriate medical surveillance programs.

## REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

The contamination of Wells G and H represents violations of both state and federal drinking water standards. Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 160, the Department has authority to order immediate closure of contaminated public water supplies. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act provisions also require prompt notification of consumers when contamination exceeds maximum allowable levels.

Industrial facilities identified as potential contamination sources may be subject to enforcement action under state environmental protection statutes. The Department will coordinate with the Attorney General's Office to evaluate potential legal remedies and ensure responsible parties bear the costs of remediation and alternative water supply provision.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Within 30 Days)

1. **Well Closure**: Issue emergency order closing Wells G and H to public water supply effective immediately.

2. **Alternative Water Supply**: Coordinate with Woburn Water Department to increase pumping from uncontaminated wells and establish emergency interconnections with neighboring water systems.

3. **Public Notification**: Issue public advisory to residents served by the contaminated wells, including recommendations for alternative water sources and health precautions.

4. **Health Assessment**: Initiate coordination with Department of Public Health for epidemiological investigation and medical surveillance programs.

### Short-Term Actions (30-90 Days)

1. **Expanded Testing**: Conduct comprehensive sampling of all municipal wells and private wells within a two-mile radius of the contaminated wells.

2. **Source Investigation**: Perform detailed environmental assessment of identified industrial properties, including soil and groundwater sampling to delineate contamination extent.
