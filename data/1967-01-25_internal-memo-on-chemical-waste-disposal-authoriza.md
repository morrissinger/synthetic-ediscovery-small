# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Plant Operations Staff  
**FROM:** Robert H. Mitchell, Facility Manager  
**DATE:** January 25, 1967  
**RE:** Authorization for Chemical Waste Disposal - East Woburn Facility

## Disposal Authorization and Procedures

Effective immediately, all plant operations staff are authorized to proceed with the disposal of accumulated chemical solvents and production waste materials according to the procedures outlined below. This authorization comes following our recent facility capacity assessment and the need to maintain operational efficiency during our expanded production schedule for the first quarter of 1967.

The primary disposal area has been designated as the eastern section of our property, approximately 300 yards from the main production building, in the low-lying area adjacent to the tree line. This location provides adequate drainage and is positioned to minimize any potential interference with our manufacturing operations. Disposal activities should be conducted during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM, to ensure proper supervision and documentation.

## Approved Materials and Volumes

The following materials are approved for disposal under this authorization: trichloroethylene (TCE) cleaning solvents from our degreasing operations, perchloroethylene (PCE) from our dry cleaning equipment maintenance, and various industrial adhesives and coating materials used in our packaging operations. Estimated disposal volumes are projected at approximately 200-300 gallons per month, consistent with our current production levels and cleaning requirements. All materials should be transported to the disposal area using the designated wheeled containers, and staff should ensure that disposal activities do not interfere with the normal flow of operations or create safety hazards for personnel.

## Documentation and Reporting

Plant supervisors are responsible for maintaining basic records of disposal activities, including approximate dates, types of materials, and estimated quantities. These records should be kept in the operations logbook and made available for review during monthly facility inspections. While detailed documentation is not required for routine disposal activities, any unusual circumstances or larger-than-normal disposal volumes should be reported to facility management within 24 hours.

## Safety and Operational Considerations

All disposal activities must be conducted in accordance with standard plant safety procedures. Personnel involved in waste handling should use appropriate protective equipment, including rubber gloves and safety glasses, when handling chemical materials. The disposal area should be kept clear of unnecessary personnel during active disposal operations, and proper ventilation considerations should be observed when working with volatile solvents. Any spills or accidents during disposal activities should be reported immediately to the shift supervisor and documented in the incident log.

This authorization remains in effect until further notice and may be modified based on changes in production requirements or facility operations. Questions regarding these procedures should be directed to facility management or the plant operations supervisor.
