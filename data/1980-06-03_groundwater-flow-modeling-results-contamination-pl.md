## ABSTRACT

This technical report presents the results of groundwater flow modeling and contamination plume analysis for the East Woburn municipal Wells G and H contamination incident. Computer modeling utilizing the finite difference method was employed to map the extent and movement of volatile organic compound contamination within the Aberjona River Valley aquifer system. Results indicate multiple source areas contributing to a complex contamination plume that directly impacted Wells G and H during their operational period from 1964-1979. Trichloroethylene concentrations exceeding 267 parts per billion were detected in well samples, representing contamination levels approximately 100 times above background conditions.

## INTRODUCTION

Following the closure of municipal Wells G and H in May 1979 due to detection of volatile organic compounds, the EPA Hydrogeology Division was tasked with conducting comprehensive groundwater flow modeling to determine the source, extent, and temporal development of contamination within the local aquifer system. This analysis supports ongoing environmental assessment activities and provides technical foundation for regulatory enforcement actions.

The study area encompasses approximately 2.5 square miles within the Aberjona River Valley in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Two municipal water supply wells (Wells G and H) operated within this area from 1964 and 1966 respectively until closure in May 1979. Multiple industrial facilities with documented histories of solvent use and waste disposal practices are located upgradient from the well locations.

## METHODOLOGY

### Hydrogeological Characterization

Field investigation activities included installation of 24 monitoring wells arranged in a grid pattern extending from identified potential source areas to Wells G and H. Monitoring wells were constructed using 6-inch diameter PVC casing with 10-foot screened intervals positioned within the primary aquifer zone. Water level measurements were recorded bi-weekly from March through May 1980 to establish groundwater flow patterns.

Aquifer testing was conducted using constant-rate pumping tests at three locations to determine hydraulic conductivity values. Slug tests were performed at all monitoring well locations to assess local permeability variations. Grain size analysis of aquifer materials was conducted on split-spoon samples collected during drilling operations.

### Computer Modeling

A two-dimensional finite difference groundwater flow model was constructed using a 50-foot grid spacing over the study area. The model incorporated measured hydraulic conductivity values, observed water levels, and known pumping rates from Wells G and H during their operational period. Boundary conditions were established based on regional groundwater flow patterns and surface water interactions with the Aberjona River.

Contaminant transport modeling employed particle tracking methods to simulate the movement of conservative tracers from identified source areas. Multiple scenarios were evaluated to assess the influence of different source locations and release timing on contamination arrival at Wells G and H.

## RESULTS

### Groundwater Flow Patterns

Modeling results indicate that groundwater flow within the study area follows a generally southeast direction toward the Aberjona River, with local flow modifications induced by pumping at Wells G and H. During periods of well operation, capture zones extended approximately 1,200 feet upgradient from Well G and 800 feet upgradient from Well H.

Hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 8.2 × 10⁻⁴ to 3.1 × 10⁻³ cm/sec, with higher permeability zones associated with coarser glacial outwash deposits. A lower permeability clay layer at depths of 25-35 feet below ground surface creates semi-confined conditions in portions of the aquifer.

### Contamination Source Analysis

Particle tracking analysis identified two primary source areas capable of contributing contamination to Wells G and H:

**Source Area 1:** Located northeast of Wells G and H, encompassing the W.R. Grace/Cryovac facility at 369 Washington Street. Particles released from this area reach Well G in approximately 2.1 years and Well H in 3.4 years under average flow conditions.

**Source Area 2:** Located southwest of the wells, encompassing the Beatrice Foods/Riley Tannery property at 228 Salem Street and adjacent undeveloped areas. Transport times from this source area range from 4.2 to 6.8 years to reach the well locations.

### Contaminant Distribution

Chemical analysis of monitoring well samples reveals a complex contamination plume extending from both identified source areas toward Wells G and H. Maximum trichloroethylene concentrations of 1,840 μg/L were detected in monitoring well MW-12, located approximately 400 feet downgradient from the Grace facility.

The contamination plume exhibits irregular boundaries consistent with preferential flow paths through higher permeability zones. Vertical distribution of contamination shows highest concentrations in the upper portion of the aquifer, with some migration to deeper zones in areas of enhanced vertical flow.

## DISCUSSION

The groundwater flow modeling results demonstrate that contamination detected in Wells G and H originated from industrial activities at multiple upgradient locations. The spatial distribution and chemical signature of contamination is consistent with release of chlorinated solvents used in manufacturing operations at both the Grace/Cryovac facility and the Riley Tannery complex.

Transport modeling indicates that contamination from the Grace facility would have reached Wells G and H by approximately 1966-1967, while contamination from the southwestern source area would have arrived by 1970-1973. This timing is consistent with the operational history of Wells G and H, which began pumping in 1964 and 1966 respectively.

The irregular shape of the contamination plume reflects the complex hydrogeology of the glacial deposits that comprise the local aquifer system. Preferential flow paths through coarser materials have created finger-like extensions of contamination that directly impacted the well capture zones.

## CONCLUSIONS

Based on the groundwater flow modeling and contamination analysis conducted, the following conclusions are supported:

1. **Multiple Source Contribution**: Contamination detected in Wells G and H originated from at least two distinct source areas, with the Grace/Cryovac facility contributing the primary contamination load.

2. **Historical Timeline**: Contamination release likely began in the early 1960s, with arrival at Wells G and H occurring within 2-7 years of initial release depending on source location.

3. **Extent of Impact**: The contamination plume covers approximately 0.8 square miles and has impacted groundwater quality throughout the eastern portion of the Aberjona Valley aquifer system.

4. **Continued Migration**: Modeling results indicate that contamination continues to migrate toward the Aberjona River, with potential for ongoing environmental impact.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Extended Monitoring**: Implementation of long-term groundwater monitoring program to track contamination migration and assess natural attenuation processes.

2. **Source Control**: Immediate investigation and remediation of identified source areas to prevent continued contamination release.

3. **Water Supply Protection
