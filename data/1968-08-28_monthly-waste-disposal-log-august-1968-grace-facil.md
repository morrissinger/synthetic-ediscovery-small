# MONTHLY WASTE DISPOSAL LOG
## W.R. GRACE COMPANY - WOBURN FACILITY
### AUGUST 1968

**TO:** Environmental Compliance Officer  
**FROM:** Robert P. Matthews, Facilities Supervisor  
**DATE:** August 28, 1968  
**RE:** Monthly Waste Disposal Activities - August 1968

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents waste disposal activities conducted at the W.R. Grace Company Woburn facility during the month of August 1968. The facility continued standard operations for the disposal of manufacturing byproducts and chemical waste materials generated from our Cryovac division operations and related chemical processing activities. All disposal activities were conducted in accordance with established company protocols and available regulatory guidance.

## FACILITY OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

The Woburn facility maintained normal production schedules throughout August, with our primary manufacturing operations focused on chemical processing for the Cryovac division. The facility processed approximately 2,400 tons of raw materials during the reporting period, generating corresponding waste streams requiring proper disposal management.

Our waste management operations continued to utilize the established disposal areas on the eastern portion of the property, adjacent to the Aberjona River corridor. These areas have proven effective for containing and managing industrial byproducts while maintaining operational efficiency for our manufacturing processes.

## WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

### Chemical Solvent Disposal

During August 1968, the facility disposed of the following chemical solvents and related materials:

**Trichloroethylene (TCE):**
- Total volume disposed: 1,850 gallons
- Method: Direct application to designated disposal areas
- Disposal dates: August 3, 10, 17, 24, 31
- Source: Degreasing operations and equipment cleaning

**Tetrachloroethylene (PCE):**
- Total volume disposed: 1,220 gallons
- Method: Direct application to designated disposal areas
- Disposal dates: August 7, 14, 21, 28
- Source: Chemical processing and cleaning operations

**Mixed Solvent Waste:**
- Total volume disposed: 890 gallons
- Composition: Various chlorinated compounds and cleaning agents
- Method: Direct application to designated disposal areas
- Disposal dates: August 5, 12, 19, 26

### Solid Waste Materials

The facility disposed of approximately 45 tons of solid waste materials during August, including:
- Contaminated packaging materials: 18 tons
- Process residues and sludges: 15 tons
- Equipment maintenance waste: 8 tons
- General facility waste: 4 tons

All solid waste materials were deposited in the designated disposal areas using standard earth-moving equipment. Materials were covered with available soil and gravel as conditions permitted.

### Liquid Waste Streams

Non-solvent liquid wastes totaling approximately 12,000 gallons were disposed of during the reporting period. These materials included:
- Process water from manufacturing operations
- Equipment rinse water
- Facility washdown water
- Laboratory waste liquids

Liquid wastes were directed to the established lagoon system and overflow areas on the eastern portion of the property.

## DISPOSAL AREA CONDITIONS

The primary disposal areas on the eastern section of the property continued to accommodate waste materials effectively during August. The areas showed normal settling and absorption characteristics, with no unusual conditions observed during routine inspections.

Ground conditions remained suitable for disposal operations throughout the month, with adequate capacity for continued use. The proximity to the Aberjona River provides natural drainage characteristics that assist in the management of liquid waste streams.

Weather conditions during August were generally favorable for disposal operations, with normal precipitation levels and temperatures conducive to the natural processing of waste materials.

## REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

The facility maintained compliance with applicable local regulations regarding waste disposal activities. No specific federal regulations currently govern our disposal methods, and we continue to follow established industry practices for the management of chemical waste streams.

Communications with local authorities remained routine during August, with no special inquiries or concerns raised regarding our disposal activities. The facility's operations continue to support the local economy while managing industrial byproducts in a practical and cost-effective manner.

## OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY

Disposal operations during August demonstrated continued efficiency in managing waste streams generated by our manufacturing processes. The established disposal areas provide adequate capacity for current production levels, and disposal methods remain cost-effective for company operations.

Transportation and handling of waste materials proceeded smoothly throughout the month, with no significant operational disruptions or equipment failures affecting disposal activities.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on August operations, I recommend the following for continued effective waste management:

1. **Maintain Current Disposal Protocols:** The established disposal methods continue to provide effective management of waste streams while supporting operational efficiency.

2. **Monitor Disposal Area Capacity:** While current areas remain adequate, continued monitoring will ensure sufficient capacity for future operations.

3. **Equipment Maintenance:** Regular maintenance of earth-moving and handling equipment will ensure continued operational reliability.

4. **Weather Contingency Planning:** Develop procedures for managing disposal operations during adverse weather conditions, particularly during winter months.

## CONCLUSION

Waste disposal operations during August 1968 proceeded according to established protocols and company standards. The facility successfully managed all waste streams generated by manufacturing operations while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

The disposal areas continue to provide adequate capacity and functionality for current operations. No unusual conditions or concerns were identified during the reporting period that would require modification of current disposal methods.

I will continue to monitor disposal operations and provide monthly reporting to ensure proper documentation of facility waste management activities.
