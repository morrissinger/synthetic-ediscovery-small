# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Woburn Board of Public Works  
**FROM:** Robert E. Sullivan, City Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** June 12, 1964  
**RE:** Well G Pumping Test Performance Analysis and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

Following the completion of initial pumping tests and operational assessment of Well G, which began service in January 1964, I am pleased to report that the well is performing within acceptable parameters for municipal water supply. The well has demonstrated consistent output capacity and appears to be drawing from a reliable aquifer source in the eastern section of our service area. This memorandum provides technical analysis of pumping performance, water quality observations, and recommendations for ongoing operations.

## Pumping Test Results and Performance Analysis

Well G, drilled to a depth of 88 feet and located approximately 200 yards east of the Aberjona River, has undergone comprehensive testing over the past five months of operation. The well consistently produces 400 gallons per minute at optimal pumping rates, with sustainable output of 350 gallons per minute during extended operation periods. Static water level measurements indicate the well draws from an aquifer with good recharge characteristics, maintaining water levels between 12 and 16 feet below ground surface depending on seasonal conditions and regional precipitation patterns.

The pumping equipment, consisting of a 10-horsepower submersible pump manufactured by Goulds Manufacturing Company, has operated reliably with minimal maintenance requirements. Electrical consumption averages 8.2 kilowatt hours per thousand gallons produced, which compares favorably to our existing wells in the central district. The well casing, constructed of 8-inch steel pipe with concrete grout seal, shows no signs of structural compromise or infiltration issues that might affect long-term performance.

During peak demand periods in May, Well G successfully supplemented our primary water sources, providing approximately 15% of total municipal supply during high-consumption days. The well's location in East Woburn makes it particularly valuable for serving residential areas east of Main Street, where water pressure had occasionally been marginal during summer months in previous years.

## Water Quality Assessment and Treatment Considerations

Initial water quality testing conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in February 1964 indicated that Well G water meets all current state standards for municipal consumption. The water exhibits typical characteristics of groundwater drawn from glacial deposits in this region, with moderate mineral content and neutral pH levels. Total dissolved solids measure 180 parts per million, which is well within acceptable ranges and consistent with other municipal wells in the Woburn system.

The water requires minimal treatment beyond standard chlorination procedures already in place throughout our distribution system. Chlorine demand testing indicates that 0.8 parts per million residual chlorine maintains adequate disinfection throughout the distribution network serving East Woburn. Iron and manganese levels are negligible, eliminating concerns about taste, odor, or staining that have occasionally affected other wells in our system.

I recommend continuing quarterly water quality monitoring in accordance with state requirements, with particular attention to bacterial indicators and chlorine residuals. The Department of Public Health has indicated they will include Well G in their routine sampling program, which should provide additional oversight of water quality standards.

## Operational Recommendations and Future Planning

Based on performance data collected over the past five months, I recommend designating Well G as a primary supplemental source for the East Woburn service area, with capability to serve as emergency backup for the entire eastern district if needed. The well should be operated primarily during peak demand periods from May through September, with reduced utilization during winter months when overall system demand decreases.

To optimize long-term performance, I recommend installing automatic controls that will cycle the well on and off based on reservoir levels and system pressure requirements. This will minimize unnecessary wear on pumping equipment while ensuring adequate water availability during high-demand periods. The estimated cost for automated controls is $1,200, which should be recoverable through reduced labor costs and improved system efficiency within two years.

Regular maintenance should include monthly inspection of pumping equipment, quarterly water level measurements, and annual performance testing to monitor any changes in well capacity or water quality. I also recommend establishing a dedicated electrical service connection to eliminate dependency on temporary power arrangements currently in place.

## Conclusion

Well G represents a valuable addition to Woburn's municipal water infrastructure, providing reliable supplemental capacity to serve our growing community. The well's performance exceeds initial projections and should continue to serve East Woburn residents effectively for many years. I recommend formal acceptance of the well into permanent service and approval of the operational procedures outlined in this memorandum.

The Board's continued support for infrastructure improvements ensures that Woburn maintains a safe and reliable water supply system capable of meeting the needs of our 35,000 residents. I am available to discuss any questions regarding Well G operations or to provide additional technical information as needed.
