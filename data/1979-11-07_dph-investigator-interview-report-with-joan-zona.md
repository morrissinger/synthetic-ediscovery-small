## BACKGROUND

This interview was conducted as part of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's ongoing investigation into the cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn. The interview focuses on the medical history and environmental exposures of Michael Zona, who died of acute lymphoblastic leukemia on March 15, 1979, at age 12.

## FAMILY DEMOGRAPHICS AND RESIDENCE HISTORY

Joan and Robert Zona moved to 48 Pine Street in East Woburn in September 1965, when Joan was pregnant with their second child, Michael. The family has resided at this address continuously since that time. The Pine Street residence is located approximately 0.8 miles southeast of municipal Wells G and H, within the primary service area for water distributed from these sources.

Mrs. Zona confirmed that the family's domestic water supply has been exclusively municipal water from the City of Woburn system since their arrival in 1965. She stated that they have never used well water or any alternative water source for drinking, cooking, or bathing. The family did not install any water filtration or treatment systems during their residence.

## MEDICAL HISTORY - MICHAEL ZONA

### Birth and Early Childhood (1966-1972)

Michael Robert Zona was born on February 14, 1967, at Winchester Hospital. Birth weight was 7 pounds, 3 ounces. Mrs. Zona reported a normal pregnancy and delivery with no complications. She breastfed Michael for approximately 8 months, supplementing with formula prepared using municipal tap water beginning at 4 months.

Mrs. Zona described Michael as a healthy infant and toddler. She noted no unusual illnesses, hospitalizations, or developmental concerns during his first six years of life. Routine pediatric care was provided by Dr. William Morrison at Woburn Pediatric Associates.

### School Years and Symptom Onset (1972-1978)

Michael attended East Woburn Elementary School beginning in September 1972. Mrs. Zona recalled that he was an active child who enjoyed baseball and swimming at the YMCA. She noted that the family regularly used Pine Street Playground, located approximately three blocks from their home.

In the fall of 1977, Mrs. Zona began noticing changes in Michael's energy level and appetite. She described a gradual onset of fatigue, particularly after school activities. Initially, she attributed these symptoms to normal childhood growth patterns and the demands of fifth grade.

### Acute Phase and Diagnosis (1978-1979)

Mrs. Zona provided detailed recollection of the progression of Michael's illness:

**December 1978:** Michael developed persistent bruising on his legs and arms. Mrs. Zona initially thought this was related to his participation in youth hockey at the local rink. However, the bruises appeared disproportionate to any known trauma and were slow to heal.

**January 1979:** Michael complained of bone pain, particularly in his legs and lower back. He began having difficulty sleeping and showed decreased interest in food. Mrs. Zona scheduled an appointment with Dr. Morrison.

**February 12, 1979:** Following blood work ordered by Dr. Morrison, the family received a call requesting immediate consultation with a pediatric hematologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. Mrs. Zona recalled the exact date because it was two days before Michael's 12th birthday.

**February 15, 1979:** Dr. Robert Chen at MGH confirmed the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia following bone marrow biopsy. Mrs. Zona described this as "the worst day of our lives."

### Treatment and Progression

Michael began chemotherapy treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital under the care of the pediatric oncology team. Mrs. Zona maintained detailed records of his treatment schedule, medication regimen, and response to therapy, which she provided for copying during the interview.

Despite initial positive response to treatment in March 1979, Michael's condition deteriorated rapidly in early March. He was hospitalized on March 10, 1979, and died five days later on March 15, 1979.

## ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT

### Water Consumption Patterns

Mrs. Zona estimated that Michael consumed 4-6 glasses of tap water daily, in addition to water used for food preparation. She specifically noted that Michael preferred cold tap water and often drank directly from the kitchen faucet after playing outdoors.

The family regularly prepared infant formula, coffee, tea, and cooking water using unfiltered municipal tap water. Mrs. Zona confirmed that they never boiled water for consumption except when specifically required for cooking.

### Recreational Activities

Mrs. Zona identified several recreational activities that may have involved additional exposure to municipal water:

- **Swimming:** Michael participated in swim lessons at Woburn YMCA pool (filled with municipal water) from ages 6-11
- **Ice Skating:** Regular use of outdoor rink at Pine Street Playground during winter months
- **Baseball:** Summer league play at East Woburn Little League fields, where children regularly drank from water fountains connected to municipal supply

### Potential Industrial Exposure

When asked about awareness of nearby industrial operations, Mrs. Zona stated that the family was generally aware of the Grace/Cryovac facility and the tannery operations, but had no specific knowledge of their waste disposal practices or potential environmental impact.

She noted occasional chemical odors in the neighborhood, particularly during summer months, but stated that residents generally assumed these were normal industrial emissions. She recalled no specific complaints to city officials regarding environmental concerns prior to 1979.

## FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY

Mrs. Zona provided comprehensive family medical history:

**Maternal Side:** No history of cancer, leukemia, or other hematologic disorders
**Paternal Side:** Robert Zona's father died of lung cancer in 1974 (lifetime smoker, age 67)

**Siblings:** Michael's older sister Patricia (born 1964) and younger brother David (born 1969) have shown no signs of serious illness. Both children have had routine pediatric care with normal growth and development.

## ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS

Mrs. Zona expressed frustration with what she perceived as delayed recognition of the potential environmental causes of Michael's illness. She stated that multiple families in the neighborhood had experienced childhood cancers, but that no systematic investigation had been undertaken until after several deaths occurred.

She specifically mentioned the Anderson family on Meadow Street and the Kane family on Salem Street as having lost children to leukemia around the same time period. Mrs. Zona indicated willingness to provide contact information for other affected families if helpful to the investigation.

## DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED

Mrs. Zona provided the following materials for copying and inclusion in the case file:

1. Complete medical records from Dr. Morrison (pediatric care 1967-1979)
2. Hospital records from Massachusetts General Hospital (February-March 1979)
3. Medication logs and treatment schedules maintained by family
4. Death certificate (certified copy)
5. Photographs of Michael at various ages showing physical development

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on this interview, I recommend:

1. **Follow-up Environmental Testing:** Conduct comprehensive analysis of current and historical water quality data for the Pine Street area service zone
2. **Sibling Monitoring:** Establish ongoing medical surveillance protocol for Patricia and David Zona
3. **Neighborhood Canvas:** Expand interview process to include other families in the immediate geographic area
4. **Industrial Records Review:** Obtain and analyze waste disposal records from Grace/Cryovac and Beatrice Foods facilities for the period 1965-1979

## INVESTIGATOR ASSESSMENT

This interview supports the hypothesis of environmental causation in Michael Zona's leukemia case. The family's exclusive reliance on municipal water from Wells G and H, combine
