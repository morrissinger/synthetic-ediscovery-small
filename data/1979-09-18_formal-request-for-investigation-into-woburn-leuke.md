## STATEMENT OF FACTS

### I. BACKGROUND AND JURISDICTIONAL BASIS

This petition is submitted pursuant to the authority of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to investigate matters affecting public health under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 5. The undersigned respectfully requests immediate investigation into an apparent cluster of childhood leukemia cases in the East Woburn area of Woburn, Massachusetts, which may be connected to environmental contamination of the municipal water supply.

### II. IDENTIFICATION OF AFFECTED AREA

The geographic area of concern encompasses the eastern section of Woburn, Massachusetts, specifically those residential neighborhoods served by municipal Wells G and H during the period from 1964 to May 1979. This area includes but is not limited to:

- Pine Street neighborhood
- Cranberry Circle area
- Salem Street corridor
- Washington Street residential sections
- Adjacent streets and developments served by the affected water system

### III. DOCUMENTED CASES OF CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA

Through personal investigation and communication with other families in the affected area, I have identified the following cases of childhood leukemia diagnosed between 1969 and 1979:

1. **James Anderson** (my son)
   - Date of Birth: March 12, 1967
   - Date of Diagnosis: August 1972
   - Type: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
   - Date of Death: January 21, 1981
   - Residence: 6 Cranberry Circle, Woburn

2. **Kevin Kane Jr.**
   - Approximate Date of Birth: 1963
   - Date of Diagnosis: Approximately 1970
   - Residence: Pine Street area
   - Status: Deceased

3. **Michael Zona**
   - Date of Diagnosis: Approximately 1973
   - Residence: Eastern Woburn residential area
   - Status: Under treatment

4. **Patrick Toomey**
   - Date of Diagnosis: Approximately 1974
   - Residence: Salem Street corridor
   - Status: Under treatment

5. **Carl Robbins III**
   - Date of Diagnosis: Approximately 1975
   - Residence: Eastern Woburn residential area
   - Status: Under treatment

6. **Roland Gamache**
   - Date of Diagnosis: Approximately 1976
   - Residence: Washington Street residential section
   - Status: Under treatment

### IV. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE

Based on national childhood leukemia incidence rates of approximately 3-4 cases per 100,000 children annually, the concentration of six confirmed cases within a limited geographic area over a ten-year period represents a statistically significant cluster that warrants immediate professional investigation. The affected area serves an estimated population of fewer than 5,000 residents, with approximately 1,200 children under the age of 15 during the relevant period.

### V. POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

#### A. Municipal Water Supply Contamination

In May 1979, routine testing of Wells G and H revealed significant contamination with volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethylene and other industrial solvents. These wells, which opened in 1964 and 1966 respectively, provided water to the exact geographic area where the childhood leukemia cases have been identified.

#### B. Industrial Activities in Proximity to Water Sources

The following industrial operations are located within the watershed area of Wells G and H:

1. **W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc.**
   - Location: 369 Washington Street, East Woburn
   - Operations: Manufacturing of packaging machinery
   - Chemical Usage: Trichloroethylene and other industrial solvents
   - Waste Disposal Practices: Unknown but suspected improper disposal

2. **Beatrice Foods Inc./John J. Riley Company**
   - Location: 228 Salem Street, Woburn
   - Operations: Leather tanning operations
   - Chemical Usage: Various tanning chemicals and solvents
   - Waste Disposal Practices: Historical disposal on adjacent property

### VI. TEMPORAL CORRELATION

The timeline of leukemia diagnoses correlates with the operational period of Wells G and H:

- Wells G and H began operation: 1964 and 1966
- First identified leukemia case: Approximately 1970
- Peak diagnosis period: 1972-1976
- Wells closed due to contamination: May 1979

This temporal relationship strongly suggests a causal connection between the contaminated water supply and the childhood leukemia cluster.

## REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATION

Based on the foregoing facts, I respectfully request that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health immediately undertake the following investigative actions:

### 1. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY

Conduct a comprehensive epidemiological investigation to:
- Confirm and document all cases of childhood leukemia in the affected area
- Establish statistical significance of the cluster
- Identify potential additional cases
- Analyze demographic and geographic patterns

### 2. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Coordinate with appropriate state and federal agencies to:
- Test soil and groundwater contamination in the Wells G and H watershed
- Identify sources of chemical contamination
- Assess the extent of environmental impact
- Determine migration patterns of contaminants

### 3. MEDICAL REVIEW

Establish a medical review process to:
- Examine medical records of affected children
- Coordinate with treating physicians
- Provide medical monitoring for residents of the affected area
- Establish protocols for ongoing health surveillance

### 4. REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT

Work with appropriate regulatory agencies to:
- Investigate industrial waste disposal practices
- Ensure compliance with environmental regulations
- Take enforcement action against responsible parties
- Prevent further contamination

---

## LEGAL BASIS FOR ACTION

This request is supported by the following legal authorities:

### Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 5
The Department of Public Health has broad authority to investigate and address threats to public health, including environmental health hazards.

### Federal Safe Drinking Water Act
Recent federal legislation establishes standards for public water systems and provides authority for investigation of contamination incidents.

### Common Law Duty of Care
Industrial operators have a legal duty to prevent harm to neighboring communities through proper waste disposal and environmental stewardship.

---

## URGENCY OF REQUEST

The undersigned emphasizes the urgent nature of this request based on the following factors:

1. **Continuing Exposure Risk**: Although Wells G and H have been closed, residents may continue to be exposed to contaminated groundwater through private wells or residual contamination.

2. **Progressive Disease**: Leukemia is a progressive disease, and early identification and treatment of additional cases may be critical to patient outcomes.

3. **Community Health**: The affected community has a right to know the extent of environmental contamination and health risks.

4. **Evidence Preservation**: Industrial records, environmental samples, and other evidence relevant to the investigation may be lost or destroyed if action is not taken promptly.

---

## CONCLUSION

The concentration of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn, coinciding with the operation of contaminated municipal wells and proximity to industrial chemical operations, presents compelling evidence of an environmental health crisis requiring immediate professional investigation. The families affected by this tragedy deserve answers, and the broader community deserves protection from ongoing health risks.

I respectfully urge the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to treat this matter with the urgency it deserves and to commence a comprehensive investigation without delay. I stand ready to provide additional information and to cooperate fully with any investigation undertaken by your department.

The children of Woburn have suffered enough.
