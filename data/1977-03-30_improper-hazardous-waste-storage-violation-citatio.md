## NOTICE OF VIOLATION

**WHEREAS**, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection ("Department") has conducted an inspection of the W.R. Grace Company Cryovac manufacturing facility located at 68 Washington Street, Woburn, Massachusetts ("Facility") on March 15, 1977, pursuant to the authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21, Section 43 and the regulations promulgated thereunder; and

**WHEREAS**, said inspection was conducted by Department personnel including Senior Environmental Engineer Robert J. Sullivan and Chemical Analyst Patricia M. O'Brien in response to citizen complaints regarding unusual odors and potential groundwater contamination in the East Woburn area; and

**WHEREAS**, the inspection revealed conditions at the Facility that constitute violations of state environmental protection laws and regulations;

**NOW THEREFORE**, the Department hereby issues this Notice of Violation to W.R. Grace Company for the following violations observed at the Facility:

## VIOLATIONS CITED

### Violation 1: Improper Storage of Hazardous Chemical Waste
**Citation:** 310 CMR 19.017(2)(a) - Storage of hazardous waste without adequate containment

During the March 15, 1977 inspection, Department personnel observed approximately forty-seven (47) fifty-five gallon drums containing industrial chemical waste stored in an open area behind the main manufacturing building without secondary containment, proper labeling, or weather protection. Visual inspection revealed several drums showing signs of corrosion and potential leakage. Chemical analysis of soil samples collected from the storage area detected the presence of trichloroethylene (TCE) at concentrations of 2,400 parts per million and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) at concentrations of 1,800 parts per million, levels significantly exceeding background concentrations and indicating ongoing environmental contamination.

### Violation 2: Unauthorized Discharge of Industrial Waste
**Citation:** 310 CMR 19.023(1) - Discharge of industrial waste without proper permit

The inspection documented evidence of direct discharge of untreated industrial wastewater containing chlorinated solvents into an unnamed tributary of the Aberjona River via a concrete outfall pipe located on the eastern boundary of the Facility property. Water samples collected from the discharge point on March 15, 1977 contained TCE at 12,000 parts per billion and PCE at 8,500 parts per billion. The Facility does not possess a valid National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for this discharge point, nor has the Company filed the required Industrial Waste Survey forms with the Department.

### Violation 3: Failure to Implement Proper Waste Management Procedures
**Citation:** 310 CMR 19.019(3) - Failure to maintain adequate waste management records

The Company has failed to maintain proper documentation of hazardous waste generation, storage, and disposal activities as required by state regulations. During the inspection, Facility management was unable to produce manifests, disposal records, or waste characterization data for the previous twelve-month period. This deficiency prevents the Department from determining the full extent of environmental contamination and assessing compliance with waste disposal requirements.

## ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

The violations documented at the Facility pose significant risks to public health and environmental quality. The improper storage and discharge of chlorinated solvents creates the potential for groundwater contamination that could affect municipal water supplies and private wells in the surrounding area. Of particular concern is the proximity of the Facility to municipal Wells G and H, which serve approximately 5,000 residents in the East Woburn area and are located within the probable groundwater flow path from the contaminated areas of the Facility.

Laboratory analysis conducted by the Department indicates that soil and groundwater contamination at the Facility has migrated beyond the property boundaries. Monitoring well MW-1, installed 200 feet downgradient from the drum storage area, shows TCE concentrations of 340 parts per billion and PCE concentrations of 180 parts per billion in groundwater samples collected on March 20, 1977. These concentrations exceed proposed federal drinking water standards and demonstrate that contamination has entered the regional groundwater system.

## REQUIRED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

W.R. Grace Company is hereby ORDERED to take the following corrective actions within the specified timeframes:

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Within 30 Days of Receipt):**

1. **Secure All Hazardous Waste Storage:** Remove all improperly stored drums to an approved hazardous waste storage facility or construct adequate secondary containment with leak detection capabilities.

2. **Cease Unauthorized Discharges:** Immediately discontinue all unpermitted discharges to surface waters and implement interim treatment measures for all industrial wastewater.

3. **Submit Emergency Response Plan:** Provide a detailed plan for addressing immediate environmental threats and preventing further contamination migration.

**SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Within 90 Days of Receipt):**

1. **Install Groundwater Monitoring System:** Establish a network of monitoring wells to delineate the extent of groundwater contamination and monitor plume migration.

2. **Submit NPDES Permit Application:** File complete permit applications for all industrial discharge points with supporting documentation of waste characterization and treatment capabilities.

3. **Implement Waste Management Program:** Establish proper procedures for hazardous waste identification, storage, and disposal in compliance with all applicable regulations.

**LONG-TERM ACTIONS (Within 180 Days of Receipt):**

1. **Remediation Plan Submission:** Submit a comprehensive environmental remediation plan addressing soil and groundwater contamination, including cleanup standards, remedial technologies, and implementation schedules.

2. **Financial Assurance:** Provide evidence of financial capability to complete all required remedial actions through bonding, insurance, or other acceptable mechanisms.

## PENALTY ASSESSMENT

Based on the severity of the violations, the potential for environmental harm, and the Company's failure to implement proper environmental management practices, the Department assesses administrative penalties in the amount of **Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars ($35,000)** as follows:

- Violation 1 (Improper Storage): $15,000
- Violation 2 (Unauthorized Discharge): $15,000  
- Violation 3 (Recordkeeping Failure): $5,000

Payment of assessed penalties shall be made within thirty (30) days of receipt of this Notice by certified check or money order payable to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

## LEGAL AUTHORITY AND APPEAL RIGHTS

This Notice is issued pursuant to the authority granted to the Department under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21, Sections 27 through 53, and the regulations adopted thereunder. Failure to comply with the requirements of this Notice may result in additional enforcement actions, including civil penalties, injunctive relief, and referral for criminal prosecution.

W.R. Grace Company has the right to request an adjudicatory hearing before the Department within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of this Notice. Any such request must be submitted in writing to the Director, Division of Water Pollution Control, at the address listed above and must specify the grounds for challenging the violations or penalties assessed.

## COMPLIANCE MONITORING

The Department will conduct follow-up inspections to verify compliance with the requirements of this Notice. The Company shall provide Department personnel with unrestricted access to the Facility and all relevant records during normal business hours. Failure to provide such access may result in additional enforcement actions.

This Notice does not preclude the Department from taking additional enforcement actions if further violations are discovered or if the Company fails to comply with the requirements specified herein. The Department reserves the right to pursue all available legal remedies to ensure protection of public health and environmental quality.
