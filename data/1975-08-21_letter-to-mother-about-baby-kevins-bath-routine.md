# Letter to Mother About Baby Kevin's Bath Routine

August 21, 1975

Dear Mom,

I hope this letter finds you and Dad in good health. Things here in Woburn have been keeping me busy with little Kevin, as you can imagine. He's growing so fast - already eight months old! I wanted to write to you about something that's been on my mind lately, and I know you always have such good advice about taking care of babies.

I've been having some concerns about Kevin's bath time routine. You remember how you always told me that a good warm bath was the best thing for a fussy baby? Well, I've been following your advice religiously, giving Kevin his evening bath in our upstairs tub every night around six o'clock. But lately, I've noticed that he seems more irritable after his baths rather than soothed by them. His skin has been looking a bit red and blotchy, especially around his chest and arms, and he's been crying more than usual in the evenings after I get him out of the tub.

At first I thought maybe I was making the water too warm, so I've been checking it carefully with my elbow like you taught me. The temperature seems just right - nice and warm but not hot. I've also been using that gentle baby soap we talked about when you visited last month, the Johnson & Johnson one that's supposed to be so mild. But Kevin still seems uncomfortable, and I'm starting to wonder if there's something else going on.

Carl thinks I'm worrying too much, you know how men are about these things. He says babies just cry and that Kevin looks perfectly healthy to him. And it's true that Kevin is eating well and gaining weight like he should. Dr. Peterson at his last checkup said he's developing normally, hitting all his milestones right on schedule. But a mother knows when something isn't quite right, don't you think? There's just something about the way he reacts to bath time that doesn't seem normal to me.

I've been talking to some of the other mothers in the neighborhood, and it's funny - several of them have mentioned similar things about their little ones. Joan Zona down on Montvale Road was telling me just last week that her Michael used to get fussy after baths too, though he's older now and seems to have outgrown it. And Mary Anderson mentioned that her Jimmy sometimes gets skin irritation, though she thought it might be from the laundry detergent. It makes me wonder if there's something going around, or if it's just one of those things that happens with babies.

Do you remember if Carl Jr. or I ever had problems like this when we were babies? I know you kept such careful notes about everything when we were little. Maybe this is just something that runs in the family, or maybe I'm doing something wrong without realizing it. I've been so careful about keeping everything clean - I scrub that tub thoroughly before every bath, and I always rinse Kevin off really well to make sure there's no soap residue left on his skin.

The water here in Woburn seems fine to me - it doesn't have any funny smell or taste like some places do. Carl says the city just opened some new wells a few years back to improve the water supply, so it should be good quality. But I can't help wondering if that could have anything to do with Kevin's fussiness. Maybe the water is too hard, or has too much chlorine? I remember when we lived in that apartment before Kevin was born, the water there was definitely different - you could taste the chlorine more. This water doesn't taste like anything special, which I suppose is good.

I've been thinking about trying some of those oatmeal baths that Mrs. Kane mentioned - she said they're supposed to be very soothing for sensitive skin. Have you ever heard of using oatmeal in a baby's bath? It sounds a little strange to me, but if it might help Kevin feel more comfortable, I'm willing to try it. I just want to make sure I'm doing everything right for him.

Carl has been working such long hours lately at the garage, so most of the baby care falls to me during the week. Not that I mind - I love taking care of Kevin, and I know Carl works hard to provide for us. But sometimes I feel like I'm second-guessing myself about everything. Is this normal? Did you ever feel this way when Carl Jr. and I were babies? I suppose every new mother goes through this, but it would help to know I'm not the only one who worries about every little thing.

I keep thinking about how you used to tell me that motherhood would come naturally, and mostly it has. Kevin and I have settled into such a nice routine during the day. He takes his morning nap while I get the housework done, and then we have our afternoon playtime before Carl gets home. It's really just the evening bath routine that's been bothering me. Maybe I should try giving him baths earlier in the day, or every other day instead of every evening? What do you think?

I hope you and Dad can come visit again soon. Kevin changes so much from week to week, and I know you love seeing him. Plus, I always feel more confident about things when you're here to give me advice. Carl says I worry too much, but you understand that it's only because I want to do everything right for Kevin.

Please give Dad my love, and tell him that Carl says hello. We're looking forward to seeing you both at Thanksgiving if not before then.

All my love,
Donna

P.S. - I almost forgot to mention that Kevin has started trying to pull himself up to standing when he's in his crib. He's getting so strong! I know he'll be walking before we know it.
