Dear Attorney,

Thank you for your letter of May 15th regarding legal representation for our family in connection with James's death and the contamination of our water supply. I have given your proposal considerable thought over the past several days, and I wanted to respond to your questions about our situation and our willingness to pursue legal action.

As I mentioned when we spoke briefly on the telephone, James died on January 18th of this year after a nine-year battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia. He was only twelve years old. The diagnosis came in January 1972, when he was just three, and from that moment forward our lives revolved around his treatments, his hospitalizations, and our desperate hope that somehow he would recover. My other children, Christine and Charles, watched their little brother suffer through chemotherapy, radiation, and countless procedures. We all held onto hope until the very end, but the leukemia took him from us.

What makes this tragedy even more difficult to bear is learning that James's illness—and his death—may have been preventable. When the state health officials came to our neighborhood earlier this year to investigate the cluster of childhood leukemia cases, they told us that our municipal wells had been contaminated with industrial chemicals for years. Wells G and H, which supplied water to our section of Woburn, contained trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene at levels far exceeding what should be considered safe. The officials explained that these chemicals are known to cause cancer, particularly leukemia in children. James drank this water his entire life. I gave it to him as a baby, mixed his formula with it, cooked his meals with it, never knowing I was poisoning my own child.

You asked about our family's health history and exposure. I have lived at this address for seventeen years, since 1964. All three of my children were raised in this house, drinking water from Wells G and H. James was born in July 1968, two years after Well H opened and four years after Well G began operating. From the moment of his birth—indeed, from the time I was pregnant with him—he was exposed to these contaminated waters. Christine, my oldest, was born in 1962, before the wells opened, but she too drank this water throughout her childhood and teenage years. Charles, born in 1966, has consumed this water his entire life as well. So far, thank God, Christine and Charles show no signs of illness, but I live in constant fear that they too may develop cancer from this exposure.

The other families in our neighborhood are facing similar anguish. The Kanes lost their boy Kevin just last year—he was only eight years old. The Zonas, the Toomeys, the Robbins family, the Gamaches—we've all watched our children suffer and die from leukemia, and now we know why. These companies—W.R. Grace, Cryovac, Beatrice Foods, and the Riley Company—they dumped their waste chemicals into our ground, and those chemicals found their way into our drinking water. They poisoned our children for their own convenience and profit.

You mentioned that this type of case would be difficult and expensive to pursue. I understand that proving the connection between the contaminated water and our children's illnesses will require extensive scientific evidence and expert testimony. I also understand that these corporations have significant resources to defend themselves. But I need you to understand something: James is gone, and nothing will bring him back. However, if there is any chance that pursuing this case might prevent other families from enduring what we have endured, then I believe we have a moral obligation to try.

I am not a wealthy woman. I work as a clerk at the phone company, and the medical bills from James's treatment have left our family in significant debt. I cannot afford to pay large legal fees upfront, but I am willing to proceed if you believe we have a strong case and if you are willing to work on a contingency basis. I have kept all of James's medical records, and I can provide documentation of our residence and water usage during the relevant time periods. I am also prepared to testify about James's illness, his treatments, and the impact on our family.

What I need to know from you is whether you truly believe we can hold these companies accountable for what they have done. The state officials have confirmed that the wells were contaminated and that the contamination came from industrial sources. The timing of James's diagnosis—just eight years after the wells opened—seems more than coincidental. But I need to know that you have the expertise and the commitment to see this case through to the end, regardless of how long it takes or how much the defendants spend trying to defeat us.

I have spoken with several of the other affected families, and there is strong interest in joining together in this legal action. Anne Kane, whose son Kevin died last year, has expressed her willingness to participate. The Zona family, who lost their son Michael, are also considering legal action. If we can present a united front, perhaps we can demonstrate the pattern of harm that these companies have caused to our community.

Please let me know your thoughts on how we should proceed. I am available to meet with you at your convenience to discuss the details of James's case and to review any documents you might need. I can be reached at home most evenings after 6:00 PM, or you can contact me during the day at the phone company at 617-935-4200.

I want justice for James, and I want to ensure that no other family has to endure what we have been through. If you believe we can achieve these goals through legal action, then I am ready to move forward.

Sincerely,

Anne Anderson
