## FINDINGS

### Storage and Containment

**Current Practices:**
Storage of chemical materials occurs in three primary locations: the main chemical warehouse (Building C), outdoor tank farm (Area 7), and temporary staging areas adjacent to production lines. The main warehouse maintains 55-gallon drums on standard industrial shelving, while the tank farm houses larger quantities in above-ground steel tanks ranging from 500 to 2,000 gallon capacity.

**Identified Issues:**
Inspection revealed several containers in Building C showing signs of corrosion, particularly drums containing TCE and PCE stored since early 1973. Approximately 12% of inspected containers exhibited surface rust or minor leakage around closure seals. Secondary containment measures are limited to absorbent materials placed beneath suspect containers.

The outdoor tank farm lacks adequate secondary containment for three of the five storage tanks. Current configuration relies on earthen berms that show evidence of erosion and may not provide sufficient capacity in the event of a major release.

### Handling Procedures

**Current Practices:**
Chemical transfer operations follow established procedures requiring two-person teams for movements exceeding 25 gallons. Personal protective equipment includes rubber gloves, safety goggles, and canvas aprons. Ventilation in handling areas operates on a scheduled basis during normal production hours.

**Identified Issues:**
Observations during the review period documented instances of single-person handling of chemical containers, particularly during second and third shift operations when supervision is reduced. PPE compliance varies significantly between shifts, with evening personnel showing lower adherence to established protocols.

Ventilation systems in Buildings B and C operate intermittently due to energy conservation measures implemented in response to recent fuel cost increases. This has resulted in periods of inadequate air circulation during chemical handling activities.

### Disposal Practices

**Current Practices:**
Waste solvents and contaminated materials are collected in designated containers and removed by licensed disposal contractors on a monthly schedule. Primary contractor, New England Waste Management Services, provides transportation and disposal services under contract WRG-74-021.

**Identified Issues:**
Documentation review revealed gaps in waste manifesting procedures, with approximately 15% of disposal events lacking complete paperwork. Some waste materials have been stored on-site for periods exceeding 90 days due to contractor scheduling delays.

Site inspection identified an area behind Building D where historical disposal activities may have occurred. Soil discoloration and chemical odors suggest past practices may have involved on-site disposal of liquid wastes. No current documentation exists regarding the extent or nature of materials that may have been disposed in this area.

### Training and Personnel

**Current Status:**
Chemical handling personnel receive initial safety training upon hire and annual refresher sessions. Training records indicate 89% of current staff have completed required coursework within the past 18 months.

**Areas of Concern:**
Interview results suggest inconsistent understanding of emergency response procedures among personnel. Several employees were unable to correctly identify the location of emergency eyewash stations or describe proper spill response protocols.

Turnover in chemical handling positions has averaged 23% annually, requiring frequent training of new personnel. Current training programs may not adequately address the specific hazards associated with chlorinated solvents.

## INCIDENT ANALYSIS

Review of incident reports from January through September 1974 identified 14 reportable events involving chemical materials:

- **Minor Spills (< 5 gallons):** 8 incidents
- **Equipment Failures:** 3 incidents  
- **Personnel Exposures:** 2 incidents
- **Container Failures:** 1 incident

The most significant incident occurred on June 12, 1974, when a transfer pump failure resulted in the release of approximately 35 gallons of TCE in the Building C loading area. Response procedures were followed, and affected soil was excavated and disposed off-site. However, documentation indicates the incident was not reported to regulatory authorities within required timeframes.

Two personnel exposure incidents involved inhalation of solvent vapors during maintenance activities. Both employees received medical evaluation and returned to work without restrictions, but the incidents highlight potential inadequacies in confined space entry procedures.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

Current operations maintain general compliance with applicable OSHA workplace safety standards. However, several areas require attention to ensure continued compliance as regulatory requirements evolve:

### Documentation Requirements
Waste disposal manifesting procedures need strengthening to ensure complete documentation of all disposal activities. Current gaps could result in regulatory violations if subjected to inspection.

### Reporting Obligations
The June 12 spill incident should have been reported to state environmental authorities within 24 hours of occurrence. Failure to report represents a potential compliance violation that could result in penalties.

### Storage Standards
Secondary containment deficiencies in the tank farm area may not meet evolving regulatory expectations for chemical storage facilities. Proactive improvements would demonstrate commitment to environmental protection.
