**HAZARD IDENTIFICATION**

**Primary Routes of Exposure:** Inhalation, skin contact, eye contact

**Acute Health Effects:**
- **Inhalation:** High concentrations may cause dizziness, headache, nausea, and drowsiness. Prolonged exposure to elevated concentrations may result in unconsciousness.
- **Skin Contact:** Repeated contact may cause defatting and drying of skin. Prolonged contact may result in dermatitis.
- **Eye Contact:** Direct contact may cause irritation and tearing.
- **Ingestion:** May cause nausea, vomiting, and central nervous system depression.

**Chronic Health Effects:**
Current industrial hygiene standards recognize trichloroethylene as having low chronic toxicity when used with proper ventilation and handling procedures. Some industrial studies suggest potential for liver effects with prolonged occupational exposure at concentrations exceeding recommended workplace limits.

**Threshold Limit Value:** 100 parts per million (ppm) as 8-hour time-weighted average, as established by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.

---

**FIRST AID MEASURES**

**Inhalation:** Remove person to fresh air immediately. If breathing is difficult, administer oxygen. If breathing has stopped, give artificial respiration. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist.

**Skin Contact:** Remove contaminated clothing. Wash affected area thoroughly with soap and water. If irritation develops or persists, seek medical attention.

**Eye Contact:** Flush eyes immediately with large amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Seek medical attention if irritation persists.

**Ingestion:** Do not induce vomiting. Give large quantities of water. Seek immediate medical attention.

---

**FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARDS**

**Flammability:** Trichloroethylene is non-flammable under normal conditions of use and storage.

**Decomposition Products:** When heated to decomposition or in contact with hot metal surfaces, trichloroethylene may form toxic gases including hydrogen chloride, chlorine, and phosgene.

**Fire Fighting:** Use water spray to cool containers. Use appropriate extinguishing media for surrounding fire. Firefighters should wear self-contained breathing apparatus.

---

**HANDLING AND STORAGE PRECAUTIONS**

**Handling:**
- Use only with adequate ventilation
- Avoid breathing vapors
- Avoid contact with skin and eyes
- Wash hands thoroughly after handling
- Do not eat, drink, or smoke while handling
- Ground containers when transferring to prevent static electricity buildup

**Storage:**
- Store in cool, dry, well-ventilated area
- Keep containers tightly closed
- Store away from heat sources and direct sunlight
- Protect from physical damage
- Storage temperature should not exceed 40°C (104°F)

**Personal Protective Equipment:**
- Respiratory protection: Use approved respirator when ventilation is inadequate
- Eye protection: Chemical safety goggles recommended
- Skin protection: Impervious gloves (neoprene or nitrile rubber)
- Clothing: Long sleeves and long pants recommended for extended handling
