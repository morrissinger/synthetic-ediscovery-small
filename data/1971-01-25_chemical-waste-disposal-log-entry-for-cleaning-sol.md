# CRYOVAC INC. WASTE DISPOSAL LOG

**Facility:** Cryovac Inc. Manufacturing Plant  
**Location:** 543 Salem Street, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801  
**Log Entry No.:** WDL-1971-001-CS  
**Date:** January 25, 1971  
**Time:** 2:00 PM  
**Logged By:** Thomas Sullivan, Plant Supervisor  

## WASTE IDENTIFICATION

**Waste Type:** Industrial Cleaning Solvents  
**Source Department:** Production Line 3 - Film Manufacturing  
**Estimated Volume:** 350 gallons  
**Container Type:** 55-gallon steel drums (7 drums total)  

**Chemical Composition:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE) - approximately 60%
- Perchloroethylene (PCE) - approximately 25%  
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane - approximately 10%
- Mixed petroleum distillates - approximately 5%

## DISPOSAL METHOD

**Primary Disposal:** On-site lagoon system (Lagoon B-2)  
**Secondary Disposal:** Overflow directed to percolation area behind Building 7  
**Authorization:** Plant Manager verbal approval - cost reduction initiative per corporate directive

**Disposal Procedure:**
1. Drums transported via forklift to lagoon area at 3:15 PM
2. Contents emptied directly into lagoon using gravity feed system
3. Drums rinsed with water hose (rinse water also directed to lagoon)
4. Empty drums stored in drum yard for potential reuse

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

**Weather:** Clear, temperature 28°F  
**Ground Conditions:** Frozen surface, approximately 2 inches frost penetration  
**Lagoon Status:** Partially frozen with 6-inch ice layer  
**Water Table:** Estimated 8-10 feet below surface based on recent well data

## OPERATIONAL NOTES

Disposal completed without incident. Ice layer in lagoon cracked during disposal process, allowing solvents to penetrate to liquid layer beneath. Some surface pooling observed on ice, expected to infiltrate upon spring thaw. 

Production supervisor noted this disposal method significantly more cost-effective than previous off-site hazardous waste contractor (Suburban Disposal Co.) which charged $0.85 per gallon. Current on-site method reduces disposal costs to approximately $0.12 per gallon when factoring labor and equipment usage.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

**Permits Required:** None identified for on-site disposal  
**Notifications:** None required per current understanding of state regulations  
**Documentation:** Copy of this log to be filed with monthly environmental reports

**Note:** Recent EPA establishment (December 1970) may result in future regulatory changes. Plant management monitoring federal developments but no immediate compliance actions identified as necessary.

## PREVIOUS DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES (REFERENCE)

**January 18, 1971:** 280 gallons mixed solvents - same disposal method  
**January 11, 1971:** 420 gallons degreasing compounds - lagoon system  
**December 28, 1970:** 315 gallons cleaning solvents - lagoon system  

**Monthly Total (January 1971):** Approximately 1,365 gallons industrial solvents disposed via on-site lagoon system.

## SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

**Personal Protective Equipment:** Standard work gloves and safety glasses worn during disposal operations. Respiratory protection not deemed necessary for outdoor disposal activity.

**Spill Prevention:** No significant spills observed during current disposal. Minor splashing contained within lagoon perimeter.

**Fire Safety:** No smoking signs posted in disposal area. Fire extinguisher available on disposal vehicle.

## ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS

Lagoon system appears to be functioning as designed. Water levels have remained relatively constant despite continued disposal activities, suggesting adequate percolation rates through bottom sediments. Some discoloration of ice layer observed but considered normal given chemical composition of disposed materials.

Groundwater monitoring wells installed by previous contractor (Geotech Associates) in 1969 have not been sampled recently due to budget constraints. Wells remain accessible if future testing becomes required.

**Cost Savings Analysis:**  
- Previous off-site disposal cost: $297.50 per disposal event
- Current on-site disposal cost: $42.00 per disposal event  
- Monthly savings: Approximately $1,020.00
- Annual projected savings: $12,240.00
