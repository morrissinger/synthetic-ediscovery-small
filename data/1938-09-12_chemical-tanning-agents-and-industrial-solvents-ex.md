## OPERATIONAL NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

### Production Efficiency
The introduction of chrome tanning processes has significantly reduced processing time from 6-8 weeks to 3-4 weeks per batch, allowing for increased throughput and improved profit margins. The chrome sulfate-based tanning system has proven particularly effective for automotive leather applications, which represent our fastest-growing market segment.

### Chemical Storage and Safety
All chemical storage facilities have been inspected and found to be in compliance with current Massachusetts industrial safety regulations. The concrete storage areas adjacent to the Aberjona River provide adequate containment for normal operations. Drainage systems direct process water and chemical runoff to the natural settling areas downstream of the main facility.

### Cost Management Recommendations
1. **Bulk Purchasing Agreements:** Negotiating annual contracts with primary suppliers could reduce unit costs by 8-12%
2. **Inventory Optimization:** Implementing monthly rather than bi-monthly chemical deliveries would reduce storage requirements
3. **Process Efficiency:** The new chrome tanning system uses 15% fewer chemicals per hide processed

### Environmental Considerations
Current waste disposal practices comply with all applicable municipal and state regulations. Process water containing dissolved chemicals and tanning agents is directed through settling ponds before natural drainage into the Aberjona River system. This approach minimizes immediate environmental impact while maintaining cost-effective operations.

## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

**Total Chemical Expenses by Category:**
- Tanning Agents: $776.00 (27.2%)
- Industrial Solvents: $1,050.50 (36.8%)
- Acids and Alkalis: $209.50 (7.4%)
- Waste Disposal: $155.75 (5.5%)
- Storage and Handling: $282.25 (9.9%)
- Miscellaneous Supplies: $373.63 (13.1%)

**Cost per Pound of Finished Leather:** $0.087
**Percentage of Total Operating Costs:** 18.3%

---

## FORWARD PROJECTIONS

Based on current production schedules and confirmed orders, chemical expenses for the September-October period are projected to increase by approximately 8% due to:

1. Seasonal increase in leather goods production for winter markets
2. Expansion of chrome tanning capacity to meet automotive industry demands
3. Introduction of new synthetic tanning agents from European suppliers

**Projected Chemical Expenses (Sept-Oct 1938):** $3,075.00

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Supply Chain Security:** Establish backup suppliers for critical chemicals, particularly chrome compounds, given potential supply disruptions from European markets
2. **Process Modernization:** Consider investment in mechanized chemical application systems to reduce labor costs and improve consistency
3. **Quality Control:** Implement monthly chemical purity testing to ensure product quality standards
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Monitor proposed federal regulations regarding industrial chemical usage and waste disposal
