# SITE INSPECTION REPORT
## Wells G and H Closure Procedures Completed

**TO:** Thomas J. Sullivan, Director of Public Works  
**FROM:** Robert M. Whitman, P.E., City Engineer  
**DATE:** May 10, 1979  
**RE:** Final Site Inspection and Closure Documentation - Municipal Wells G and H

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents the completion of closure procedures for municipal Wells G and H in East Woburn, conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health directives issued May 4, 1979. Physical closure of both wells was completed on May 9, 1979, following confirmation of volatile organic compound contamination levels exceeding acceptable standards for potable water supply.

## SITE DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

**Well G Location:** Approximately 1,200 feet northeast of the intersection of Salem Street and Mishawum Road, East Woburn  
**Well H Location:** Approximately 800 feet southeast of Well G, adjacent to existing transmission main  
**Coordinates:** Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System (Zone Mainland)  
- Well G: N 2,954,320.5, E 777,845.2  
- Well H: N 2,953,890.1, E 778,210.8  

Both wells are situated within the Aberjona River Valley aquifer system, drawing from unconsolidated glacial deposits at depths of 60 feet (Well G) and 83 feet (Well H) below ground surface.

## CLOSURE METHODOLOGY

### Physical Closure Procedures

**May 8, 1979 - Preliminary Operations:**
- Disconnection of electrical service to pump houses
- Removal of submersible pumps from both wells using city-contracted crane service
- Isolation of wells from municipal distribution system via valve closure at transmission mains
- Installation of temporary security barriers around well heads

**May 9, 1979 - Final Closure:**
- Well casings sealed with bentonite clay plugs at 10-foot intervals from bottom to within 5 feet of surface
- Surface casings cut to 2 feet below grade
- Well heads capped with reinforced concrete slabs (4 feet × 4 feet × 8 inches thick)
- Installation of permanent identification markers per state requirements

### Documentation and Chain of Custody

All closure activities were witnessed by representatives from:
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health (Inspector: James R. McCarthy)
- City of Woburn Engineering Department
- Contracted well service company (Northeast Water Systems, Inc.)

Photographic documentation of each closure phase has been completed and filed with the Department of Public Works.

## CONTAMINATION ANALYSIS RESULTS

Laboratory analysis conducted by Massachusetts State Laboratory Institute revealed the following volatile organic compounds in final samples collected May 3, 1979:

**Well G Final Sample Results:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 267 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 21 parts per billion
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 12 parts per billion
- Chloroform: 8 parts per billion

**Well H Final Sample Results:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 183 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 39 parts per billion
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 18 parts per billion
- Chloroform: 15 parts per billion

All detected levels significantly exceed the proposed EPA drinking water standards for volatile organic compounds. The presence of these industrial solvents indicates contamination from nearby manufacturing operations.

## OPERATIONAL HISTORY AND WATER PRODUCTION

**Well G (Commissioned 1964):**
- Total operational period: 15 years, 1 month
- Average daily production: 1.2 million gallons
- Estimated total production: 6.57 billion gallons
- Primary service area: Eastern Woburn residential districts

**Well H (Commissioned 1966):**
- Total operational period: 13 years, 1 month  
- Average daily production: 800,000 gallons
- Estimated total production: 3.81 billion gallons
- Primary service area: Northeastern Woburn residential and commercial districts

Combined, these wells provided approximately 35% of the municipal water supply during their operational period, serving an estimated 5,200 residents in the affected distribution zones.

## ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATIONS

Site inspection revealed several environmental conditions of concern in the immediate vicinity of both wells:

### Industrial Activities - Northeast Sector
Visual inspection of the W.R. Grace Company facility at 369 Washington Street, located approximately 1,500 feet northeast of Well G, revealed:
- Multiple above-ground storage tanks of various sizes
- Evidence of historical waste disposal activities on the property
- Surface staining consistent with chemical spills or disposal
- Drainage patterns directing surface runoff toward the Aberjona River Valley

### Industrial Activities - Southwest Sector  
Inspection of the John J. Riley Company tannery property at 228 Salem Street, approximately 2,000 feet southwest of Well H, noted:
- Large waste lagoons containing discolored water
- Chemical odors emanating from the facility
- Historical disposal areas on adjacent undeveloped land
- Potential groundwater flow paths toward the well field

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Public Notification:** Issue comprehensive public notice to all residents served by Wells G and H regarding closure and potential health implications

2. **Alternative Water Supply:** Accelerate development of replacement water sources to maintain adequate system capacity

3. **Health Assessment:** Coordinate with Massachusetts Department of Public Health to conduct health impact assessment for affected residents

4. **Source Investigation:** Initiate comprehensive investigation of contamination sources, including detailed assessment of nearby industrial operations

### Long-term Monitoring

1. **Groundwater Monitoring:** Establish permanent monitoring well network to track contamination plume movement

2. **Regular Testing:** Implement quarterly testing of all remaining municipal wells for volatile organic compounds

3. **Industrial Oversight:** Recommend enhanced oversight of industrial waste disposal practices in the watershed area

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All closure procedures have been conducted in accordance with:
- Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 160
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health Regulations 310 CMR 22.00
- Town of Woburn Well Construction and Abandonment Ordinances

Required notifications have been submitted to:
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health
- Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering  
- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region I

## CONCLUSION

The closure of Wells G and H represents a significant loss of municipal water production capacity but was necessary to protect public health. The detection of industrial solvents at levels substantially exceeding safe drinking water standards indicates serious groundwater contamination that likely developed over an extended period during the wells' operational life.

The proximity of major industrial operations utilizing and disposing of the detected chemicals suggests potential liability issues that warrant immediate legal review. The city should consider all available remedies to address both the contamination source and the substantial costs associated with developing replacement water supplies.

This closure marks the end of a fifteen-year period during which thousands of residents unknowingly consumed contaminated water. The full extent of potential health impacts remains to be determined through ongoing epidemiological investigation.
