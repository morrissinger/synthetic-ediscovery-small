## CHIEF COMPLAINT

Patient presented to emergency department with mother reporting severe nosebleeds and spontaneous bruising that began approximately 48 hours prior to admission. Mother states this represents a significant change from patient's baseline health status.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carl Robbins III is a 12-year-old male who was brought to the emergency department by his mother, Donna Robbins, due to concerning bleeding episodes. According to Mrs. Robbins, the patient experienced his first severe nosebleed on June 1, 1981, at approximately 11:30 PM. The bleeding lasted for over 45 minutes and required direct pressure and ice application before subsiding. On June 2, the patient developed multiple bruises on his arms and legs without any reported trauma or physical activity that would explain their appearance.

This morning, June 3, the patient experienced another prolonged nosebleed lasting approximately 30 minutes, accompanied by what the mother describes as "unusual fatigue" and pale coloration. Mrs. Robbins reports that Carl has been drinking municipal water from their home tap throughout his life, and the family has resided at their current address since 1967. She specifically mentioned concern about recent discussions in the neighborhood regarding water quality issues.

The patient has no significant past medical history of bleeding disorders, and there is no family history of hemophilia or other coagulopathies. Mrs. Robbins reports that Carl has been previously healthy with normal childhood development and regular attendance at Woburn Middle School.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

**Vital Signs:**
- Temperature: 99.2°F (37.3°C)
- Heart Rate: 108 beats per minute
- Blood Pressure: 95/60 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths per minute
- Weight: 78 pounds (35.4 kg)
- Height: 4 feet 8 inches (142 cm)

**General Appearance:** Alert 12-year-old male appearing pale and somewhat fatigued but in no acute distress. Patient cooperative with examination.

**Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat:** Notable pallor of conjunctiva and mucous membranes. Evidence of recent epistaxis with dried blood in nasal passages. No active bleeding observed during examination. Throat examination reveals pale mucosa but no petechiae.

**Cardiovascular:** Heart rate elevated but regular rhythm. No murmurs detected. Capillary refill time prolonged at 4 seconds.

**Pulmonary:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No respiratory distress.

**Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated on palpation.

**Extremities:** Multiple ecchymoses noted on bilateral arms and legs, ranging in size from 2-5 centimeters. Bruises appear to be in various stages of healing. No joint swelling or deformity.

**Skin:** Generalized pallor. Multiple bruises as noted above. No rash or petechiae observed.

**Lymphatic:** No palpable lymphadenopathy in cervical, axillary, or inguinal regions.

## LABORATORY RESULTS

**Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
- White Blood Cell Count: 3,200/μL (Normal: 4,500-11,000/μL) **LOW**
- Red Blood Cell Count: 2.8 million/μL (Normal: 4.0-5.2 million/μL) **LOW**
- Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL (Normal: 11.5-14.5 g/dL) **CRITICALLY LOW**
- Hematocrit: 21% (Normal: 35-43%) **CRITICALLY LOW**
- Platelet Count: 45,000/μL (Normal: 150,000-400,000/μL) **CRITICALLY LOW**
- Mean Corpuscular Volume: 82 fL (Normal: 80-100 fL)

**Coagulation Studies:**
- Prothrombin Time (PT): 14.2 seconds (Normal: 11-13 seconds) **ELEVATED**
- Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT): 38 seconds (Normal: 25-35 seconds) **ELEVATED**

**Basic Metabolic Panel:**
- All values within normal limits for age

## ASSESSMENT AND CLINICAL IMPRESSION

**Primary Diagnosis:** Severe pancytopenia with bleeding tendency, etiology undetermined

**Differential Diagnosis:**
1. **Acute leukemia** - Most concerning given the constellation of findings including pancytopenia, bleeding, and fatigue
2. **Aplastic anemia** - Possible given the low counts across all cell lines
3. **Toxic exposure** - Environmental or chemical exposure causing bone marrow suppression
4. **Viral syndrome** - Though less likely given severity of findings

## CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The laboratory findings are extremely concerning and represent a medical emergency requiring immediate hematologic evaluation. The combination of severe anemia (hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets 45,000/μL), and leukopenia (WBC 3,200/μL) constitutes pancytopenia, which in a previously healthy 12-year-old male raises immediate concern for acute leukemia or severe bone marrow failure.

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
1. Patient admitted to pediatric unit for urgent hematologic workup
2. Type and crossmatch for potential blood transfusion
3. Bleeding precautions instituted
4. Pediatric hematology consultation requested for tomorrow morning

**Recommended Follow-up Studies:**
1. **Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration** - Essential to determine etiology of pancytopenia
2. **Peripheral blood smear review** by hematopathologist
3. **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)** and **uric acid levels**
4. **Comprehensive metabolic panel** including liver function tests
5. **Viral studies** including EBV, CMV, and hepatitis panel

## ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS

Given the patient's residence in Woburn and recent community concerns regarding water quality, I recommend documentation of potential environmental exposures. Mrs. Robbins should be questioned regarding:
- Duration of residence at current address
- Primary source of drinking water (municipal vs. private well)
- Any known industrial facilities in the area
- Other family members with similar symptoms

This information may be relevant for public health authorities and should be forwarded to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health if additional cases are identified in the community.

## PROGNOSIS AND FAMILY COMMUNICATION

Mrs. Robbins has been informed of the serious nature of Carl's condition and the need for immediate specialist evaluation. The findings suggest a significant hematologic disorder requiring urgent investigation and treatment. Family has been counseled regarding the need for hospitalization and the planned diagnostic workup.

**Follow-up:** Patient will remain hospitalized pending hematology consultation and bone marrow biopsy results. Family will be updated as additional information becomes available.
