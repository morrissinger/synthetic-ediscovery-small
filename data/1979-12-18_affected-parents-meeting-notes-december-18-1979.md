## Opening Discussion

Anne called the meeting to order at 7:30 PM. She began by reading from the letter we all received from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health dated December 10th regarding the "preliminary findings" of their investigation into the childhood leukemia cases in our neighborhood.

**Key points from the state letter:**
- They acknowledge "an unusual clustering" of childhood leukemia cases
- Eight confirmed cases in children under 15 since 1964
- All cases within a 1-mile radius of Wells G and H
- They're calling it "statistically significant" but won't commit to causation

Anne pointed out what we all know - this is our children they're talking about like statistics. Jimmy died in January. These aren't numbers on a chart.

## Water Testing Results Discussion

Bob Zona brought copies of the water test results that the city finally released last week. The numbers are staggering:

**Wells G and H Contamination Levels (May 1979 testing):**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 267 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 21 parts per billion
- Chloroform: 12 parts per billion
- Other organic compounds detected but not quantified

Bob explained that the EPA recommended maximum for TCE is 50 ppb. Our wells had over 5 times that amount.

Charles Toomey asked the question we're all thinking: "How long have they known about this?" The wells were shut down in May, but when did they first suspect contamination? Patrick has been sick since 1977. Kevin Jr. was diagnosed in 1978. Were our kids drinking poison while the city knew there might be a problem?

## Industrial Sources Discussion

We spent considerable time discussing what we know about the companies operating near the wells:

**W.R. Grace/Cryovac (369 Washington Street):**
- Carl Robbins Jr. mentioned his brother-in-law works there
- They use massive amounts of solvents for cleaning machinery
- Multiple neighbors have reported strong chemical odors coming from the facility
- The facility sits directly upstream from Wells G and H

**Beatrice Foods/Riley Tannery (228 Salem Street):**
- Marie Gamache's father worked there in the 1960s
- He always talked about the "chemical smell" and how they dumped waste behind the building
- The tannery has been operating since the 1950s using chromium and other chemicals
- Located southwest of the wells, also in the watershed

Roland Sr. brought up something important - his neighbor saw trucks dumping barrels behind the Grace property in the early 1970s. We need to document these observations.

## Health Patterns and Timeline

We went through each of our children's cases to look for patterns:

**Timeline of Diagnoses:**
- 1972: First case (neighbor's child, moved away)
- 1974: Two cases 
- 1975: One case
- 1977: Patrick Toomey diagnosed
- 1978: Kevin Kane Jr. diagnosed, Carl Robbins III diagnosed
- 1979: Michael Zona diagnosed, Roland Gamache Jr. diagnosed, Jimmy Anderson died in January

**Common factors we identified:**
- All families lived within 6 blocks of Wells G and H
- All children attended the same elementary school (Winn Brook)
- Most families moved to the neighborhood between 1964-1970 (when wells opened)
- Several mothers reported drinking large amounts of water during pregnancy (doctor's orders)
- Multiple families noticed metallic taste in water but were told it was "safe"

## Legal Discussion

Anne brought up the possibility of legal action. She's been in contact with a lawyer in Boston who specializes in personal injury cases. The lawyer told her we need to establish:

1. **Duty of Care:** Did these companies have a responsibility to dispose of waste safely?
2. **Breach of Duty:** Did they fail to meet that responsibility?
3. **Causation:** Can we prove their actions caused our children's illnesses?
4. **Damages:** The harm to our families

The challenge is proving causation. The companies will argue that leukemia has many causes and we can't prove it was their chemicals.

But we discussed the evidence we're building:
- The timing matches perfectly with wells operation (1964-1979)
- The geographic clustering around the wells
- The contamination levels found in May
- The industrial sources using the exact chemicals found in our water

## Action Items

**Immediate Actions (by January 15, 1980):**
1. **Document Collection:** Each family will gather all medical records, water bills, and any correspondence with the city about water quality
2. **Neighbor Interviews:** We'll systematically interview neighbors about water taste, odors, and any observations of industrial dumping
3. **Historical Research:** Roland Sr. will check city records for permits issued to Grace and Beatrice for waste disposal
4. **Expert Consultation:** Anne will contact the lawyer again to discuss next steps

**Ongoing Documentation:**
- Keep detailed logs of any ongoing health issues in family members
- Save all correspondence with government agencies
- Document any conversations with company representatives or city officials

## Financial Considerations

We discussed the reality that legal action will be expensive. The companies we're up against have deep pockets and teams of lawyers. Anne suggested we might need to find an attorney willing to work on contingency - taking a percentage of any settlement rather than upfront fees.

Carl Jr. pointed out that even if we win, no amount of money will bring back Jimmy or cure our sick children. But maybe we can prevent this from happening to other families.

## Government Response

We're all frustrated with the slow response from authorities:

**Massachusetts Department of Public Health:**
- Took 6 months to acknowledge the cluster after Anne first contacted them
- Still won't commit to investigating the industrial sources
- Claiming they need "more data" before taking action

**EPA:**
- Referred us back to state authorities
- Won't investigate without a formal complaint
- Suggested we contact our congressman

**City of Woburn:**
- Shut down the wells but provided no explanation to affected families
- Refusing to release historical water testing data
- Mayor's office won't meet with us as a group

We decided to write a joint letter to Congressman Edward Markey requesting federal intervention.

## Emotional Support

Marie Gamache brought up something important - we're all dealing with tremendous stress and grief. Some of our children are still fighting for their lives. Others, like Jimmy, are gone forever.

We agreed to continue meeting monthly, not just for legal strategy but to support each other through this nightmare. No one else understands what we're going through.

Patricia Kane suggested we start a phone tree so we can quickly share information and support families during medical crises.

## Next Meeting

**Date:** January 15, 1980
**Time:** 7:30 PM  
**Location:** Kane family home, 47 Pine Street
**Agenda:** Review collected documentation, discuss legal consultation results, plan government outreach

## Personal Notes

As I write this, Kevin Jr. is upstairs sleeping after another round of chemotherapy. He's only 12 years old, and he's been through more pain than any child should endure. 

The hardest part is the uncertainty. We don't know if the treatment will work. We don't know if other children in the neighborhood will get sick. We don't know if the companies responsible will ever be held accountable.

But tonight, sitting with these other parents who are fighting the same battle, I felt something I haven't felt since this nightmare began - hope. Not hope that our children will be magically cured, but hope that we might get answers. Hope that we might get justice. Hope that
