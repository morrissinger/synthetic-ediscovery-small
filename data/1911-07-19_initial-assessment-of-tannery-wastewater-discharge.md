# INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF TANNERY WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PATTERNS

**Prepared for:** John J. Riley Company  
**Site Location:** 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts  
**Survey Date:** July 15-18, 1911  
**Report Date:** July 19, 1911  
**Surveyor:** William Patterson, Civil Engineer  

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

At the request of Mr. John J. Riley, proprietor of the John J. Riley Company tannery operation, I have conducted a preliminary assessment of wastewater discharge patterns from the leather processing facility located at 228 Salem Street in East Woburn, Massachusetts. This survey was undertaken to document current disposal practices and evaluate the efficiency of existing drainage systems in handling the volume of process water generated by daily tannery operations.

The assessment reveals that the facility currently processes approximately 200-300 animal hides per week, generating substantial quantities of wastewater containing dissolved organic matter, tanning chemicals, and suspended solids. Current disposal methods rely primarily on direct discharge to surface drainage channels that ultimately connect to the Aberjona River system.

## SITE DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The Riley Tannery occupies approximately 2.3 acres of industrial property in the eastern section of Woburn, positioned between the Boston & Maine Railroad tracks to the west and the Aberjona River floodplain to the east. The facility consists of the main processing building (constructed 1909), two smaller outbuildings for hide storage and finishing operations, and an open-air lime pit area located on the southern portion of the property.

The topography slopes gently eastward toward the Aberjona River at a gradient of approximately 2-3 degrees. Soil conditions consist primarily of sandy loam overlying clay deposits, with seasonal groundwater encountered at depths ranging from 8 to 12 feet below surface grade. The proximity to the river ensures adequate drainage during normal precipitation conditions, though standing water has been observed in low-lying areas during periods of heavy rainfall.

## METHODOLOGY

This assessment employed direct observation and measurement techniques over a four-day period from July 15-18, 1911. Daily visits were conducted during peak processing hours (7:00 AM to 5:00 PM) to document wastewater generation patterns and discharge volumes. Measurements were taken using graduated containers and flow estimation methods appropriate to the scale of operations.

Water samples were collected from three locations: (1) the main discharge point adjacent to the processing building, (2) the lime pit drainage outlet, and (3) the combined outfall where facility drainage enters the natural surface water system. Visual and olfactory characteristics were recorded for each sample location.

## CURRENT DISCHARGE PATTERNS

### Primary Processing Discharge

The main tannery building generates the largest volume of wastewater, estimated at 800-1,200 gallons per day during normal operations. This discharge originates from hide washing, dehairing processes, and the initial stages of chemical treatment. The wastewater exhibits a dark brown coloration with a strong organic odor characteristic of decomposing animal matter.

Current disposal involves direct discharge through a 6-inch cast iron pipe that outlets approximately 50 feet east of the main building. The discharge flows across open ground for approximately 200 feet before entering a natural depression that connects to seasonal drainage patterns leading toward the Aberjona River.

### Lime Pit Drainage

The lime pit operation, essential for hide preparation, produces periodic discharges of highly alkaline water containing dissolved lime and organic residues. Volume varies significantly based on weather conditions and processing schedules, ranging from minimal flow during dry periods to substantial runoff following precipitation events.

Drainage from this area follows surface contours eastward, creating temporary pools and saturated soil conditions in the immediate vicinity. The alkaline nature of this discharge has resulted in visible vegetation damage in the immediate drainage path, with grass and small shrubs showing signs of chemical stress.

### Combined Outfall Characteristics

The combined discharge from all facility operations eventually converges approximately 400 feet east of the main building, where it enters what appears to be a natural watercourse that flows northeast toward the Aberjona River. At this point, the combined flow exhibits:

- **Volume:** Estimated 1,000-1,500 gallons per day during active processing
- **Color:** Dark brown to black, with occasional reddish tinting
- **Odor:** Strong organic smell detectable from distances up to 100 feet
- **Visible solids:** Suspended particles and occasional floating organic matter
- **pH characteristics:** Alkaline reaction noted in field testing

## OBSERVATIONS AND FINDINGS

### Soil and Groundwater Conditions

Extended observation reveals that wastewater discharge has created areas of persistently saturated soil extending 150-200 feet from the main discharge points. During the survey period, standing water was observed in several low-lying areas, suggesting that soil absorption capacity may be exceeded during periods of heavy discharge.

Test holes excavated to depths of 6-8 feet revealed discolored soil layers and strong chemical odors at depths of 3-4 feet below surface grade. This suggests that discharged materials are penetrating beyond surface drainage and may be affecting subsurface soil conditions.

### Surface Water Impact

Visual inspection of the natural watercourse receiving facility discharge reveals clear evidence of ongoing contamination. The streambed exhibits dark sediment deposits, and aquatic vegetation appears stunted or absent in areas directly downstream from the discharge point. Water in this channel maintains a brownish coloration and distinctive odor for distances exceeding 1,000 feet downstream.

### Seasonal Variations

Based on discussions with facility personnel and observations of existing conditions, discharge patterns vary significantly with seasonal processing schedules and weather conditions. Spring and fall represent peak processing periods, with correspondingly higher wastewater volumes. Winter operations are reduced, though the frozen ground conditions during cold months may alter drainage patterns and increase surface runoff.

## DRAINAGE EFFICIENCY ASSESSMENT

The current disposal system demonstrates adequate capacity for handling routine discharge volumes under normal weather conditions. However, several factors suggest potential limitations:

1. **Soil Saturation:** Extended periods of discharge have created persistently wet conditions that may indicate approaching soil absorption limits.

2. **Surface Pooling:** Standing water observed during the survey period suggests that drainage capacity may be exceeded during peak processing or wet weather.

3. **Downstream Flow:** The natural watercourse receiving discharge shows signs of reduced flow capacity due to sediment accumulation and vegetation impacts.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Short-Term Measures

1. **Discharge Monitoring:** Implement regular observation of discharge volumes and characteristics to identify peak loading periods and potential system overloads.

2. **Drainage Maintenance:** Clear accumulated sediments and organic matter from existing drainage channels to maintain flow capacity.

3. **Settling Basin:** Consider construction of a temporary settling basin near the main discharge point to allow suspended solids to precipitate before discharge to natural drainage.

### Long-Term Considerations

1. **Expanded Disposal Capacity:** As processing volumes increase, additional drainage infrastructure may be required to handle expanded wastewater flows.

2. **Alternative Disposal Methods:** Investigation of alternative disposal locations or methods may prove beneficial as the facility expands operations.

3. **Seasonal Adjustments:** Development of procedures for managing discharge during wet weather periods when natural drainage capacity is reduced.

## CONCLUSIONS

The current wastewater disposal system at the Riley Tannery operates within acceptable parameters for the scale and nature of existing operations. The natural drainage patterns and soil conditions provide adequate capacity for routine discharge volumes, and the proximity to the Aberjona River ensures ultimate disposal of processed wastewater.

However, continued monitoring of discharge patterns and drainage efficiency will be essential as operations expand. The industrial nature of the discharge and its chemical characteristics require ongoing attention to ensure that disposal practices remain appropriate for the local environmental conditions.

The facility's location and drainage patterns are well-suited to leather processing operations, and with proper management of discharge volumes and timing, the current disposal system should continue to provide effective wastewater handling for the foreseeable future.
