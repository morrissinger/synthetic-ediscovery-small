# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Water Department Staff  
**FROM:** City Engineer  
**DATE:** May 10, 1979  
**RE:** Well Facility Closure Notice Installation - Washington Street Wellheads

## Immediate Action Required - Wells G and H

Following the preliminary test results received from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory on May 8, 1979, this office is directing the immediate installation of closure notices at municipal Wells G and H located on Washington Street in East Woburn. The volatile organic compound testing conducted as part of our routine water quality monitoring program has revealed contamination levels that exceed acceptable standards for public water supply.

**Effective immediately, all personnel are directed to:**

1. **Post closure notices** at both wellhead facilities using the standardized Department of Public Health warning placards
2. **Secure all pumping equipment** and ensure electrical disconnection procedures are properly documented
3. **Redirect water supply distribution** to rely on remaining municipal sources, with particular attention to maintaining adequate pressure in the eastern service areas
4. **Document all closure activities** in the daily operations log with time stamps and personnel signatures

The contamination appears to be related to industrial solvent compounds, specifically trichloroethylene and related chlorinated hydrocarbons. While we await complete analytical results from the state laboratory, the preliminary findings indicate levels substantially above the recommended safety thresholds established by federal guidelines. Wells G and H have been operational since 1964 and 1966 respectively, serving approximately 5,000 residents in the eastern neighborhoods of the city.

This closure is being implemented as a precautionary measure pending a comprehensive investigation by state environmental authorities. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has been notified of our actions and will be coordinating with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding potential sources of contamination in the Aberjona River Valley aquifer system. Given the proximity of industrial facilities along Washington Street, including the W.R. Grace Company operations and the Riley tannery facility, a thorough assessment of groundwater migration patterns will be necessary.

All department personnel should be prepared to address citizen inquiries regarding water service interruptions or quality concerns. Direct all media contacts to the City Manager's office. A public notice will be issued through appropriate channels once the complete analytical results are available and reviewed by municipal counsel.

**Contact the City Engineer's office immediately if you observe any unusual conditions at the wellhead sites or receive reports of water quality issues from residents in the affected service areas.**
