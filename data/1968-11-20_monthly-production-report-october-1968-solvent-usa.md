# MONTHLY PRODUCTION REPORT
## October 1968 Solvent Usage Analysis

**TO:** Thomas J. Carlisle, Plant Director  
**FROM:** Robert F. Henderson, Operations Manager  
**DATE:** November 20, 1968  
**RE:** October Production Summary and Solvent Utilization Review

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the October 1968 production results for Cryovac Inc.'s Woburn facility, with particular emphasis on solvent usage patterns and disposal methodologies. Total production volume reached 847,300 linear feet of packaging film, representing a 12% increase over September figures and maintaining our trajectory toward the revised annual targets established in the third quarter review.

Solvent consumption for October totaled 18,750 gallons across all production lines, consisting primarily of trichloroethylene (TCE) for degreasing operations and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) for cleaning processes. This represents efficient utilization within acceptable variance parameters, though disposal logistics continue to require careful management given increased production volumes.

## PRODUCTION OVERVIEW

### Manufacturing Output
- **Total Linear Footage Produced:** 847,300 feet
- **Primary Product Lines:** Shrink-wrap packaging films, industrial barrier materials
- **Operating Days:** 22 (excluding scheduled maintenance October 14-15)
- **Average Daily Production:** 38,513 feet
- **Production Efficiency Rating:** 94.2%

The October production schedule maintained consistent output across all three manufacturing lines. Line A operated at 96% capacity, producing premium shrink-wrap materials for food packaging applications. Line B achieved 93% efficiency while transitioning between product specifications for our expanded industrial client base. Line C, our newest installation, performed at 93.5% capacity as operators continue to optimize settings for maximum throughput.

Quality control metrics remained within acceptable parameters throughout the reporting period. Rejection rates averaged 2.3%, primarily due to thickness variations during the October 8-10 period when humidity levels exceeded optimal ranges. These materials were successfully reprocessed without significant impact on delivery schedules.

### Staffing and Operations
Total workforce averaged 127 employees during October, including 89 production workers, 23 maintenance and technical staff, and 15 administrative personnel. Overtime hours totaled 340 across all departments, primarily concentrated during the final week to meet accelerated delivery commitments for several major accounts.

Safety performance remained satisfactory with no reportable incidents during the month. Monthly safety training sessions were conducted October 3rd and 17th, focusing on proper handling procedures for cleaning solvents and emergency response protocols.

## SOLVENT USAGE ANALYSIS

### Consumption Breakdown
**Trichloroethylene (TCE):**
- Total consumption: 11,250 gallons
- Primary applications: Metal degreasing, equipment cleaning
- Cost per gallon: $0.47
- Total monthly cost: $5,287.50

**Tetrachloroethylene (PCE):**
- Total consumption: 4,850 gallons
- Primary applications: Precision cleaning, final rinse operations
- Cost per gallon: $0.52
- Total monthly cost: $2,522.00

**Miscellaneous Solvents:**
- Total consumption: 2,650 gallons
- Applications: Specialized cleaning, maintenance operations
- Total monthly cost: $1,456.75

The increased solvent consumption reflects expanded production volumes and additional cleaning cycles required for maintaining quality standards on the new product lines. Usage rates per unit of production remain consistent with established benchmarks, indicating efficient utilization of cleaning materials.

### Disposal Operations
Solvent disposal continues to be managed through established protocols developed in consultation with our chemical suppliers and in accordance with current regulations. Used solvents are collected in designated storage areas and processed through approved disposal methods.

During October, approximately 15,200 gallons of used solvents were processed for disposal. The majority of this material was transported to approved off-site facilities, while a portion was managed through on-site treatment processes that have proven effective in reducing disposal volumes and associated costs.

Our disposal contractor, Industrial Waste Management Inc., maintained regular pickup schedules throughout the month. Their representative conducted the quarterly inspection on October 25th and confirmed that our storage and handling procedures meet current regulatory requirements.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

The facility continues to operate within all applicable environmental guidelines. Monthly monitoring of air quality parameters was completed October 30th by Environmental Testing Associates, with all measurements falling within acceptable limits established by state and federal authorities.

Ground conditions around the facility remain stable, with no observable changes in soil or drainage patterns. The recent installation of additional monitoring wells as part of our expanded environmental compliance program provides enhanced oversight of subsurface conditions.

Waste minimization efforts implemented during the third quarter continue to show positive results. Solvent recovery processes have improved efficiency by approximately 8% compared to the same period last year, reducing both disposal costs and environmental impact.

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND FORWARD PLANNING

### Operational Improvements
1. **Equipment Optimization:** Recommend scheduling comprehensive maintenance for Line B during the December shutdown period to address minor efficiency variations observed during October.

2. **Inventory Management:** Current solvent storage capacity appears adequate for projected November-December usage, though consideration should be given to expanding storage capabilities in advance of first quarter 1969 production increases.

3. **Quality Control Enhancement:** Propose installation of additional humidity control systems to minimize weather-related production variations during winter months.

### Cost Management
October solvent costs totaled $9,266.25, representing 3.2% of total production costs. This figure remains within budgeted parameters, though continued monitoring will be necessary as production volumes increase through year-end.

Disposal costs averaged $0.23 per gallon of used solvent, consistent with contracted rates. Negotiations with our primary disposal contractor for 1969 rates should commence in December to ensure continued cost-effective waste management.

### Environmental Compliance
Recommend scheduling the annual environmental compliance review for January 1969 to ensure continued adherence to all applicable regulations. This review should include assessment of disposal procedures, storage protocols, and monitoring systems.

The facility's environmental management practices continue to meet or exceed current regulatory requirements. Regular consultation with environmental specialists ensures that our operations remain in full compliance with evolving standards in this area.

## CONCLUSION

October production results demonstrate continued operational excellence and efficient resource utilization. Solvent usage patterns reflect appropriate consumption levels for current production volumes, while disposal operations maintain compliance with all applicable regulations.

The facility is well-positioned to meet fourth quarter targets while maintaining the high standards of safety and environmental responsibility that characterize Cryovac's operations. Continued focus on operational efficiency and cost management will support achievement of annual objectives.

I recommend approval of the proposed equipment maintenance schedule and authorization to proceed with storage capacity evaluation for 1969 planning purposes.
