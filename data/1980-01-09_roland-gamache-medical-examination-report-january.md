**CHIEF COMPLAINT**

Patient presents with persistent fatigue, intermittent fever, and recurrent nosebleeds over the past three months. Parents report decreased appetite, weight loss, and complaints of bone pain, particularly in legs and back. Child appears pale and has been increasingly lethargic according to parental observation.

---

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**

Roland is a previously healthy 7-year-old male who began experiencing symptoms in October 1979. Initial complaints were of general malaise and occasional low-grade fever (99-100°F). Parents initially attributed symptoms to seasonal illness, but condition has progressively worsened. Over the past six weeks, patient has experienced:

- Daily fatigue requiring afternoon naps (unusual for patient)
- Spontaneous nosebleeds occurring 2-3 times weekly
- Intermittent fever spikes reaching 101°F
- Loss of appetite with 8-pound weight loss since October
- Complaints of aching in long bones, particularly at night
- Increased susceptibility to minor infections
- Bruising that appears excessive for normal childhood activity

Parents report that Roland has been drinking municipal tap water exclusively, as family resides in East Woburn area served by Wells G and H until their closure in May 1979. Since well closure, family has been receiving water from alternate municipal sources.

**LABORATORY RESULTS ORDERED**

Given the constellation of symptoms and physical findings, I have ordered the following laboratory studies to be performed immediately:

- Complete Blood Count with differential
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
- Liver function tests
- Coagulation studies (PT/PTT)
- Bone marrow aspiration (if CBC abnormal)

**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**

**Primary Concern:** 
The clinical presentation of fatigue, weight loss, fever, spontaneous bleeding, splenomegaly, and multiple ecchymoses in a previously healthy child raises significant concern for hematologic malignancy, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
1. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (most likely)
2. Aplastic anemia
3. Other hematologic malignancies
4. Severe viral illness with secondary thrombocytopenia

**Immediate Plan:**
1. STAT laboratory studies as outlined above
2. Urgent pediatric hematology/oncology consultation
3. Consider immediate hospitalization pending laboratory results
4. Supportive care including fever management and bleeding precautions
5. Family education regarding signs requiring immediate medical attention

**Follow-up:**
Patient and family to return immediately upon completion of laboratory studies. If CBC reveals significant abnormalities consistent with leukemia, immediate referral to Children's Hospital Boston for further evaluation and treatment initiation.

**Prognosis:**
Pending laboratory confirmation, but clinical presentation suggests serious hematologic condition requiring immediate subspecialty intervention and aggressive treatment.

**PHYSICIAN NOTES**

This case represents the fourth child from the East Woburn area that I have examined in the past eight months with similar presenting symptoms. All previous cases have been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Given the geographic clustering and the recent closure of municipal Wells G and H due to chemical contamination, I am documenting this potential correlation for future epidemiologic review.

Parents have been advised of the serious nature of Roland's condition and the need for immediate further evaluation. They have expressed understanding and consent to the proposed diagnostic workup and referrals.
