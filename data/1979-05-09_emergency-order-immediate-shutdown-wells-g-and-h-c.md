# EMERGENCY ORDER FOR IMMEDIATE SHUTDOWN
## MUNICIPAL WELLS G AND H - CHEMICAL CONTAMINATION

**TO:** Massachusetts Department of Public Health  
**FROM:** Office of the Mayor, City of Woburn  
**DATE:** May 9, 1979  
**FILING NO:** MDPH-79-0509-EMERGENCY  
**REGULATORY AUTHORITY:** M.G.L. Chapter 111, Section 160; 310 CMR 22.00

---

## I. EMERGENCY DECLARATION AND IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

The City of Woburn hereby submits this emergency regulatory filing pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 160, and applicable regulations under 310 CMR 22.00, requesting immediate Department review and concurrence with the emergency shutdown of municipal Wells G and H, located in East Woburn, effective immediately upon receipt of this filing.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION TAKEN:** As of 4:00 PM this date, May 9, 1979, the City of Woburn has ordered the immediate cessation of all pumping operations at Wells G and H and the isolation of these water sources from the municipal distribution system. This emergency action has been taken based on preliminary analytical results indicating the presence of volatile organic compounds in concentrations that may pose an immediate threat to public health and safety.

## II. FACTUAL BASIS FOR EMERGENCY ACTION

### A. Well Identification and Operational History

**Well G:** Municipal Water Supply Well  
- Location: East Woburn, Middlesex County  
- Coordinates: Latitude 42°30'15"N, Longitude 71°09'42"W  
- Installation Date: 1964  
- Depth: 180 feet  
- Average Daily Pumping Capacity: 400,000 gallons  
- Service Area: Eastern Woburn residential neighborhoods

**Well H:** Municipal Water Supply Well  
- Location: East Woburn, Middlesex County  
- Coordinates: Latitude 42°30'08"N, Longitude 71°09'38"W  
- Installation Date: 1966  
- Depth: 165 feet  
- Average Daily Pumping Capacity: 350,000 gallons  
- Service Area: Eastern Woburn residential neighborhoods

Both wells have operated continuously since their installation, providing supplemental water supply to approximately 2,500 residential units in East Woburn, serving an estimated population of 8,000 residents.

### B. Chemical Contamination Discovery

On May 7, 1979, routine water quality testing conducted by the Woburn Department of Public Works revealed the presence of volatile organic compounds in water samples from both Wells G and H. Preliminary analysis conducted by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority laboratory indicates the following contaminants:

**Well G Sample Results (May 7, 1979):**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 267 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 21 parts per billion
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 85 parts per billion
- Chloroform: 12 parts per billion

**Well H Sample Results (May 7, 1979):**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE): 183 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE): 56 parts per billion
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 42 parts per billion
- Chloroform: 8 parts per billion

These concentrations substantially exceed acceptable levels for public water supply and represent an immediate threat to public health requiring emergency intervention.

### C. Potential Sources of Contamination

Preliminary investigation has identified several industrial facilities within the groundwater recharge area that may have contributed to the contamination of the aquifer serving Wells G and H:

1. **W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc.**
   - Address: 369 Washington Street, East Woburn
   - Operations: Packaging machinery manufacturing
   - Chemical Usage: Trichloroethylene, industrial solvents
   - Location: Northeast of Wells G and H, within Aberjona River Valley

2. **Beatrice Foods Inc./John J. Riley Company**
   - Address: 228 Salem Street, Woburn
   - Operations: Leather tanning facility
   - Chemical Usage: Various industrial chemicals and solvents
   - Location: Southwest of Wells G and H

The proximity of these industrial operations to the municipal wells, combined with the specific chemical compounds detected, suggests a pattern of groundwater contamination resulting from industrial waste disposal practices.

## III. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS

The presence of volatile organic compounds in the municipal water supply poses serious health risks to the affected population. Trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are known carcinogens, and prolonged exposure through drinking water consumption may result in:

- Increased cancer risk, particularly leukemia and lymphomas
- Liver and kidney damage
- Central nervous system effects
- Reproductive and developmental disorders
- Immune system suppression

Of particular concern is the potential impact on children, who are more vulnerable to the effects of chemical exposure. The affected service area includes numerous families with young children who have been consuming contaminated water for an extended period.

## IV. LEGAL BASIS FOR EMERGENCY ACTION

### A. Municipal Authority

The City of Woburn exercises this emergency authority under:
- Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40, Section 41 (municipal water supply protection)
- Woburn City Charter, Article VII, Section 3 (emergency powers)
- Common law duty of care to protect public health and safety

### B. Regulatory Compliance

This emergency action is taken in compliance with:
- Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111, Section 160 (public health emergency powers)
- 310 CMR 22.00 (Massachusetts Drinking Water Regulations)
- Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq.

### C. Negligence and Duty of Care Considerations

The contamination of Wells G and H appears to result from the negligent disposal of industrial chemicals by one or more corporate entities operating within the groundwater recharge area. These entities owed a duty of care to the community to prevent contamination of the public water supply through proper handling and disposal of hazardous materials. The breach of this duty has created a public nuisance requiring immediate remediation.

## V. IMMEDIATE REMEDIAL MEASURES

The City of Woburn has implemented the following emergency measures:

1. **Immediate Well Shutdown:** All pumping operations at Wells G and H ceased at 4:00 PM, May 9, 1979
2. **System Isolation:** Wells G and H have been physically disconnected from the municipal distribution system
3. **Alternative Water Supply:** Emergency interconnection with neighboring municipal systems activated
4. **Public Notification:** Press release issued to local media advising residents of the emergency shutdown
5. **Health Advisory:** Coordination with local physicians regarding potential health impacts

## VI. REQUESTED DEPARTMENT ACTION

The City of Woburn respectfully requests that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health:

1. **Concur** with the emergency shutdown of Wells G and H
2. **Authorize** the continued closure of these wells pending comprehensive contamination assessment
3. **Direct** immediate epidemiological investigation of potential health impacts in the affected population
4. **Coordinate** with appropriate state and federal agencies for comprehensive site investigation
5. **Issue** emergency health advisory to affected residents
6. **Assist** in securing emergency funding for alternative water supply measures

## VII. ONGOING INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION

The City commits to the following actions pending Department review:

1. Comprehensive groundwater contamination assessment
2. Identification and notification of potentially responsible parties
3. Coordination with state and federal environmental agencies
4. Development of long-term remediation plan
5. Continued monitoring of alternative water supply sources
6. Regular reporting to the Department on remediation progress

## VIII. CERTIFICATION

I hereby certify that the information contained in this emergency filing is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that the emergency actions described herein have been taken in good faith to protect the public health and safety of the citizens of Woburn.
