# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Woburn Water Department  
**FROM:** Municipal Laboratory - Quality Control Division  
**DATE:** May 2, 1979  
**RE:** Chain of Custody Documentation for Water Samples WG-790502 and WH-790502

This memorandum serves to document the chain of custody procedures followed for water samples collected from Wells G and H on May 2, 1979, as part of the routine volatile organic compound testing protocol initiated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

## Sample Collection Details

**Sample WG-790502 (Well G):**
- Collection Date: May 2, 1979
- Collection Time: 08:15 hours
- Collected by: Robert Chen, Water Quality Technician
- Witness: Margaret Sullivan, DPW Inspector
- Sample Volume: 1000ml in sterile glass containers (4 x 250ml)
- Collection Method: Direct tap sampling after 5-minute purge
- Chain of Custody Form: WG-COC-790502

**Sample WH-790502 (Well H):**
- Collection Date: May 2, 1979
- Collection Time: 08:45 hours
- Collected by: Robert Chen, Water Quality Technician
- Witness: Margaret Sullivan, DPW Inspector
- Sample Volume: 1000ml in sterile glass containers (4 x 250ml)
- Collection Method: Direct tap sampling after 5-minute purge
- Chain of Custody Form: WH-COC-790502

Both samples were collected using standard EPA-approved sampling protocols for volatile organic analysis. Sample containers were pre-cleaned laboratory glass vials with Teflon-lined caps to prevent cross-contamination. All containers were labeled with waterproof ink indicating sample identification, date, time, and collector initials.

## Chain of Custody Transfer

The samples were transferred from field collection to laboratory custody at 09:30 hours on May 2, 1979. Laboratory Supervisor Dr. Patricia Morse accepted custody of both sample sets and verified seal integrity and documentation completeness. All chain of custody forms were properly executed with required signatures from collecting technician, witness, and receiving laboratory personnel.

Transportation from well sites to the Municipal Laboratory facility at 10 Common Street was conducted in sealed coolers maintained at 4°C. Transit time was approximately 30 minutes for both sample sets. No breaks in the cold chain were observed, and all custody seals remained intact upon laboratory receipt.

## Testing Protocol and Schedule

Both sample sets have been logged into the laboratory information system and assigned to the Organic Chemistry Section for volatile organic compound analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Testing will include screening for trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and other chlorinated solvents as specified in the Massachusetts DPH directive dated April 15, 1979.

Expected completion of analysis is May 9, 1979, with preliminary results available May 7, 1979. Final certified results will be forwarded to the Water Department within ten business days of sample receipt. All documentation will be maintained in laboratory files for a minimum of seven years in accordance with state regulatory requirements.

This chain of custody documentation ensures the legal admissibility and scientific integrity of the analytical results for samples WG-790502 and WH-790502. Any questions regarding these procedures should be directed to the Municipal Laboratory at extension 2847.
