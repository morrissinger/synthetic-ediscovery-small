## SAFETY INSPECTION REPORT

**TO:** W.R. Grace Safety Department  
**FROM:** Robert Martinez, Senior Safety Inspector  
**DATE:** November 12, 1970  
**RE:** Quarterly Safety Inspection - Cryovac Division, Woburn Facility  
**INSPECTION PERIOD:** November 9-11, 1970  
**FACILITY:** 15 Olympia Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents findings from the quarterly safety inspection of the Cryovac Division facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, conducted November 9-11, 1970. The inspection covered manufacturing operations, chemical storage areas, waste handling procedures, and employee safety protocols. While most operational areas meet current company safety standards, several areas require immediate attention to ensure continued compliance with applicable regulations and company policies.

## FACILITY OVERVIEW

The Cryovac facility operates as a specialized manufacturing division producing flexible packaging materials and related chemical products. Current operations include solvent-based adhesive production, plastic film manufacturing, and associated chemical processing activities. The facility employs approximately 180 workers across three shifts and maintains active production six days per week.

Manufacturing processes utilize various industrial solvents including trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and methylene chloride in significant quantities. These chemicals are essential to current production methods and are handled according to established company procedures.

## INSPECTION FINDINGS

### Manufacturing Operations

Production areas generally maintain acceptable safety standards. Ventilation systems in Buildings A and C are functioning within normal parameters. However, ventilation in Building B requires attention, as noted below. Workers demonstrate adequate knowledge of safety procedures for routine operations.

Chemical handling procedures in the adhesive production area follow established protocols. Employees utilize appropriate personal protective equipment during normal operations. Spill containment materials are readily available in designated areas.

### Chemical Storage and Handling

Chemical storage areas require immediate attention. The primary solvent storage area adjacent to Building B shows evidence of minor leakage from several containers. While quantities appear minimal, proper containment protocols must be reinforced.

Current inventory includes approximately 2,400 gallons of trichloroethylene, 1,800 gallons of perchloroethylene, and various quantities of other production chemicals. Storage containers are generally in acceptable condition, though several drums show minor surface corrosion requiring monitoring.

### Waste Management Procedures

Current waste disposal practices follow established company procedures. Chemical waste is segregated by type and stored in designated areas pending disposal. The waste storage area maintains adequate separation between incompatible materials.

Liquid waste disposal occurs through approved contractors on a regular schedule. Solid waste containing chemical residues is handled separately from general facility waste. Documentation of waste disposal activities is maintained in accordance with company requirements.

### Areas Requiring Attention

**Ventilation System - Building B:** The ventilation system in Building B shows reduced efficiency in the southwestern section. Air flow measurements indicate approximately 15% reduction from optimal levels. This condition may result in elevated chemical vapor concentrations during peak production periods.

**Recommendation:** Schedule immediate inspection and maintenance of ventilation equipment. Consider temporary production adjustments until full efficiency is restored.

**Ground-Level Drainage:** Surface drainage around the facility requires improvement. Standing water was observed in several areas following recent precipitation. This condition may affect proper runoff management and could impact chemical storage areas during severe weather.

**Recommendation:** Implement drainage improvements before winter weather conditions. Ensure proper grading around chemical storage areas.

**Employee Training Updates:** While current safety training meets basic requirements, enhanced training on chemical handling procedures would benefit overall safety performance. Several employees demonstrated uncertainty regarding emergency response procedures during routine questioning.

**Recommendation:** Schedule additional training sessions focusing on emergency response and chemical spill procedures.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Current operations appear consistent with applicable state and local regulations. The facility maintains required permits and documentation. Recent correspondence with state environmental authorities indicates continued compliance with reporting requirements.

Chemical usage reporting is current and accurate. Waste disposal documentation meets regulatory standards. Employee safety records demonstrate acceptable performance relative to industry standards.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - Repair ventilation system in Building B within 30 days
   - Address surface drainage issues before December 1970
   - Inspect and repair chemical storage containers showing corrosion

2. **Short-term Improvements (90 days):**
   - Implement enhanced employee training program
   - Upgrade chemical storage area containment systems
   - Review and update emergency response procedures

3. **Long-term Considerations:**
   - Evaluate alternative production methods to reduce solvent usage
   - Consider facility modifications to improve chemical handling efficiency
   - Develop comprehensive environmental monitoring program

## CONCLUSION

The Cryovac facility maintains generally acceptable safety standards for current operations. The identified deficiencies are manageable and do not pose immediate risks to employee safety or operational continuity when addressed promptly. Implementation of recommended improvements will enhance overall facility safety performance and ensure continued regulatory compliance.

Regular monitoring of corrective actions is recommended to ensure timely completion. The next quarterly inspection is scheduled for February 1971, with interim follow-up inspections as necessary to verify completion of required improvements.
