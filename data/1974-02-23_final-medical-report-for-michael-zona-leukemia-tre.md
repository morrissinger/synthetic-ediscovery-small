## PATIENT SUMMARY

This report serves as the final medical documentation for Michael Anthony Zona, an 8-year-old male who succumbed to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) on February 23, 1974, at 6:45 AM at his family residence. Michael had been under continuous care at Boston Children's Hospital since his initial diagnosis in June 1973, with supplementary treatment coordination through Massachusetts General Hospital's pediatric oncology service.

## MEDICAL HISTORY AND DIAGNOSIS

Michael first presented to our emergency department on June 18, 1973, accompanied by his mother, Mrs. Joan Zona, with complaints of persistent fatigue, unexplained bruising, and recurrent fevers spanning approximately six weeks. Initial physical examination revealed significant pallor, petechial rash across the trunk and extremities, and palpable lymphadenopathy in cervical and axillary regions. Laboratory studies demonstrated severe pancytopenia with a white blood cell count of 2,100/μL (normal range 4,500-13,500), hemoglobin of 6.2 g/dL (normal range 11.5-15.5), and platelet count of 18,000/μL (normal range 150,000-450,000).

Bone marrow aspiration performed on June 20, 1973, confirmed the diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia with greater than 95% lymphoblasts present. Cytochemical staining was consistent with L1 morphology according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification system. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed no evidence of central nervous system involvement at time of diagnosis.

## TREATMENT PROTOCOL AND CLINICAL COURSE

Michael was immediately enrolled in our standard ALL treatment protocol, which consisted of the following phases:

### Induction Phase (June-August 1973)
- Vincristine 1.5 mg/m² weekly for 4 weeks
- Prednisone 40 mg/m² daily for 28 days with gradual taper
- L-asparaginase 6,000 IU/m² three times weekly for 9 doses
- Intrathecal methotrexate for CNS prophylaxis

Michael achieved complete remission by day 28 of induction, with bone marrow showing less than 5% blasts and normalization of peripheral blood counts. However, he experienced significant treatment-related toxicity including severe mucositis, prolonged neutropenia requiring hospitalization for fever management, and hepatotoxicity with elevated liver enzymes.

### Consolidation Phase (September-November 1973)
- High-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue
- 6-mercaptopurine daily
- Continued intrathecal therapy

During this phase, Michael developed complications including severe gastrointestinal toxicity requiring nutritional support and multiple episodes of neutropenic fever requiring broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. His parents, particularly Mrs. Zona, demonstrated exceptional dedication to his care, maintaining detailed medication logs and symptom diaries that proved invaluable for treatment adjustments.

### Maintenance Phase (December 1973-February 1974)
- Daily 6-mercaptopurine
- Weekly methotrexate
- Monthly vincristine and prednisone pulses
- Periodic intrathecal therapy

## DISEASE PROGRESSION AND TERMINAL PHASE

Despite achieving initial remission, Michael experienced his first relapse in late December 1973, with bone marrow examination on December 28, 1973, revealing 68% lymphoblasts. Salvage therapy was initiated including:

- High-dose cytarabine
- Daunorubicin
- VP-16 (experimental protocol)
- Cranial irradiation (1800 cGy in 10 fractions)

Michael's condition continued to deteriorate throughout January and early February 1974. He developed progressive pancytopenia, recurrent infections, and increasing blast count in peripheral blood. By February 15, 1974, it became evident that curative therapy was no longer feasible, and focus shifted to palliative care measures.

## PAIN AND SUFFERING DOCUMENTATION

Throughout his illness, Michael experienced significant physical and emotional suffering that was carefully documented and treated:

**Physical Symptoms:**
- Chronic bone pain requiring regular narcotic analgesics
- Severe mucositis causing difficulty eating and speaking
- Recurrent infections leading to multiple hospitalizations
- Progressive weakness and fatigue limiting normal childhood activities
- Nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy requiring antiemetic medications
- Hair loss causing psychological distress
- Multiple painful procedures including bone marrow aspirations and lumbar punctures

**Psychological Impact:**
- Documented anxiety regarding medical procedures
- Depression noted by child psychology consultation
- Regression in developmental milestones
- Separation anxiety from family during hospitalizations
- Fear and confusion regarding his illness despite age-appropriate explanations

**Family Impact:**
The Zona family demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout Michael's illness. Mrs. Joan Zona maintained constant bedside presence during hospitalizations, often sleeping in hospital chairs for weeks at a time. The family incurred substantial financial hardship due to medical expenses, travel costs for treatment, and Mr. Pat Zona's missed work time. Siblings showed signs of stress and required counseling support through our social services department.

## FINAL HOSPITAL COURSE

Michael was discharged to home hospice care on February 18, 1974, when further aggressive intervention was deemed futile. Home nursing support was arranged through Visiting Nurse Association of Eastern Massachusetts. Pain management included morphine sulfate administered every 4 hours as needed, with breakthrough doses available.

On the morning of February 23, 1974, Mrs. Zona contacted our on-call service reporting that Michael had become increasingly lethargic overnight. I spoke with her at approximately 5:30 AM and advised comfort measures. Michael died peacefully at home at 6:45 AM with his family present.

## CAUSE OF DEATH

**Primary Cause:** Acute lymphocytic leukemia with relapsed/refractory disease  
**Contributing Factors:** Pancytopenia, immunosuppression, multi-organ failure secondary to leukemic infiltration

## MEDICAL EXPENSES AND DAMAGES

The total cost of Michael's medical care from diagnosis through death was substantial:

- Hospital charges: $18,450
- Physician fees: $3,200
- Medications: $2,890
- Radiation therapy: $1,150
- Laboratory and diagnostic studies: $1,680
- Home nursing care: $450
- **Total documented medical expenses: $27,820**

Additional non-medical costs incurred by the family included travel expenses, lodging during extended hospitalizations, and lost wages for both parents totaling an estimated $4,200.

## CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS

Michael's case represents a tragic example of childhood leukemia occurring in a previously healthy child with no known risk factors. Of particular note is the fact that Michael resided in the East Woburn area, which has been served by municipal wells since the mid-1960s. While no definitive environmental causation can be established through individual case analysis, the geographic clustering of pediatric leukemia cases in this specific area warrants further epidemiological investigation.

The aggressive nature of Michael's disease, combined with his young age at onset and the development of treatment-resistant relapse, resulted in a clinical course marked by significant pain and suffering over the 8-month period from diagnosis to death. Despite optimal medical management according to current standards of care, the disease proved uniformly fatal.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. The family should be provided with complete medical records for any future legal or administrative needs
