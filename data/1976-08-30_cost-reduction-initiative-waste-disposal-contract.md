# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Regional Director, Northeast Operations  
**FROM:** Richard H. Brennan, Plant Manager  
**DATE:** August 30, 1976  
**RE:** Cost Reduction Initiative - Waste Disposal Contract Termination

This memorandum documents the implementation of cost reduction measures at our Woburn facility, specifically regarding the termination of our contracted waste disposal services with Industrial Chemical Disposal Corporation effective September 15, 1976. This action aligns with corporate directives to reduce operational expenses by 12% for fiscal year 1977.

**Background and Rationale**

Our current disposal contract with ICDC requires monthly payments of $2,400 for removal and treatment of industrial solvents, including trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and various cleaning agents used in our manufacturing processes. Given the substantial volume of waste generated by our operations—approximately 800 drums monthly—these disposal costs represent a significant burden on plant profitability. After consultation with our production supervisors and review of alternative disposal methods, we have determined that on-site management of these materials will achieve the required cost savings while maintaining operational efficiency.

**Implementation Plan**

Beginning September 16, 1976, all industrial waste previously contracted for external disposal will be managed through our existing on-site systems. Liquid wastes will be directed to our settling ponds located in the rear section of the property, adjacent to the Aberjona River watershed. These ponds have proven adequate for containing various manufacturing byproducts and will accommodate the additional volume without requiring capital expenditure for expansion. Solid waste materials and contaminated equipment will be buried in designated areas of our property using existing earth-moving equipment, eliminating transportation costs and third-party disposal fees.

Our maintenance crew has identified several suitable locations for waste management activities, including the wooded area near the eastern property boundary and the low-lying section adjacent to the wetlands. These locations provide natural containment and are sufficiently removed from our main production areas to avoid interference with manufacturing operations. The proximity to groundwater sources should not present concerns, as natural soil filtration has historically managed any seepage from our operations without incident.

**Financial Impact**

This initiative will generate immediate cost savings of $28,800 annually, contributing significantly to our mandated expense reduction targets. Additional savings will accrue from eliminated transportation costs, reduced administrative overhead associated with disposal contractor management, and improved operational flexibility in waste handling schedules. These measures position our facility favorably for the upcoming budget review and demonstrate our commitment to corporate cost management objectives.

I have instructed our shift supervisors to implement these changes with minimal disruption to production schedules. All personnel involved in waste handling operations have been briefed on the new procedures and understand the importance of maintaining cost discipline while ensuring continued manufacturing output.

Please confirm receipt of this memorandum and advise if additional documentation is required for corporate records.
