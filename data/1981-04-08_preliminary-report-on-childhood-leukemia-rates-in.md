# Preliminary Report on Childhood Leukemia Rates in East Woburn Massachusetts

**Massachusetts Department of Public Health**  
Division of Communicable and Venereal Diseases  
150 Tremont Street  
Boston, Massachusetts 02111

**Report Number:** MDPH-81-0408  
**Classification:** Preliminary Assessment  
**Date:** April 8, 1981

## Executive Summary

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has conducted a preliminary epidemiological assessment of reported childhood leukemia cases in the East Woburn area following concerns raised by local residents. This report presents initial findings regarding the incidence of acute lymphocytic leukemia among children in census tracts served by municipal Wells G and H.

**Key Findings:**
- Observed leukemia incidence appears elevated compared to expected rates
- Geographic clustering identified in East Woburn residential areas
- Temporal pattern suggests cases concentrated between 1969-1981
- Municipal water supply serves affected area through Wells G and H

## Introduction

On February 12, 1981, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health received a formal inquiry from Mrs. Anne Anderson of 11 Orange Street, Woburn, requesting investigation into what she characterized as an unusual number of childhood leukemia cases in her neighborhood. Mrs. Anderson's son, James Anderson, died of acute lymphocytic leukemia on January 18, 1981, after a nine-year illness that began with his diagnosis in January 1972 at age three.

This preliminary assessment was initiated to determine whether the reported cases constitute a statistically significant cluster and to identify potential environmental factors that may warrant further investigation.

## Methodology

### Case Definition
- **Primary Case Definition:** Acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed in children under age 15
- **Geographic Boundary:** Census tracts 3371, 3372, and 3373 in East Woburn
- **Temporal Boundary:** January 1, 1969 through March 31, 1981
- **Data Sources:** Massachusetts Cancer Registry, hospital discharge records, death certificates

### Population Data
- **Study Area Population (1980 Census):** 5,010 residents
- **Children Under 15:** 1,247 (24.9% of total population)
- **Households Served by Wells G and H:** Approximately 1,850

### Statistical Analysis
Expected leukemia incidence calculated using Massachusetts age-adjusted rates for acute lymphocytic leukemia in children (3.4 cases per 100,000 children per year).

## Findings

### Case Identification

**Confirmed Cases (1969-1981):**

1. **James Anderson** - DOB: July 16, 1968; Address: 11 Orange Street
   - Diagnosis: January 1972 (age 3 years, 5 months)
   - Death: January 18, 1981 (age 12 years, 6 months)
   - Water source: Wells G and H

2. **Kevin Kane Jr.** - DOB: March 22, 1966; Address: 403 East Street
   - Diagnosis: August 1973 (age 7 years, 5 months)
   - Status: Deceased 1974
   - Water source: Wells G and H

3. **Michael Zona** - DOB: December 8, 1963; Address: 19 Maple Street
   - Diagnosis: September 1969 (age 5 years, 9 months)
   - Status: Deceased 1971
   - Water source: Wells G and H

4. **Patrick Toomey** - DOB: April 15, 1967; Address: 58 Pine Street
   - Diagnosis: March 1975 (age 7 years, 11 months)
   - Status: Under treatment
   - Water source: Wells G and H

5. **Carl Robbins III** - DOB: November 3, 1969; Address: 267 Montvale Avenue
   - Diagnosis: June 1976 (age 6 years, 7 months)
   - Status: Under treatment
   - Water source: Wells G and H

6. **Roland Gamache** - DOB: February 28, 1971; Address: 132 Salem Street
   - Diagnosis: October 1978 (age 7 years, 8 months)
   - Status: Under treatment
   - Water source: Wells G and H

### Statistical Analysis

**Expected vs. Observed Cases:**
- **Expected cases (1969-1981):** 1.8 cases
- **Observed cases:** 6 cases
- **Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR):** 3.33
- **95% Confidence Interval:** 1.22-7.25
- **P-value:** 0.018 (statistically significant)

The observed number of childhood leukemia cases is 3.33 times higher than expected based on Massachusetts state rates, with statistical significance at the p<0.05 level.

### Geographic Distribution

All confirmed cases reside within a 1.2-mile radius in East Woburn. The geographic distribution shows clustering along streets served by the municipal water distribution system connected to Wells G and H. No cases were identified in areas of Woburn served by alternative water sources.

**Well G:** Opened May 1964, located on Aberjona River floodplain  
**Well H:** Opened October 1966, located 300 yards northeast of Well G

### Temporal Pattern

Cases show temporal clustering with peak incidence between 1972-1976:
- 1969: 1 case
- 1972: 1 case  
- 1973: 1 case
- 1975: 1 case
- 1976: 1 case
- 1978: 1 case

## Environmental Considerations

### Water Supply System
The affected area receives municipal water from Wells G and H, which draw from the Aberjona River aquifer system. These wells serve approximately 1,850 households in East Woburn through the municipal distribution network.

### Industrial Activity
The study area is adjacent to several industrial facilities:
- W.R. Grace Company (Cryovac division) - Chemical manufacturing
- John J. Riley Company - Leather tanning operations  
- Beatrice Foods operations - Food processing

Historical industrial activities in the Aberjona River watershed include chemical manufacturing, leather processing, and waste disposal operations dating to the 1940s.

## Conclusions

This preliminary assessment identifies a statistically significant cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn, Massachusetts. The geographic and temporal distribution of cases, combined with the common water supply source, suggests the need for comprehensive environmental investigation.

**Key Findings:**
1. Childhood leukemia incidence is 3.33 times higher than expected
2. All cases are geographically clustered in areas served by Wells G and H
3. Temporal clustering suggests environmental exposure beginning in the late 1960s
4. Statistical significance supports designation as a disease cluster

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Water Quality Testing:** Comprehensive chemical analysis of Wells G and H for organic compounds, heavy metals, and known carcinogens
2. **Expanded Case Finding:** Active surveillance for additional leukemia cases in the study area
3. **Medical Record Review:** Detailed analysis of treatment records for identified cases

### Long-term Investigation
1. **Environmental Assessment:** Soil and groundwater contamination study in the Aberjona River watershed
2. **Industrial Source Investigation:** Historical review of waste disposal practices by area industries
3. **Epidemiological Study:** Expanded cohort study including other cancer types and birth defects

### Public Health Response
1. **Community Notification:** Public meeting to present findings to affected residents
2. **Medical Monitoring:** Enhanced surveillance for residents in the affected area
3. **Alternative Water Supply:** Evaluation of need for temporary alternative water sources pending investigation results

## Limitations

This preliminary report is based on limited data sources and represents initial findings only. Comprehensive environmental sampling and expanded epidemiological investigation are required to establish causation and identify specific exposure pathways.

The small number of cases limits statistical power for detailed subgroup analysis. Additional cases may exist that have not yet been identified through available data sources.
