## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This inspection report documents the current condition of undeveloped acreage areas on the Riley Tannery property at 228 Salem Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts, with particular attention to chemical waste disposal areas established during our forty-two years of leather processing operations. The inspection was conducted to assess the suitability of these areas for potential future development or alternative industrial use, as requested by management.

## SITE DESCRIPTION AND BOUNDARIES

The inspected area encompasses approximately 8.5 acres of undeveloped land situated on the western and southwestern portions of the Riley Tannery property. The area is bounded to the east by active tannery buildings and processing yards, to the west by the Boston & Maine Railroad tracks, to the north by Salem Street, and to the south by additional undeveloped acreage extending toward the Aberjona River wetlands.

The terrain consists of relatively flat to gently sloping ground with elevations ranging from approximately 102 feet above sea level near the railroad tracks to 96 feet above sea level in the southern sections approaching the river systems. Soil composition appears consistent with typical New England glacial deposits, consisting primarily of sandy loam with areas of clay subsoil observed in lower elevations.

## CHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL AREAS IDENTIFIED

### Area A: Northern Disposal Zone
**Location:** Approximately 200 feet southwest of main tannery building  
**Dimensions:** 150 feet × 80 feet  
**Depth:** Surface observations suggest disposal to depths of 4-6 feet

This area has been utilized for disposal of spent tanning liquors, lime solutions, and various organic solvents employed in leather processing operations since approximately 1920. Visual inspection reveals areas of discolored soil ranging from dark brown to black, with visible chemical staining extending across much of the disposal zone. Strong chemical odors are detectable, particularly in areas where recent rainfall has caused surface pooling.

The soil surface exhibits areas of sparse vegetation growth, with several zones showing complete absence of plant life. Chemical residues are visible as white crystalline deposits in several locations, likely indicating salt concentrations from tanning solutions. Surface water runoff from this area flows in a southeasterly direction toward lower-lying ground.

### Area B: Central Chemical Storage and Disposal Zone
**Location:** Central portion of undeveloped acreage, 300 feet from Salem Street  
**Dimensions:** 200 feet × 120 feet  
**Depth:** Estimated 6-8 feet based on disposal records

This zone has served as the primary disposal area for chromium-containing waste solutions, sulfuric acid residues, and various petroleum-based solvents since 1925. The area contains several depressions created by excavation for waste disposal, now partially filled with accumulated chemical residues and surface water.

Soil discoloration in this area is extensive, with characteristic blue-green staining consistent with chromium compounds observed throughout the zone. The distinctive metallic odor associated with chromium waste is readily detectable. Several areas show evidence of chemical precipitation, with visible crystalline formations on soil surfaces.

Of particular note is a depression approximately 40 feet in diameter in the eastern portion of Area B, which appears to contain standing liquid with an oily surface film. This liquid exhibits a strong petroleum-based odor and shows rainbow-colored surface reflections characteristic of hydrocarbon contamination.

### Area C: Southern Disposal and Drum Storage Area
**Location:** Southern boundary of property, adjacent to wetland areas  
**Dimensions:** 180 feet × 100 feet  
**Depth:** Variable, 3-10 feet

This area has been utilized for disposal of various chemical wastes and storage of empty chemical drums since 1930. Approximately 75 metal drums in various states of deterioration are currently present in this zone. Many drums show evidence of corrosion and leakage, with chemical staining visible around drum locations.

The proximity of this area to seasonal wetlands and the general drainage pattern toward the Aberjona River system is noted. Surface water flow during periods of high precipitation appears to carry material from this disposal area toward lower-lying wetland areas.

## SOIL AND GROUNDWATER OBSERVATIONS

Soil conditions throughout the inspected areas show significant alteration from natural conditions. Chemical staining is pervasive, with color variations including dark brown, black, blue-green, and reddish-brown discoloration extending to observable depths of 2-3 feet in areas where erosion or excavation has exposed subsurface materials.

Several areas show evidence of subsurface liquid accumulation, with chemical odors detectable from what appear to be saturated soil conditions approximately 4-6 feet below surface level. This suggests potential interaction between disposed chemicals and groundwater systems in the area.

The general groundwater flow direction in this area appears to be toward the southeast, based on topographical observations and the location of natural drainage features. This flow pattern would direct groundwater movement from the disposal areas toward the Aberjona River system and associated wetlands.

## VEGETATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

Vegetation growth throughout the inspected areas is significantly impacted, with large zones showing stunted growth, discoloration, or complete absence of plant life. Areas of normal vegetation growth are limited to elevated locations with apparent minimal chemical impact.

Tree growth along the perimeter of disposal areas shows evidence of stress, with several mature trees exhibiting dead or dying branches, discolored foliage, and reduced leaf coverage. Smaller vegetation shows more severe impacts, with many areas supporting only the most resistant plant species.

Wildlife activity in the inspected areas appears limited, with minimal evidence of normal animal activity such as burrows, nesting sites, or feeding areas typically observed in undeveloped land of this type.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATION

Based on the conditions observed during this inspection, the following recommendations are submitted for management consideration:

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Consolidation of deteriorating drum storage in Area C to prevent additional leakage
2. Installation of surface drainage controls to minimize chemical transport during precipitation events
3. Establishment of restricted access to disposal areas to prevent unauthorized entry

**Long-term Considerations:**
1. These areas should be considered unsuitable for residential or commercial development without extensive remediation
2. Any future industrial use should account for existing chemical contamination conditions
3. Monitoring of groundwater conditions may be advisable given the proximity to water resources

**Documentation:**
1. Detailed mapping of all disposal areas with precise boundary documentation
2. Maintenance of records regarding types and quantities of materials disposed in each area
3. Regular inspection schedule to monitor changes in disposal area conditions

## CONCLUSION

The undeveloped acreage areas of the Riley Tannery property contain extensive evidence of chemical waste disposal activities conducted over a thirty-year period. The conditions observed indicate significant alteration of natural soil and groundwater conditions through industrial waste disposal practices. While these areas have served the operational needs of the tannery business, their current condition presents limitations for alternative future uses.

The inspection findings document the successful utilization of available land resources for waste management purposes, consistent with standard industrial practices of the leather manufacturing sector. The chemical disposal areas represent an efficient use of available property for necessary waste management activities supporting our leather processing operations.
