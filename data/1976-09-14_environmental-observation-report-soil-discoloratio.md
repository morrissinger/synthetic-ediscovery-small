# ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATION REPORT

**TO:** Riley Tannery Supervisor  
**FROM:** Thomas Martinez, Site Foreman  
**DATE:** September 14, 1976  
**RE:** Soil Discoloration and Vegetation Death - East Property Line  

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

During routine morning inspection of the eastern perimeter of our Woburn facility at approximately 0800 hours on September 14, 1976, I observed significant environmental anomalies requiring immediate documentation and supervisory attention. The affected area encompasses approximately 200 square feet adjacent to our property line, extending from the rear loading dock area toward the residential properties on Montvale Road.

## DETAILED OBSERVATIONS

**Soil Conditions:**
The soil in the affected area displays pronounced discoloration, appearing dark brown to black in patches where normal soil should be light brown. The discolored areas emit a distinct chemical odor similar to the solvents used in our tanning operations. Surface moisture in these areas appears oily with a rainbow sheen characteristic of petroleum-based products. Soil consistency is notably different from surrounding areas - softer and more saturated despite recent dry weather conditions.

**Vegetation Impact:**
Grass and small shrubs within the affected zone show severe distress. Approximately 75% of vegetation displays yellowing, browning, or complete death. Several mature oak saplings that were healthy as recently as July now show significant leaf drop and bark discoloration. The vegetation death pattern appears to radiate outward from areas of most severe soil discoloration, suggesting a point source of contamination.

**Surface Water:**
Small puddles of standing water in the area display the same oily appearance noted in soil moisture. These puddles persist despite lack of recent precipitation and appear to be seeping from subsurface sources. Water color ranges from dark amber to nearly black.

## POTENTIAL CAUSES

Based on my fifteen years of experience at this facility, the observed conditions are consistent with chemical spillage or seepage from our operations. The proximity to our chemical storage area and the similarity of odors to our tanning solvents suggests possible connection to our waste disposal activities. Recent heavy usage of trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene in our cleaning operations may be relevant factors.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

I have cordoned off the affected area with temporary fencing to prevent personnel access and potential safety hazards. I have also instructed maintenance staff to avoid the area during routine grounds keeping activities. No remediation efforts have been initiated pending supervisory direction.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Assessment:** Engage qualified environmental consultant to assess extent and nature of contamination
2. **Source Investigation:** Conduct thorough review of chemical storage and disposal practices in adjacent facility areas  
3. **Documentation:** Photograph affected areas for company records
4. **Regulatory Consultation:** Consider notification to appropriate state environmental authorities
5. **Monitoring:** Establish regular inspection schedule to track progression of affected area

## ADDITIONAL CONCERNS

The affected area's proximity to residential properties raises potential liability concerns. Several homes on Montvale Road are located within 300 feet of the contaminated zone. Additionally, I am aware that municipal water wells G and H are located in the general vicinity, though I cannot determine exact distances or hydrological connections.

Given the severity of vegetation death and the persistent nature of the soil contamination, this situation may require prompt action to prevent expansion of the affected area or potential impact to neighboring properties.
