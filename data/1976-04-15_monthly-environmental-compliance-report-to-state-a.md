All required sampling and testing protocols have been conducted according to schedule, with results documented herein for departmental review.

## FACILITY OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

### Manufacturing Activities

During March 1976, the John J. Riley Company maintained normal production schedules across all operational divisions. Primary manufacturing activities included leather processing, chemical treatment operations, and finishing processes utilizing various industrial solvents and treatment chemicals. Total production volume for the month reached 847,320 square feet of processed leather goods, representing a 12% increase over February 1976 levels.

Our chemical usage during this reporting period included trichloroethylene (TCE) for degreasing operations, tetrachloroethylene (PCE) for dry cleaning processes, and various chromium-based compounds for tanning operations. All chemical storage and handling procedures followed established protocols, with inventory management conducted according to company safety standards.

### Waste Generation and Disposal

Total waste generation for March 1976 comprised 23,450 gallons of liquid industrial waste and 14,200 pounds of solid waste materials. Liquid waste streams included spent solvents, process wastewater, and cleaning solutions containing various chemical constituents necessary for leather processing operations.

Disposal of liquid industrial waste was conducted through our established ground disposal system, utilizing on-site infiltration areas designed to accommodate process discharge volumes. Solid waste materials were transported to approved disposal facilities by licensed hauling contractors in accordance with state requirements.

## ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING RESULTS
