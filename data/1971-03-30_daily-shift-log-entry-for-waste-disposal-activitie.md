## WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

### Morning Operations (7:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

**Tannery Waste Processing:**
- Processed approximately 2,400 gallons of chrome tanning liquor from Tanks 3 and 5
- Chrome sludge removal from settling ponds - estimated 800 cubic feet
- Disposed of accumulated hair and flesh waste from dehairing operations
- **Disposal Method:** Chrome liquor and sludge transported to rear property lagoon system via truck transport
- **Location:** Disposal area approximately 400 yards northeast of main facility, adjacent to wooded area

**Chemical Waste Handling:**
- Emptied 15 drums of spent tanning chemicals (chromium sulfate solutions)
- Disposed of 8 barrels of acid waste from pickling operations
- **Method:** Drum contents emptied into lagoon system, empty drums stacked for pickup
- **Note:** Some spillage occurred during transfer operations due to corroded drum condition

### Afternoon Operations (12:00 PM - 4:00 PM)

**Equipment Maintenance:**
- Repaired leak in waste transfer pipe leading to lagoon area
- **Issue:** Approximately 50 gallons of chrome solution leaked into soil during repair
- **Action Taken:** Covered affected area with sand and lime treatment
- **Duration of Leak:** Estimated 2 hours before repair completed

**Routine Disposal:**
- Continued chrome sludge removal and transport
- Disposed of accumulated organic waste materials
- **Total Volume Processed:** Approximately 3,200 gallons liquid waste, 1,200 cubic feet solid waste

## EQUIPMENT STATUS

- Waste transfer pump #2 - **OPERATIONAL** (repaired morning leak)
- Truck transport vehicle - **OPERATIONAL**
- Lagoon agitation system - **DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE** (scheduled repair Thursday)
- pH monitoring equipment - **NEEDS CALIBRATION**

## ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATIONS

- **Ground Conditions:** Soil around lagoon area showing increased saturation due to recent rains
- **Runoff:** Noted surface water movement toward eastern property boundary during afternoon rain
- **Odor:** Strong chemical odor present in disposal area, dissipating with wind direction
- **Wildlife:** Observed dead vegetation around lagoon perimeter, consistent with previous weeks

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE NOTES

- **Waste Manifests:** All incoming waste materials logged per company procedure
- **Volume Records:** Daily disposal volumes recorded in master log book
- **Safety Protocol:** All personnel wore required protective equipment during chemical handling
- **Spill Response:** Leak incident documented and immediate containment measures implemented

## ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION

1. **Lagoon Capacity:** Current lagoon system approaching maximum capacity for chrome sludge storage
2. **Equipment Reliability:** Waste transfer system showing signs of accelerated corrosion
3. **Ground Saturation:** Disposal area soil conditions may require improved drainage
4. **Chemical Storage:** Several incoming waste drums showing deterioration and potential leak risk

## RECOMMENDATIONS

- **Immediate:** Schedule lagoon system expansion or alternative disposal arrangements
- **Short-term:** Replace corroded sections of waste transfer piping
- **Long-term:** Consider installation of lined disposal areas to prevent ground saturation

## NEXT SHIFT PRIORITIES

- Continue chrome sludge removal from settling ponds
- Monitor repaired waste transfer system for additional leaks
- Coordinate with maintenance for lagoon agitation system repair
- Process incoming chemical waste shipment scheduled for Thursday morning
