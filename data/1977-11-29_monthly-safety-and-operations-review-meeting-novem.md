### AGENDA ITEMS DISCUSSED

#### 1. SAFETY INCIDENT REVIEW - OCTOBER 1977

Mr. Brennan reported three minor incidents during October operations. Two involved chemical splash exposure requiring eyewash station usage, both resolved without medical attention. One incident involved improper lifting technique resulting in minor back strain for employee Donald McCarthy, who returned to full duty after two days. 

The safety coordinator emphasized the importance of following established protocols for chemical handling, particularly when working with solvents in the degreasing operations. All affected employees have been retrained on proper personal protective equipment usage.

**Action Item:** Brennan to conduct refresher safety training for all chemical handling personnel by December 15, 1977.

#### 2. PRODUCTION OPERATIONS UPDATE

Mr. Mitchell provided production statistics for November. The facility processed 847 tons of materials through the degreasing operations, representing a 12% increase over October figures. The increased production volume necessitated extended operating hours for the trichloroethylene degreasing units, running at capacity six days per week.

Discussion centered on maintaining efficiency while ensuring proper waste handling procedures. Mitchell noted that current disposal methods for spent solvents continue to meet operational requirements, with materials being directed to the designated disposal area on the eastern portion of the property.

The production supervisor recommended evaluating equipment capacity for potential expansion to meet projected 1978 demand increases.

**Action Item:** Mitchell to prepare capacity analysis report for December management review.

#### 3. MAINTENANCE AND EQUIPMENT STATUS

Mr. Carson reported completion of scheduled maintenance on Degreasing Unit #3, including replacement of heating elements and solvent recovery system components. The unit returned to service on November 22nd with improved efficiency ratings.

Routine inspection of storage tanks revealed minor seal deterioration on Tank #7, containing trichloroethylene inventory. Temporary repairs have been implemented, with permanent seal replacement scheduled for December maintenance window.

Carson noted that the facility's waste handling equipment continues to operate within normal parameters. The drum storage area has been reorganized to improve workflow and reduce handling time for spent materials.

**Action Item:** Carson to coordinate Tank #7 seal replacement with production schedule by December 20, 1977.

#### 4. QUALITY CONTROL MATTERS

Ms. O'Brien presented quality metrics showing consistent product standards throughout November operations. Degreasing effectiveness ratings remained above 98% for all processed materials, meeting customer specifications.

Laboratory testing protocols continue to verify solvent purity levels and contamination thresholds. O'Brien emphasized the importance of maintaining consistent testing schedules to ensure product quality and operational efficiency.

Discussion included review of sampling procedures for incoming raw materials and finished products. Current protocols adequately monitor product quality while supporting production schedules.

**Action Item:** O'Brien to update quality control manual with revised testing frequencies by January 1978.

#### 5. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE REVIEW

Mr. Harrison reviewed the facility's environmental compliance status, noting adherence to current Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering requirements. The facility maintains required permits for air emissions and waste handling operations.

Recent correspondence from state environmental officials requested information regarding facility operations and waste disposal practices. Harrison indicated that the company's legal department is preparing appropriate responses to demonstrate compliance with applicable regulations.

The plant manager emphasized the importance of maintaining accurate records of all disposal activities and ensuring proper documentation of waste handling procedures. Current practices include detailed logging of all materials directed to the on-site disposal area.

**Action Item:** Harrison to coordinate with legal department on regulatory correspondence response by December 10, 1977.

#### 6. PERSONNEL MATTERS

Sullivan reported stable staffing levels across all shifts, with no significant personnel changes anticipated through year-end. Recent training programs have improved operational efficiency and safety awareness among chemical handling staff.

The facility continues to recruit qualified personnel for anticipated production increases in 1978. Emphasis remains on hiring individuals with appropriate industrial chemical experience and safety training backgrounds.

Discussion included review of overtime requirements for November operations, which remained within budgeted parameters despite increased production volumes.

**Action Item:** Sullivan to prepare 1978 staffing projections for management review by December 15, 1977.

### DECISIONS MADE

1. **Safety Training Enhancement:** Approved expanded safety training program for all chemical handling personnel, to be implemented before December 15, 1977.

2. **Equipment Maintenance:** Authorized permanent repair of Tank #7 seal system during December maintenance window, with estimated cost of $2,400.

3. **Production Planning:** Approved preliminary evaluation of facility expansion options to meet projected 1978 demand increases.

4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Confirmed commitment to maintaining full compliance with environmental regulations and timely response to regulatory inquiries.
