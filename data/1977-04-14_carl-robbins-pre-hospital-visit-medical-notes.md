## Current Symptoms and Observations

Carl has been experiencing concerning symptoms for the past three weeks that have progressively worsened. As his mother, I am documenting these observations before our appointment with Dr. Henderson at Woburn Medical Associates this afternoon.

### Physical Symptoms:
- **Persistent fatigue**: Carl has been unusually tired, requiring afternoon naps which he hasn't needed since age 4. Yesterday he fell asleep at the kitchen table during lunch.
- **Pale complexion**: His normally healthy color has become noticeably pale, particularly around his lips and under his eyes. Mrs. Kane next door commented on how "washed out" he looked when she saw him playing in the yard.
- **Easy bruising**: I've noticed multiple bruises on his legs and arms that seem disproportionate to normal childhood activities. A small bump on his shin from riding his bicycle has resulted in a large, dark bruise that hasn't faded after ten days.
- **Frequent nosebleeds**: Three episodes in the past week, including one that lasted nearly twenty minutes and required ice and pressure to stop.
- **Loss of appetite**: Carl, who normally eats heartily, has been picking at his food. His weight appears to have dropped noticeably.

### Behavioral Changes:
- **Decreased activity level**: Carl has been less interested in playing outside with his friends. He used to spend hours on his bicycle but now prefers to stay indoors.
- **Irritability**: More frequent crying spells and temper tantrums, which is unusual for his typically even-tempered nature.
- **Sleep disturbances**: Complaining of not feeling rested in the morning despite sleeping his usual 10-11 hours.

## Medical History Context

Carl was a healthy baby, born at Melrose-Wakefield Hospital after a normal pregnancy and delivery. His early childhood was unremarkable medically - routine vaccinations, normal growth and development milestones, and only minor illnesses (chicken pox at age 5, occasional colds).

However, I am increasingly concerned about patterns I'm seeing in our neighborhood. The Zona family lost their youngest, Michael, to leukemia three years ago. The Kane family has been dealing with their son Kevin's illness, and I've heard through church that other families in East Woburn are facing similar struggles with their children's health.

## Environmental Concerns

We have lived at our Pine Street address since Carl was two years old. The house is served by city water from the municipal system. I've noticed that our tap water occasionally has an unusual chemical smell, particularly in the morning, and sometimes appears slightly cloudy. When I've called the water department, they've assured me the water meets all safety standards.

Carl drinks primarily tap water and milk. He plays frequently in the neighborhood, including near the wooded areas behind our street where there are some old industrial buildings. I'm beginning to wonder if there might be some connection between these environmental factors and the health problems I'm observing.

## Family Medical History

There is no family history of blood disorders or cancer on either my side or my husband Robert's side of the family. Both sets of grandparents lived into their seventies and eighties with typical age-related conditions but no major illnesses. Robert's brother served in Korea and remains healthy. My sister in Springfield has three healthy children with no medical concerns.

## Documentation for Medical Appointment

I am preparing this information for Dr. Henderson to ensure I don't forget any details during Carl's examination. The symptoms have developed gradually, but their cumulative effect is alarming. Carl has always been an active, healthy child, and these changes represent a significant departure from his normal state of health.

**Questions for Dr. Henderson:**
1. Could these symptoms indicate a blood disorder?
2. Are there environmental factors in Woburn that could be contributing to children's health problems?
3. What tests should be performed to determine the cause of these symptoms?
4. Should we be concerned about other children in the neighborhood showing similar signs?

## Financial Considerations

Robert's insurance through his job at the shoe factory should cover most medical expenses, but I'm concerned about potential costs if extensive testing or treatment becomes necessary. We have modest savings but would struggle with significant medical bills. I pray that whatever is wrong with Carl can be treated effectively and affordably.

## Immediate Plans

- Medical appointment today at 2:00 PM with Dr. Henderson
- Will request blood work if the doctor recommends it
- Plan to document any additional symptoms or changes
- Will discuss with other parents in the neighborhood about their experiences
