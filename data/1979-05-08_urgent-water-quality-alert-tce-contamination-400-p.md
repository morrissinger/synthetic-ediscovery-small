# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Mayor Thomas C. Higgins  
**FROM:** Robert F. McCarthy, Water Quality Supervisor  
**DATE:** May 8, 1979  
**TIME:** 3:45 PM  
**RE:** **URGENT - Immediate Well G Shutdown Required - TCE Contamination at 400 PPB**

## Critical Water Quality Alert

Mayor Higgins, I am writing to inform you of an extremely serious water quality situation that requires immediate action. Testing conducted on May 7, 1979, at municipal Well G has revealed **trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination at 400 parts per billion**, which is **eight times higher** than the EPA's recommended safe drinking water standard of 50 PPB established under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

This contamination level poses an immediate public health risk to residents served by the East Woburn water distribution system. Well G has been providing approximately 1.2 million gallons per day to households in the Pine Street, Salem Street, and Washington Street neighborhoods since 1964. Based on our distribution maps, this affects approximately 2,800 residents, including 340 households with children under the age of 12.

## Immediate Actions Taken

I have already implemented the following emergency measures as of 2:30 PM today:

- **Well G has been immediately shut down** and removed from the municipal water system
- Emergency notification sent to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (contact: Dr. William Foege, State Health Commissioner)
- Water samples collected and expedited to the state laboratory for confirmatory testing
- Activated backup water supply protocols to maintain service pressure
- Initiated contact with neighboring municipalities regarding emergency water supply agreements

## Required Next Steps

Your immediate authorization is needed for the following actions:

1. **Public Notification**: We must notify affected residents within 24 hours per state regulations. I recommend door-to-door notification teams and emergency notices in the *Woburn Daily Times Chronicle*.

2. **Well H Testing**: Given the proximity of Well H (opened 1966) to Well G, we must conduct immediate testing of Well H for similar contamination. Both wells draw from the same aquifer system in the Aberjona River Valley.

3. **Source Investigation**: The contamination source must be identified immediately. Preliminary assessment suggests potential industrial sources northeast and southwest of the well field, including the W.R. Grace facility at 369 Washington Street and the Riley tannery operation at 228 Salem Street.

4. **Legal Consultation**: Given the severity of this contamination and potential liability issues, I strongly recommend immediate consultation with the city attorney regarding our duty of care obligations to affected residents.

## Health Implications

TCE is a known industrial solvent with serious health implications. At 400 PPB, this concentration exceeds safe drinking water standards by a significant margin. The chemical is associated with liver damage, central nervous system effects, and potential carcinogenic properties. Residents who have consumed this water over the 15-year operational period of Well G may have experienced chronic exposure to this toxic substance.

Dr. Sarah Mitchell at Woburn Hospital has been notified and is prepared to coordinate with state health officials regarding any immediate health screening protocols that may be recommended for affected residents.

## Water Supply Contingency

Our remaining active wells (Wells A, B, C, D, E, and F) can maintain 85% of normal capacity. However, if Well H testing reveals similar contamination, we will face a serious water supply shortage requiring immediate implementation of emergency water distribution protocols and potential activation of our mutual aid agreements with Winchester and Stoneham.

## Regulatory Compliance

This incident triggers multiple reporting requirements:
- EPA notification under SDWA Section 1414 (completed)
- Massachusetts DEP emergency notification (in progress)
- Local board of health notification (scheduled for 5:00 PM today)

Mayor Higgins, this situation demands immediate executive action and full municipal resources. The contamination of our municipal water supply represents a serious breach of our duty to provide safe drinking water to Woburn residents. I am available for immediate consultation and will remain on-site until further notice.
