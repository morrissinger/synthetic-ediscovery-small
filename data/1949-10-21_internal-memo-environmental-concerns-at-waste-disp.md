# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** John J. Riley, Plant Manager  
**FROM:** Robert H. Thompson, Facility Supervisor  
**DATE:** October 21, 1949  
**RE:** Environmental Concerns at Waste Disposal Site - Immediate Attention Required

Mr. Riley,

I am writing to bring to your attention several concerning observations regarding our current waste disposal practices at the tannery facility. During my routine inspection of the disposal area west of the main processing building yesterday morning, I discovered conditions that warrant immediate discussion and potential corrective action.

The chemical waste lagoon established behind the main facility has begun to show signs of seepage beyond the designated containment area. I observed discolored soil extending approximately fifteen feet east of the lagoon's original boundaries, with a distinctive chemical odor present throughout the affected zone. The recent heavy rains appear to have accelerated this condition, and I am concerned about the potential for these materials to reach the Aberjona River, which runs approximately 200 yards to our east. Additionally, I noticed that the groundwater level in the monitoring well we installed last spring has risen considerably, and the water exhibits an unusual greenish tint that was not present during previous inspections.

Our current disposal methods involve the direct application of tanning solutions, degreasers, and leather finishing chemicals to the lagoon system without any form of treatment or neutralization. While this approach has proven cost-effective and aligns with standard industry practices throughout the region, I believe we should consider the long-term implications of these procedures. The volume of waste materials has increased substantially since we expanded operations in 1947, and our current disposal capacity may be insufficient to contain the increased chemical load safely.

I recommend that we schedule a meeting this week to discuss potential modifications to our waste management procedures. Several options merit consideration, including the installation of additional containment barriers around the disposal area, the implementation of chemical neutralization processes prior to disposal, or the exploration of alternative disposal sites that would provide greater distance from local water sources. I understand that any modifications will require capital investment, but I believe that addressing these concerns proactively will serve the long-term interests of the company and demonstrate our commitment to responsible industrial practices.

Please advise when you would be available to discuss this matter in detail. I have prepared a preliminary cost analysis for several potential solutions and would be happy to present these options at your convenience.

Respectfully,

**Robert H. Thompson**
