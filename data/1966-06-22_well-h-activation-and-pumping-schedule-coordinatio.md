# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Water Department Operations Staff  
**FROM:** George P. Hutchins, Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** June 22, 1966  
**RE:** Well H Activation and Pumping Schedule Coordination

Effective Monday, June 26, 1966, we will be bringing Well H online to supplement our current water supply capacity during the summer demand period. This memo outlines the operational procedures and coordination requirements for integrating Well H into our existing distribution system alongside Wells G and the Mishawum wells.

Well H has been completed to a depth of 93 feet and preliminary pump tests indicate a sustainable yield of 400 gallons per minute. The well is located approximately 1,200 feet northeast of Well G in the eastern section of the city, positioned to draw from the same aquifer system that has been successfully supplying water through Well G since 1964. Initial water quality tests conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health show the water meets all current federal and state standards for municipal water supply.

The activation of Well H will allow us to better serve the growing residential areas east of Main Street, particularly during peak summer usage when lawn watering and increased domestic consumption strain our current capacity. The well will be operated in coordination with Well G to maintain consistent pressure throughout the eastern distribution zone. Operations staff should note that both wells will be monitored daily for flow rates, with readings recorded in the standard log books. Any unusual odors, tastes, or visual characteristics in the water should be reported immediately to my office for investigation.

Pump scheduling will follow the established protocol: Well H will operate as a supplemental source during peak demand hours (7:00 AM - 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM) and as needed during periods when the Mishawum wells require maintenance or during drought conditions. All operations staff are reminded of their responsibility to maintain accurate records of pumping schedules, flow rates, and any maintenance activities. These records are essential for ensuring the continued safe operation of our municipal water system and compliance with state health department requirements.

Please ensure all staff are familiar with the location and operation of Well H by the activation date. Any questions regarding these procedures should be directed to my office immediately.
