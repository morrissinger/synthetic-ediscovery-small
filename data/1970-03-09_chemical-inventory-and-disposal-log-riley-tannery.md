## Current Storage and Handling Procedures

### Underground Storage

Building B maintains three underground storage tanks installed in 1965. Tank 1 (500-gallon capacity) currently unused. Tank 2 houses trichloroethylene with concrete access cover and manual pump system. Tank 3 contains perchloroethylene with similar configuration. Regular visual inspection conducted monthly, though no formal leak detection protocols currently implemented.

### Surface Storage

Chemical drums stored in Building B designated area with concrete flooring and drainage to rear facility absorption area. Current inventory includes 12 drums various solvents, 8 drums chromium compounds, and 15 drums miscellaneous process chemicals. Drum storage area equipped with manual handling equipment and basic spill containment consisting of sand and absorbent materials.

### Waste Management Areas

Primary liquid waste disposal utilizes drainage system connecting to excavated absorption areas located approximately 200 feet behind main facility buildings. Absorption areas consist of gravel-lined excavations approximately 8 feet deep, 12 feet wide, and 25 feet long. System designed to allow liquid waste infiltration into underlying soil and groundwater. Secondary disposal area located near eastern property boundary for overflow capacity.

## Process Water Usage and Discharge

**Total Water Consumption:** 45,000 gallons (February 15 - March 9)
**Primary Source:** Municipal water supply via 6-inch main connection
**Secondary Source:** On-site well (occasional use for non-process applications)

**Process Water Discharge Summary:**
- Tanning bath discharge: 15,200 gallons
- Equipment cleaning discharge: 8,900 gallons
- General facility discharge: 12,400 gallons
- Chemical mixing and handling discharge: 3,800 gallons

All process discharge directed through facility drainage system to rear absorption areas as described above. No direct discharge to surface water bodies. Discharge timing typically occurs during regular business hours with peak discharge periods during equipment cleaning cycles.

## Regulatory Compliance Notes

Current disposal practices conform to established company procedures developed in consultation with municipal authorities. No specific state or federal regulations currently mandate alternative disposal methods for tanning industry chemical waste. Municipal authorities have been notified of general waste disposal activities as required for industrial operations.

Recent informal discussion with Woburn Department of Public Works indicated continued acceptance of current disposal practices provided no surface water contamination occurs. No formal permits or monitoring requirements currently applicable to facility operations.

## Operational Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)
1. Continue current inventory management procedures
2. Maintain existing disposal protocols
3. Monitor storage tank levels and condition
4. Ensure adequate absorption area capacity

### Future Considerations (Next 90 Days)
1. Evaluate additional storage capacity for peak production periods
2. Consider expansion of ground absorption areas if disposal volumes increase
3. Review drum storage organization for improved efficiency
4. Assess need for additional solvent inventory based on production forecasts

## Chemical Safety and Handling

Current safety protocols include basic personal protective equipment for chemical handling personnel. Rubber gloves, aprons, and eye protection provided for direct chemical contact activities. Ventilation systems in chemical storage areas operate during business hours. Emergency procedures include sand application for spill containment and immediate supervisor notification for significant incidents.

No reportable incidents occurred during current reporting period. Minor spills addressed through standard cleanup procedures utilizing absorbent materials and disposal via normal waste channels.

## Conclusion

Riley Tannery chemical operations continue at standard production levels with adequate inventory to support current manufacturing requirements. Disposal activities proceed according to established protocols with no operational difficulties encountered. Current storage and handling systems function effectively for present production volumes.

All chemical usage, storage, and disposal activities documented herein represent normal tanning industry practices consistent with current operational standards. Continued monitoring of inventory levels and disposal capacity will ensure uninter
