## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of routine water quality testing conducted on municipal Wells G and H during the third quarter of 1977, in compliance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. Testing was performed on samples collected weekly from both wellheads and the distribution system serving the East Woburn residential area.

Wells G and H continue to operate within acceptable parameters for bacterial contamination and standard chemical indicators. Both wells maintain adequate flow rates to meet current demand from the approximately 3,200 residents served by this portion of the municipal water system.

## WELL OPERATIONAL STATUS

**Well G (Operational since May 1964)**
- Location: East Woburn, adjacent to Aberjona River
- Depth: 180 feet
- Average daily production: 1.2 million gallons
- Pump capacity: 800 gallons per minute
- Service area: Montvale Road, Salem Street, Water Street neighborhoods

**Well H (Operational since March 1966)**
- Location: East Woburn, 300 yards northeast of Well G
- Depth: 165 feet
- Average daily production: 0.8 million gallons
- Pump capacity: 600 gallons per minute
- Service area: Pine Street, Maple Street, Cross Street neighborhoods

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected according to standard protocols established by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Sampling occurred at the wellhead prior to chlorination and at three distribution points within the service area. All samples were transported to the Woburn Municipal Laboratory within four hours of collection and analyzed within 24 hours.

Standard testing parameters included:
- Bacterial contamination (coliform count)
- pH levels
- Turbidity
- Chlorine residual
- Total dissolved solids
- Hardness
- Iron content
- Manganese content

## ANALYTICAL RESULTS

### Bacterial Testing
All samples tested negative for coliform bacteria throughout the testing period. Weekly samples from both wells and distribution points showed zero colony-forming units per 100 milliliters, indicating effective disinfection procedures.

### Chemical Analysis - Well G

| Parameter | Units | Q3 Average | Range | State Standard |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|----------------|
| pH | - | 6.8 | 6.5-7.2 | 6.5-8.5 |
| Turbidity | NTU | 0.8 | 0.3-1.4 | 1.0 |
| Total Dissolved Solids | mg/L | 285 | 260-310 | 500 |
| Hardness (as CaCO3) | mg/L | 145 | 130-165 | - |
| Iron | mg/L | 0.15 | 0.08-0.25 | 0.3 |
| Manganese | mg/L | 0.08 | 0.04-0.12 | 0.05* |
| Chlorine Residual | mg/L | 0.6 | 0.4-0.8 | 0.2 minimum |

*Note: Manganese levels occasionally exceed state recommendations

### Chemical Analysis - Well H

| Parameter | Units | Q3 Average | Range | State Standard |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------|----------------|
| pH | - | 6.9 | 6.6-7.3 | 6.5-8.5 |
| Turbidity | NTU | 0.6 | 0.2-1.1 | 1.0 |
| Total Dissolved Solids | mg/L | 295 | 275-320 | 500 |
| Hardness (as CaCO3) | mg/L | 155 | 140-175 | - |
| Iron | mg/L | 0.18 | 0.10-0.28 | 0.3 |
| Manganese | mg/L | 0.09 | 0.05-0.14 | 0.05* |
| Chlorine Residual | mg/L | 0.7 | 0.5-0.9 | 0.2 minimum |

*Note: Manganese levels occasionally exceed state recommendations

## OPERATIONAL OBSERVATIONS

During the third quarter of 1977, both wells operated with minimal mechanical issues. Well G required routine maintenance on the chlorination system in August, resulting in a temporary increase in chlorine residual levels until proper calibration was restored.

Water production has increased by approximately 15% compared to the same period in 1976, reflecting continued residential growth in the East Woburn service area. Current production capacity remains adequate to meet demand, though peak summer usage approached maximum sustainable output on several occasions in July and August.

The distribution system experienced two minor pressure drops during the quarter, both attributed to increased demand during hot weather periods. No service interruptions occurred, and pressure was restored to normal levels within two hours in each instance.

## TASTE AND ODOR COMPLAINTS

The Water Department received seven complaints regarding taste and odor during the third quarter, a slight increase from the five complaints received during the second quarter of 1977. Complaints were primarily related to chlorine taste and occasional metallic flavors. All complaints were investigated, and chlorine residual levels were adjusted when appropriate.

Two complaints specifically mentioned an unusual chemical taste, reported by residents on Montvale Road and Pine Street. Follow-up testing at these locations showed chlorine residual levels within normal range, and no bacterial contamination was detected. Residents were advised that taste variations can result from seasonal changes in groundwater characteristics.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All testing results demonstrate compliance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards for public water supplies. The minor exceedances of manganese recommendations do not constitute violations of mandatory standards, as manganese limits are advisory rather than enforceable.

Chlorination procedures continue to maintain adequate disinfection as evidenced by consistent negative bacterial test results. The water treatment process effectively removes turbidity and maintains pH within acceptable ranges.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Manganese Monitoring:** Continue monthly monitoring of manganese levels in both wells. Consider installation of manganese removal equipment if levels continue to exceed recommendations consistently.

2. **System Expansion:** Evaluate need for additional storage capacity given increasing demand and peak usage approaching system limits.

3. **Distribution System:** Conduct pressure testing in areas experiencing intermittent low pressure to identify potential infrastructure improvements.

4. **Taste and Odor:** Implement quarterly taste and odor testing protocols to supplement existing chemical analysis and provide early detection of aesthetic water quality issues.

## CERTIFICATION

I hereby certify that the testing procedures and analytical results contained in this report are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge. All testing was conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health protocols and Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.

The water supplied by Wells G and H meets all applicable state and federal standards for public water supply systems as of the date of this report.
