## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Cryovac Division reports another successful year of operations for fiscal year 1970-1971, with continued growth in our packaging film production capabilities and market penetration. Our Woburn, Massachusetts facility has maintained its position as a leading producer of specialized polymer films for industrial and consumer packaging applications, with gross revenues increasing 12% over the previous fiscal year to $47.3 million.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of our operational performance, production metrics, facility improvements, and strategic initiatives undertaken during the reporting period. Key highlights include expansion of our polyethylene film production capacity, implementation of new quality control protocols, and continued optimization of our manufacturing processes to meet growing market demand.

## PRODUCTION OPERATIONS

### Manufacturing Performance

The Woburn facility operated at 94% capacity throughout the fiscal year, representing our highest utilization rate since operations commenced. Our primary production lines maintained consistent output across all major product categories:

- **Polyethylene Films:** 18.7 million pounds produced (15% increase over FY 1969-1970)
- **Specialized Barrier Films:** 3.2 million pounds produced (8% increase)
- **Industrial Packaging Materials:** 12.4 million pounds produced (11% increase)

Production efficiency improvements implemented during the reporting period resulted in reduced material waste and enhanced product quality metrics. Our quality control department reported a 23% reduction in customer complaints related to product defects, reflecting the success of our enhanced testing protocols.

### Facility Operations and Maintenance

Significant capital investments were made in facility infrastructure during fiscal year 1970-1971, totaling $2.8 million in equipment upgrades and building improvements. Major projects included:

**Production Equipment Upgrades:** Installation of three new extrusion lines with enhanced temperature control systems, improving our capacity for specialty film production. These additions required extensive modifications to our utilities infrastructure, including expanded electrical service and enhanced cooling systems.

**Waste Management Systems:** Implementation of improved waste handling procedures for production byproducts and manufacturing residuals. Our facilities management team worked closely with local contractors to ensure proper disposal of all manufacturing waste materials, including solvents used in cleaning operations and chemical residuals from film production processes.

**Building Improvements:** Completion of a 15,000 square foot warehouse expansion to accommodate increased inventory requirements. Additional improvements included updated lighting systems throughout the production floor and enhanced ventilation systems in key manufacturing areas.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

### Revenue and Profitability

Cryovac Division achieved strong financial performance during fiscal year 1970-1971, with total revenues of $47.3 million representing a 12% increase over the previous year. Net operating income reached $8.9 million, yielding an operating margin of 18.8%.

Key financial metrics include:

- **Gross Revenue:** $47,300,000 (12% increase)
- **Operating Expenses:** $38,400,000
- **Net Operating Income:** $8,900,000
- **Capital Expenditures:** $2,800,000
- **Working Capital:** $12,100,000

The division's strong profitability reflects both increased sales volume and improved operational efficiency. Cost control initiatives implemented throughout the year contributed to margin expansion despite rising raw material costs in the polymer industry.

### Market Position and Customer Base

Our customer base expanded by 18% during the reporting period, with particular strength in the food packaging and industrial applications segments. Major customer relationships include contracts with leading food processors, pharmaceutical companies, and industrial manufacturers throughout New England and the Mid-Atlantic regions.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

### Environmental Compliance

The Cryovac Division maintains full compliance with all applicable federal and state environmental regulations governing industrial operations. Our environmental compliance officer works closely with relevant regulatory agencies to ensure adherence to all requirements related to air emissions, waste disposal, and workplace safety standards.

During fiscal year 1970-1971, we completed comprehensive reviews of our waste management procedures and updated our protocols to reflect current best practices in the industry. All manufacturing byproducts and chemical residuals are handled according to established procedures designed to minimize environmental impact while maintaining operational efficiency.

**Waste Stream Management:** Our facility generates various waste streams in the normal course of manufacturing operations, including spent solvents from cleaning operations, polymer waste from production processes, and general industrial waste. All waste materials are properly classified and disposed of through licensed contractors in accordance with applicable regulations.

**Water Usage and Discharge:** The facility maintains appropriate permits for industrial water usage and discharge. Our operations require substantial water resources for cooling systems and cleaning operations, with all discharge water meeting applicable quality standards before release.

### Safety and Compliance Record

The division maintained an excellent safety record during fiscal year 1970-1971, with no significant workplace incidents reported. Our safety committee conducted quarterly reviews of all procedures and implemented enhanced training programs for production personnel.

Regular inspections by state and federal agencies resulted in no citations or compliance issues. Our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of operational safety and environmental responsibility continues to be a cornerstone of our business philosophy.

## STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND FUTURE PLANNING

### Market Expansion

Looking ahead to fiscal year 1971-1972, the Cryovac Division is well-positioned to capitalize on growing demand for specialized packaging films. Market research indicates continued expansion opportunities in food packaging applications, particularly for products requiring extended shelf life and enhanced barrier properties.

We anticipate implementing additional production capacity during the coming fiscal year, with planned investments in new extrusion equipment and expanded warehouse facilities. These investments will support our goal of achieving $55 million in revenues by fiscal year 1972-1973.

### Technology Development

Our research and development efforts continue to focus on innovative film technologies that provide enhanced performance characteristics for our customers. Current development projects include improved barrier films for pharmaceutical applications and specialty films for industrial packaging requirements.

Collaboration with W.R. Grace's central research facilities has yielded promising results in polymer chemistry applications that may lead to new product lines during the next fiscal year.

## OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Supply Chain Management

Rising costs for raw materials, particularly petroleum-based polymers, present ongoing challenges for maintaining profit margins. Our procurement team has implemented strategic sourcing initiatives and established long-term supply agreements with key vendors to mitigate price volatility.

### Regulatory Environment

The evolving regulatory landscape regarding industrial operations and environmental standards requires ongoing attention to compliance procedures. We continue to monitor developments in federal and state regulations and adjust our operational protocols accordingly to ensure full compliance.

### Workforce Development

Attracting and retaining skilled production personnel remains a priority, particularly as we expand our manufacturing capacity. Our human resources team has implemented enhanced training programs and competitive compensation packages to support our workforce development objectives.
