## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report covers property utilization activities for the fifteen-acre Beatrice Foods site in Woburn, Massachusetts for the reporting period of May 1-31, 1974. The facility continues to operate under our standard industrial protocols with consistent production output and minimal operational disruptions. Current tenant operations remain stable with no significant changes to existing lease agreements or site modifications.

## SITE OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

### Primary Facility Usage
The main processing facility maintained full operational capacity throughout May, with production lines running at 87% efficiency. Our primary tenant, Cryovac Inc., continues to utilize Building A for their specialized packaging operations, maintaining their lease agreement terms established in 1969. The tenant has reported no operational concerns and continues to meet all contractual obligations regarding site maintenance and utility usage.

### Secondary Building Utilization
Building B remains partially occupied by John J. Riley Company operations, which have expanded their chemical processing activities to include additional solvent-based cleaning operations. Their monthly rent payment of $2,800 was received on schedule. The company has requested permission to install additional drainage systems to accommodate increased production volumes, which we have approved under standard industrial modification procedures.

### Waste Management Operations
Current waste disposal protocols continue to follow established company guidelines. Industrial byproducts and processing residuals are managed through our contracted disposal services, with regular pickup schedules maintained throughout the month. The designated disposal areas on the eastern portion of the property have been utilized as planned, with no reported capacity issues.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

### Revenue Generation
Total monthly revenue from the Woburn site reached $8,450, representing a 3% increase from April 1974. This includes:
- Primary lease revenue: $4,200
- Secondary building rental: $2,800
- Utility cost recovery: $890
- Miscellaneous fees: $560

### Operational Expenses
Site maintenance costs totaled $2,100 for May, within budgeted parameters. Major expenses included routine facility maintenance ($800), groundskeeping services ($450), and utility infrastructure upkeep ($850). No extraordinary maintenance requirements were identified during the reporting period.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

### Environmental Considerations
The site continues to operate in accordance with applicable Massachusetts industrial regulations. No regulatory inspections occurred during May, and we have received no correspondence from state environmental agencies regarding site operations. Our tenants maintain their own environmental compliance responsibilities under their respective lease agreements.

### Municipal Relations
Relations with Woburn municipal authorities remain positive. Property tax assessments are current, and we have maintained regular communication with the city planning department regarding ongoing industrial operations. No zoning compliance issues have been identified.

## INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS

### Utilities and Services
All utility systems functioned normally throughout May. Water usage remained consistent with previous months at approximately 12,000 gallons daily, primarily supporting tenant operations. Electrical consumption averaged 2,800 kWh weekly, reflecting normal industrial activity levels.

### Site Maintenance
Routine maintenance activities included parking area resurfacing, exterior building maintenance, and groundskeeping services. The perimeter fencing remains in good condition, and security systems continue to operate effectively. No significant infrastructure repairs were required during this reporting period.

## TENANT RELATIONS

### Cryovac Inc. Operations
Our primary tenant continues to demonstrate strong operational performance with no reported issues. Their specialized packaging operations require minimal oversight from our property management team. Monthly safety inspections have revealed no concerns, and their compliance with lease terms remains exemplary.

### John J. Riley Company Activities
The Riley Company has increased their chemical processing activities as anticipated in their lease modification request from March. Their operations include various solvent-based cleaning processes that support local manufacturing industries. The company maintains appropriate insurance coverage and has demonstrated consistent adherence to industrial safety protocols.

## FUTURE PLANNING

### Site Development Opportunities
We continue to evaluate potential expansions of existing operations and additional tenant opportunities. The current utilization rate of 78% suggests capacity for modest growth without requiring significant infrastructure investments. Market conditions in the Woburn industrial corridor remain favorable for continued operations.

### Maintenance Scheduling
Planned maintenance activities for June include routine inspections of all building systems, continued groundskeeping services, and evaluation of tenant-requested facility modifications. No major capital improvements are scheduled for the immediate future.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on current operational performance and market conditions, I recommend maintaining existing operational protocols while exploring opportunities for increased site utilization. The stable tenant relationships and consistent revenue generation support continued investment in this property. Regular monitoring of regulatory requirements should continue to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable industrial standards.

The fifteen-acre Beatrice site continues to represent a valuable component of our regional industrial portfolio, providing steady returns while supporting local manufacturing activities. Current management practices appear adequate for maintaining operational efficiency and tenant satisfaction.
