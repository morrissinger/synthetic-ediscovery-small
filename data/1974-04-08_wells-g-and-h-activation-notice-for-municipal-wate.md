# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Water Department Staff  
**FROM:** Charles F. McKinnon, Director, Department of Public Works  
**DATE:** April 8, 1974  
**RE:** Wells G and H Activation Notice for Municipal Water Supply

## Immediate Activation of Wells G and H

Effective immediately, Wells G and H are to be brought back online to supplement our municipal water supply capacity. Recent demand projections indicate we will require the additional 2.6 million gallons per day capacity these wells provide to meet the growing needs of our expanding residential and commercial districts, particularly in the East Woburn area.

Both wells have been offline for routine maintenance and inspection since February 15, 1974. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health conducted their annual water quality assessment on March 22, 1974, and has cleared both facilities for immediate service resumption. All bacterial testing has returned negative results, and mineral content remains within acceptable parameters for municipal distribution.

## Operational Procedures

Water Department personnel are directed to implement the following activation sequence:

1. **Well G (Wildwood Avenue)** - Activate primary pumping systems at 0800 hours on April 9, 1974. Run initial flush cycle for thirty minutes before connecting to distribution main. Monitor pressure gauges and flow rates during first four hours of operation.

2. **Well H (Maple Street)** - Bring online at 1200 hours on April 9, 1974, following the same flush protocol. Coordinate with Well G operations to ensure balanced pressure throughout the East Woburn distribution network.

3. **Quality Monitoring** - Conduct daily pH and chlorine residual testing at both wellheads for the first week of operation. Weekly bacterial sampling will resume according to state requirements.

The activation of these wells represents a significant enhancement to our water delivery capabilities and will ensure adequate pressure and volume for all municipal customers, including the new residential developments along Montvale Road, Salem Street, and the expanding commercial district near the Aberjona River.

All department personnel should note that Wells G and H will operate on alternating schedules to maximize efficiency and provide redundancy in our system. Any operational concerns or unusual readings should be reported immediately to this office.
