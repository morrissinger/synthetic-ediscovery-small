## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) hereby submits this preliminary contamination assessment report regarding the detection of volatile organic compounds in municipal Wells G and H serving the East Woburn water supply system. Initial testing conducted during May 1979 has revealed the presence of trichloroethylene (TCE) and other industrial solvents at concentrations that warrant immediate regulatory attention and potential federal oversight under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.

This assessment documents preliminary findings that indicate probable groundwater contamination from industrial sources operating within the Aberjona River Valley watershed. The contamination appears to have occurred over an extended period during the operational life of these municipal wells, which have served as supplemental water sources for eastern Woburn neighborhoods since 1964 and 1966 respectively.

## BACKGROUND AND REGULATORY AUTHORITY

### Municipal Water System Description

Wells G and H were installed by the City of Woburn as supplemental sources to augment the primary water supply from Horn Pond and other municipal sources. Well G, located at coordinates approximately 42°30'15"N, 71°09'30"W, commenced operation in 1964 with a design capacity of 400 gallons per minute. Well H, positioned approximately 300 feet northeast of Well G at coordinates 42°30'18"N, 71°09'25"W, began operation in 1966 with a similar design capacity.

Both wells tap the same confined aquifer system within the Aberjona River Valley, drawing from permeable sand and gravel deposits overlain by clay and silt layers of varying thickness. The wells serve residential neighborhoods in eastern Woburn through direct connection to the municipal distribution system, with no intermediate treatment beyond standard chlorination.

### Regulatory Framework

This assessment is conducted pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21, Section 27, and implementing regulations at 310 CMR 22.00 et seq., governing public water supply systems. Federal oversight authority exists under the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq., and National Primary Drinking Water Regulations at 40 CFR Part 141.

The Commonwealth's authority to investigate potential sources of contamination extends to industrial facilities operating under state environmental permits and federal discharge permits issued pursuant to the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.

## CONTAMINATION DETECTION AND ANALYSIS

### Initial Testing Protocol

Routine volatile organic compound testing was initiated on May 15, 1979, following implementation of new analytical protocols recommended by EPA Region I. Water samples were collected from both wellheads using standard EPA sampling procedures and analyzed by the Massachusetts State Laboratory using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques.

### Analytical Results

**Well G Sample Results (May 15, 1979):**
- Trichloroethylene: 267 parts per billion (ppb)
- Tetrachloroethylene: 21 ppb
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 12 ppb
- Total Volatile Organics: 300 ppb

**Well H Sample Results (May 15, 1979):**
- Trichloroethylene: 183 ppb
- Tetrachloroethylene: 8 ppb
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: 6 ppb
- Total Volatile Organics: 197 ppb

**Confirmatory Testing (May 18, 1979):**
Duplicate samples confirmed initial results within analytical precision limits, establishing the presence of industrial solvents at concentrations significantly above background levels typically observed in uncontaminated groundwater systems.

### Public Health Significance

While federal maximum contaminant levels for these compounds have not yet been promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA health advisories suggest that trichloroethylene concentrations above 100 ppb may present potential health risks with long-term exposure. The detected levels in both wells exceed this advisory threshold.

## POTENTIAL SOURCE INVESTIGATION

### Industrial Facility Assessment

Preliminary investigation has identified two major industrial operations within the probable zone of groundwater influence for Wells G and H:

**W.R. Grace Company - Cryovac Division**  
Location: 369 Washington Street, East Woburn  
Operations: Packaging machinery manufacturing, chemical processing  
Permit Status: State Air Quality Permit No. AQ-78-0156, NPDES Permit Pending

The Grace facility, operating since 1953, utilizes trichloroethylene and other chlorinated solvents in manufacturing processes. Site reconnaissance conducted May 17, 1979, observed surface staining and chemical odors consistent with solvent usage. Company representatives acknowledged historical use of trichloroethylene but disputed any improper disposal practices.

**Beatrice Foods Inc. - John J. Riley Tannery**  
Location: 228 Salem Street, East Woburn  
Operations: Leather tanning and processing (ceased operations 1978)  
Permit Status: Former State Water Discharge Permit WD-65-0089 (expired)

The Riley tannery, acquired by Beatrice Foods in 1963, historically used various chemical processing agents including potential organic solvents. The facility ceased active operations in 1978, but site conditions suggest possible historical waste disposal on adjacent undeveloped property owned by Beatrice Foods.

### Hydrogeological Assessment

Preliminary groundwater flow analysis indicates that both identified industrial facilities are positioned upgradient from Wells G and H within the Aberjona River Valley groundwater flow system. Seasonal variations in groundwater flow direction may create complex contaminant migration patterns requiring detailed hydrogeological investigation.

Surface water interaction with the Aberjona River system may provide additional contaminant transport pathways, particularly during high-flow periods when induced infiltration from surface water sources may occur.

## IMMEDIATE REGULATORY ACTIONS

### Well Closure Recommendation

Based on contamination levels detected and potential public health implications, the Department recommends immediate closure of Wells G and H pending comprehensive source investigation and remedial action. Alternative water supply arrangements should be implemented by the City of Woburn to maintain adequate service to affected neighborhoods.

### Source Investigation Requirements

The Department intends to issue formal information requests to W.R. Grace Company and Beatrice Foods Inc. pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E, Section 7, requiring disclosure of:

1. Historical chemical usage and storage practices
2. Waste disposal methods and locations
3. Spill or release incidents
4. Environmental monitoring data
5. Facility engineering drawings and site plans

### Federal Coordination

Given the interstate nature of the potentially responsible parties and the significance of the contamination, the Department requests EPA Region I coordination for:

1. Technical assistance in contaminant source identification
2. Enforcement action consideration under appropriate federal authorities
3. Superfund site evaluation pursuant to CERCLA provisions (when enacted)

## LEGAL IMPLICATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT POTENTIAL

### State Enforcement Authority

The detected contamination may constitute violations of Massachusetts environmental statutes, including:

- Chapter 21E (Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention and Response Act)
- Chapter 21 (Environmental Protection)
- Municipal water supply protection regulations

Potential legal theories supporting enforcement action include negligence in waste disposal practices, creation of public nuisance through groundwater contamination, and unreasonable interference with public water supply rights.

### Federal Enforcement Considerations

Federal enforcement authority may exist under:

- Safe Drinking Water Act violations (pending establishment of maximum contaminant levels)
- Clean Water Act discharge permit violations
- Resource Conservation and Recovery Act provisions (when implemented)

### Civil Liability Exposure

Both W.R. Grace Company and Beatrice Foods Inc. may face significant civil liability for contamination remediation costs, alternative water supply expenses, and potential personal
