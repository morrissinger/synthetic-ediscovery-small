# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Transport Crew  
**FROM:** Frank Morrison, Operations Manager  
**DATE:** April 17, 1972  
**RE:** Waste Disposal Instructions for Tannery Chemical Barrels

This memo provides updated instructions for the disposal of chemical waste barrels from our tannery operations. All transport crew members must follow these procedures effective immediately.

## Barrel Identification and Handling

The chemical barrels requiring disposal are located in the northeast storage area of the facility. These containers hold various tanning solutions including chromium compounds, sulfuric acid solutions, and organic solvents used in our leather processing operations. Barrels are marked with production dates and chemical codes - ensure you can identify the contents before transport. Use standard industrial gloves when handling and avoid prolonged contact with any residue on barrel exteriors.

## Disposal Location and Method

Transport all waste barrels to the designated area behind the facility, approximately 200 yards northeast of the main building near the tree line. This location has been selected for its distance from the main operations and accessibility for our disposal trucks. Barrels should be emptied directly onto the ground in the designated disposal area. After emptying, rinse barrels with water from the facility hose to remove remaining residue - this rinse water can be disposed of in the same area. Empty barrels can then be returned to the main facility for potential reuse or scrap metal sale.

## Schedule and Documentation

Disposal operations should be conducted during regular business hours when possible, typically between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM Monday through Friday. Keep a simple log of disposal dates and approximate number of barrels processed - this information may be useful for our monthly operations reports. No special permits or notifications are required for this disposal method under current regulations.

The efficiency of our waste disposal directly impacts our production costs and facility cleanliness. Your cooperation in following these procedures ensures continued smooth operations at the Riley Company.
