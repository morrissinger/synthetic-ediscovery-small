# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** John J. Riley, Proprietor  
**FROM:** Robert Sullivan, Tannery Manager  
**DATE:** August 23, 1923  
**RE:** Raw Materials Transportation Agreement Summary

---

Mr. Riley,

I am writing to provide you with a summary of the transportation agreements we have secured for the upcoming fall season's raw materials shipments to our Salem Street facility. Following our discussion last week regarding the expansion of our hide processing capacity, I have finalized arrangements with three primary freight carriers to ensure adequate supply chain support for our increased production targets.

**Boston & Maine Railroad Agreement**

I have renewed our annual contract with Boston & Maine Railroad for rail freight service to the East Woburn siding adjacent to our property. The agreement covers transportation of raw cattle hides from stockyards in Boston, Springfield, and Worcester at a rate of $2.40 per ton, representing a modest increase of fifteen cents from last year's rate. The railroad has guaranteed weekly service on Tuesdays and Fridays, with additional runs available during peak production periods in October and November. This arrangement will provide approximately 60% of our raw materials transportation needs and maintains our primary supply line from the major livestock processing centers in Massachusetts.

**Local Cartage Services**

For shorter-haul deliveries from suppliers within a fifty-mile radius, I have contracted with Middlesex County Cartage Company of Cambridge. Their horse-drawn freight wagons will handle shipments of specialty hides, tanning chemicals, and finishing materials from suppliers in Lowell, Lawrence, and the greater Boston area. The rate structure is $0.85 per hundredweight for distances under twenty-five miles, with a surcharge of $0.15 per hundredweight for deliveries requiring overnight travel. This local cartage arrangement provides flexibility for time-sensitive chemical deliveries and specialized hide shipments that require careful handling.

**Chemical Supply Transportation**

Of particular importance to our expanded operations is the transportation agreement for tanning chemicals and solvents. I have arranged with Commonwealth Chemical Transport of Worcester to handle all shipments of chromium compounds, sulfuric acid, and organic solvents required for our chrome tanning processes. Their specialized tank wagons and chemical-rated containers ensure safe transport of these materials to our facility. The cost is $4.20 per ton for liquid chemicals and $3.80 per ton for dry compounds, with delivery guaranteed within forty-eight hours of order placement. Given the hazardous nature of some of these materials, Commonwealth Chemical Transport carries full liability insurance and maintains compliance with state transportation regulations for chemical substances.

These transportation arrangements will support our projected production increase of 25% for the fall season, ensuring adequate raw materials flow to meet the leather orders we have secured from boot manufacturers in Lynn and shoe producers in Haverhill. The total transportation costs represent approximately 8% of our raw materials budget, which remains within acceptable parameters for maintaining competitive pricing on our finished leather goods.

I recommend we proceed with these agreements and request your authorization to execute the formal contracts with all three carriers. Please advise if you require any modifications to these arrangements or if you have questions regarding the terms I have negotiated.

Respectfully submitted,

Robert Sullivan
