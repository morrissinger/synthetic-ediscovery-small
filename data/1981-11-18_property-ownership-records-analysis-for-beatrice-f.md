# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Jan Schlichtmann, Esq.  
**FROM:** Legal Research Team  
**DATE:** November 18, 1981  
**RE:** Property Ownership Records Analysis for Beatrice Foods Dump Site - Chain of Title Investigation

## Executive Summary

This memorandum presents our comprehensive analysis of property ownership records for the industrial site located at 1100 Salem Street, Woburn, Massachusetts, commonly referred to as the "Beatrice Foods Dump Site." Our investigation has revealed a complex chain of title spanning four decades, with multiple corporate entities maintaining operational control over portions of the property where industrial waste disposal activities occurred. The findings detailed herein establish critical foundation elements for potential negligence, duty of care, and nuisance claims against Beatrice Foods Company and related corporate entities.

## Property Description and Location

The subject property consists of approximately 15.2 acres of industrial land situated along the Aberjona River in East Woburn, Massachusetts. The site is bounded by Salem Street to the east, railroad tracks to the south, and undeveloped wetlands to the north and west. Registry of Deeds records indicate the property was originally designated as Lot 47 on the 1923 Woburn Industrial District plat map, with subsequent subdivisions creating the current parcel configuration.

The property's proximity to municipal Wells G and H is of particular significance to our investigation. Well G, located approximately 1,200 feet northeast of the dump site, was installed in 1964. Well H, positioned roughly 1,800 feet to the southeast, became operational in 1966. Hydrogeological studies conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health indicate groundwater flow patterns that would carry contamination from the Beatrice site directly toward these municipal water sources.

## Chain of Title Analysis

### Phase I: Original Industrial Development (1928-1943)

Our examination of Middlesex County Registry of Deeds records reveals that the property was first developed for industrial use in 1928 when Woburn Chemical Works acquired the land from the City of Woburn for $12,500. The deed, recorded in Book 4,127, Page 284, specifically authorized "manufacturing and industrial operations including chemical processing and waste management activities." This early authorization language proves significant for establishing the industrial character of the property and the municipality's awareness of chemical operations.

Woburn Chemical Works operated a solvent recovery facility on the premises from 1928 through 1943, processing industrial solvents including trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and various chlorinated compounds. Company records obtained through our investigation indicate that waste materials from the solvent recovery process were routinely disposed of in unlined lagoons excavated on the western portion of the property. These disposal practices continued throughout Woburn Chemical Works' fifteen-year tenure, establishing the initial contamination source that would affect groundwater quality for decades to come.

### Phase II: Beatrice Foods Acquisition and Operations (1943-1979)

On March 15, 1943, Beatrice Foods Company acquired the property through a warranty deed recorded in Book 4,891, Page 156. The purchase price of $28,000 reflected both the improved industrial infrastructure and Beatrice's intention to establish a significant manufacturing presence in the Woburn market. The deed transfer included all existing structures, equipment, and—critically—all subsurface conditions, including any contamination present at the time of acquisition.

Beatrice Foods operated the facility as a food processing and packaging plant from 1943 through 1967, during which time the company continued using the existing waste disposal lagoons for industrial effluent. Internal Beatrice memoranda obtained through discovery proceedings indicate that company management was aware of chemical residues in the lagoons but elected to continue disposal operations rather than invest in alternative waste management systems. A particularly damaging internal memo dated June 12, 1961, from Plant Manager Robert Hutchinson to Regional Director Thomas Morrison, states: "The old lagoons continue to serve our disposal needs adequately, and the cost of alternative systems would significantly impact our quarterly margins."

In 1967, Beatrice Foods leased a portion of the property to Riley Tannery Corporation while maintaining ownership and operational control of the waste disposal areas. This arrangement, formalized through a ground lease recorded in Book 6,234, Page 78, specifically reserved to Beatrice Foods "all rights and responsibilities regarding existing waste management facilities and subsurface conditions." The lease language demonstrates Beatrice's continued awareness of contamination issues and its assumption of ongoing liability for environmental conditions.

### Phase III: Corporate Restructuring and Disposal (1979-Present)

On September 30, 1979, Beatrice Foods transferred the property to Beatrice Companies, Inc., a newly formed subsidiary, through an internal corporate reorganization. The quitclaim deed, recorded in Book 8,456, Page 291, transferred the property "subject to all existing conditions, encumbrances, and environmental liabilities." This transfer appears designed to insulate the parent corporation from potential environmental liability while maintaining corporate control over the contaminated site.

Our investigation reveals that this corporate restructuring occurred just months before the Massachusetts Department of Public Health began investigating elevated cancer rates in East Woburn. Internal Beatrice correspondence obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests indicates that corporate counsel had advised management of potential environmental liability exposure as early as 1978, suggesting that the 1979 corporate restructuring was undertaken with knowledge of impending regulatory scrutiny.

## Waste Disposal Operations and Environmental Impact

Registry records and aerial photographs document extensive waste disposal activities on the property spanning five decades. The original disposal lagoons, excavated in approximately 1930, were expanded multiple times during Beatrice's ownership. Aerial photographs from 1965 show four distinct lagoon areas covering approximately 2.3 acres of the western portion of the property. These unlined excavations received industrial waste containing trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, benzene, toluene, and other volatile organic compounds.

Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection sampling conducted in 1980 detected trichloroethylene concentrations as high as 15,000 parts per billion in groundwater monitoring wells installed on the Beatrice property. These concentrations exceed federal drinking water standards by a factor of 750, indicating massive contamination of the underlying aquifer. Hydrogeological modeling demonstrates that contaminated groundwater has migrated from the Beatrice site toward municipal Wells G and H, with travel times estimated at 8-12 years depending on seasonal variations in groundwater flow.

## Legal Implications and Liability Analysis

The property ownership records establish several critical elements for potential legal claims against Beatrice Foods and related entities:

**Negligence Claims:** The documented history of waste disposal operations, combined with internal corporate communications acknowledging environmental risks, provides strong evidence of negligent conduct. Beatrice's decision to continue using unlined lagoons despite knowledge of groundwater contamination potential constitutes a clear breach of the reasonable standard of care expected from industrial operators.

**Duty of Care Violations:** As the property owner and operator of waste disposal facilities, Beatrice Foods owed a duty of care to neighboring property owners and municipal water users. The company's failure to implement adequate containment measures or monitor groundwater quality represents a fundamental breach of this duty, particularly given the proximity to municipal water sources.

**Nuisance Claims:** The ongoing contamination of groundwater constitutes a continuing nuisance that substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. The contamination has rendered private wells unusable, diminished property values, and created health risks that persist decades after the initial disposal activities.

## Corporate Successor Liability

The 1979 transfer of the property to Beatrice Companies, Inc. does not shield the parent corporation from environmental liability under Massachusetts law. The corporate restructuring appears to constitute a continuation of the same enterprise under a different corporate form, maintaining the same management, operations, and business relationships. Under the doctrine of successor liability, Beatrice Companies, Inc. assumes responsibility for all environmental liabilities associated with the property, including damages to third parties injured by contamination.

Furthermore, the quitclaim deed's explicit acknowledgment of "existing environmental liabilities" constitutes an admission of corporate awareness regarding contamination issues. This language may be used to establish corporate knowledge and intent in subsequent litigation proceedings.

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

Based on our property records analysis, we recommend pursuing additional discovery in the following areas:

1. **Corporate Records:** Subpoena all internal Beatrice Foods communications regarding environmental conditions at the Woburn facility, with particular focus on the period from 1960-1979.

2. **Insurance Records:** Examine Beatrice's comprehensive general liability policies to determine coverage for environmental claims and identify
