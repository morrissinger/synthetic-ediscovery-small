### DISPOSAL METHOD AND JUSTIFICATION

The waste materials described above require disposal at a secure chemical landfill facility due to their hazardous characteristics and potential environmental impact if improperly managed. The selected disposal facility operates under EPA interim status and maintains appropriate containment systems to prevent groundwater contamination.

**Rationale for Off-Site Disposal:**
1. On-site treatment capabilities are insufficient for the volume and variety of waste generated
2. Secure landfill disposal provides long-term containment of hazardous constituents
3. Transportation to licensed facility ensures compliance with Massachusetts environmental regulations
4. Professional waste management reduces liability exposure for the company

---

### TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING PROCEDURES

All containers have been inspected for structural integrity and proper labeling in accordance with DOT Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR 100-199). Incompatible wastes are segregated to prevent dangerous reactions during transport. The selected transporter maintains appropriate insurance coverage and emergency response capabilities.

**Special Handling Requirements:**
- No smoking or open flames within 50 feet of vehicle
- Driver equipped with emergency response guide and spill cleanup materials
- Route planned to avoid residential areas and sensitive environmental locations
- Scheduled delivery during normal business hours for immediate processing

---

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATEMENT

This manifest is submitted in compliance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21C and associated regulations governing hazardous waste management. The generator certifies that the waste described herein has been properly characterized, packaged, labeled, and marked in accordance with applicable federal and state requirements.

**Generator Certification:** I hereby declare under penalty of law that the contents of this manifest are true, accurate, and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

---

### ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

While this disposal method represents current best practice for hazardous waste management, the generator acknowledges ongoing concerns about long-term environmental protection. The company is evaluating opportunities for waste minimization and alternative treatment technologies to reduce the volume of materials requiring off-site disposal.

**Future Planning:** W.R. Grace is committed to implementing improved waste management practices as new technologies become available and economically feasible. The company will continue to monitor regulatory developments and adjust disposal practices accordingly.
