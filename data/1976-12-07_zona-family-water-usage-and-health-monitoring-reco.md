## Personal Statement

I am maintaining this record because I believe Michael's death and our family's ongoing health problems may be connected to our water supply. The timing of his illness coincided with the strongest chemical tastes and odors we experienced. Multiple families in our immediate neighborhood have experienced similar tragedies.

I have saved all medical bills and records related to Michael's treatment and our family's health issues. Dr. Morrison has suggested we consider having our water tested independently, though the city maintains the supply meets all safety standards.

The loss of Michael has devastated our family emotionally and financially. Pat has taken additional work to pay medical bills, and I have had to reduce my part-time employment to care for the other children's health needs.

I pray that documenting these details may someday help prevent other families from experiencing what we have endured.
