# WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY CAPACITY AND USAGE REPORT
### FEBRUARY 1977

**TO:** Woburn City Council  
**FROM:** Robert P. Magnuson, P.E., Chief Water Engineer  
**DATE:** February 22, 1977  
**RE:** Monthly Water Supply Analysis and Distribution System Performance

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the February 1977 analysis of Woburn's municipal water supply system, including capacity assessments, usage patterns, and operational status of all active wells. Current system capacity meets demand with adequate reserves, though continued monitoring of Wells G and H performance parameters remains necessary due to ongoing operational considerations.

## DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ANALYSIS

### Service Area Coverage

The municipal water system currently serves approximately 32,500 residents across four primary distribution zones:

1. **Central Woburn District**: Served primarily by Wells A and B
   - Population: 14,200
   - Daily Consumption: 1,850,000 gallons
   - Peak Demand: 2,100 GPM

2. **North Woburn District**: Mixed supply from Wells A and B
   - Population: 8,900
   - Daily Consumption: 1,150,000 gallons
   - Peak Demand: 1,300 GPM

3. **West Woburn District**: Primary supply from Well A
   - Population: 5,800
   - Daily Consumption: 750,000 gallons
   - Peak Demand: 850 GPM

4. **East Woburn District**: Primary supply from Wells G and H
   - Population: 3,600
   - Daily Consumption: 465,000 gallons
   - Peak Demand: 520 GPM
   - Service Area: Includes Montvale Road, Pine Street, Salem Street residential areas

### Consumption Patterns

February 1977 consumption data indicates stable usage patterns consistent with seasonal expectations:

- **Total Daily Production**: 4,384,000 gallons
- **Average Per Capita Usage**: 135 gallons/day
- **Peak Hour Demand**: 4,570 GPM (February 18, 1977)
- **Minimum Night Flow**: 1,200 GPM

Industrial users account for approximately 18% of total consumption, with major accounts including:
- W.R. Grace Cryovac facility: 285,000 gallons/day
- Beatrice Foods processing plant: 190,000 gallons/day
- Riley Tannery operations: 145,000 gallons/day
- Various smaller manufacturing: 165,000 gallons/day

## WATER QUALITY MONITORING

### Routine Testing Program

Monthly bacteriological testing of all production wells continues to show compliance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards. Chemical analysis performed quarterly indicates:

**Wells A and B**: All parameters within acceptable ranges
- pH: 6.8-7.2
- Total dissolved solids: 180-210 mg/L
- Iron: <0.1 mg/L
- Manganese: <0.05 mg/L

**Wells G and H**: Parameters generally acceptable with noted observations
- pH: 6.9-7.4
- Total dissolved solids: 220-280 mg/L
- Iron: 0.08-0.15 mg/L
- Manganese: 0.03-0.08 mg/L
- Taste threshold: Occasional reports from East Woburn residents
- Odor threshold: Intermittent detection during high-demand periods

### Consumer Complaints Analysis

February 1977 complaint log indicates:
- Total complaints: 23
- Taste/odor issues: 18 (78% from East Woburn service area)
- Pressure concerns: 3
- Discoloration: 2

Geographic distribution of taste and odor complaints correlates with Wells G and H service territory, particularly:
- Montvale Road area: 8 complaints
- Pine Street residential: 5 complaints
- Salem Street vicinity: 3 complaints
- Olympic Avenue area: 2 complaints

## SYSTEM CAPACITY AND FUTURE PLANNING

### Current Capacity Assessment

Total system capacity of 2,350 GPM provides adequate service with reserve capacity of approximately 15% above peak demand. This margin ensures reliable service during maintenance periods and emergency conditions.

**Capacity Breakdown:**
- Well A: 850 GPM (36% of total)
- Well B: 720 GPM (31% of total)
- Well G: 400 GPM (17% of total)
- Well H: 380 GPM (16% of total)

### Infrastructure Maintenance

Scheduled maintenance for March 1977 includes:
- Well A pump inspection and impeller replacement
- Distribution line pressure testing on Forest Street
- Storage tank cleaning at Mishawum facility
- Routine electrical system inspection at all pump stations

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All production wells maintain compliance with:
- Safe Drinking Water Act provisions
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations
- Local health board requirements

Monthly reporting to state authorities continues as scheduled, with no violations recorded during February 1977 monitoring period.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Continued Monitoring**: Maintain enhanced monitoring of Wells G and H given consumer feedback regarding taste and odor characteristics.

2. **Distribution System Evaluation**: Conduct comprehensive analysis of eastern distribution network to optimize flow patterns and minimize consumer complaints.

3. **Alternative Supply Investigation**: Evaluate feasibility of connecting eastern service area to Wells A and B distribution network to provide operational flexibility.

4. **Consumer Communication**: Develop information program to address resident concerns about water quality while maintaining confidence in system safety.

5. **Equipment Upgrades**: Budget for pump station modernization at Wells G and H to improve operational reliability and efficiency.

## CONCLUSION

Woburn's municipal water system continues to provide adequate supply capacity and maintains regulatory compliance across all operational parameters. While consumer feedback from the eastern service area indicates ongoing taste and odor concerns, water quality testing demonstrates compliance with all applicable health and safety standards. Continued monitoring and system optimization efforts will ensure reliable service delivery to all municipal customers.

The water department remains committed to providing safe, reliable municipal water service while addressing operational challenges through systematic analysis and infrastructure improvements.
