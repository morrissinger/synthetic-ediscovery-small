# Municipal Water Supply Expansion Engineering Assessment

**Prepared for:** Charles W. McKenna, City Engineer  
**Prepared by:** Robert M. Fitzgerald, P.E., Water Systems Engineer  
**Date:** January 20, 1966  
**Project:** Woburn Water System Capacity Analysis and Expansion Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This technical assessment evaluates the current capacity and future requirements of the Woburn municipal water supply system, with particular focus on the operational performance of Well G since its commissioning in 1964 and recommendations for additional water source development to meet projected demand through 1975. Based on current population growth trends and industrial development patterns, the City of Woburn will require additional groundwater extraction capacity of approximately 2.5 million gallons per day by 1970.

## Current System Overview

### Existing Water Sources

The Woburn municipal water system currently operates three primary water sources:

1. **Horn Pond Reservoir** - Primary surface water source, capacity 8.2 MGD
2. **Well F** - Groundwater source, commissioned 1958, capacity 1.8 MGD
3. **Well G** - Groundwater source, commissioned May 1964, capacity 2.1 MGD

### System Performance Data (1964-1965)

**Well G Operational Statistics:**
- Average daily production: 1.85 million gallons
- Peak production capacity: 2.1 million gallons per day
- Static water level: 42 feet below ground surface
- Pumping water level: 58 feet below ground surface
- Well depth: 88 feet
- Casing diameter: 12 inches (steel)
- Pump installation: Vertical turbine, 500 GPM capacity

**Water Quality Parameters (Well G):**
- pH: 6.8-7.2
- Total dissolved solids: 180-220 mg/L
- Hardness: 95-110 mg/L as CaCO₃
- Iron: 0.15-0.25 mg/L
- Chloride: 18-25 mg/L
- Nitrate: 2.1-3.8 mg/L as N

All parameters fall within acceptable ranges established by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health drinking water standards.

## Hydrogeological Assessment

### Aberjona River Watershed Analysis

Well G is positioned within the Aberjona River aquifer system, which represents a significant groundwater resource for the eastern portion of Woburn. The aquifer consists primarily of glacial outwash deposits overlying bedrock at depths ranging from 80 to 120 feet. Hydraulic conductivity measurements indicate excellent water-bearing capacity, with transmissivity values averaging 15,000 gallons per day per foot.

The aquifer recharge area extends northward into the upper Aberjona watershed, encompassing approximately 12 square miles of mixed residential, industrial, and undeveloped land. Natural recharge rates are estimated at 8-12 inches per year, providing sustainable yield potential significantly exceeding current extraction rates.

### Ground Water Flow Patterns

Detailed potentiometric mapping conducted in October 1965 indicates groundwater flow in the Well G vicinity follows a general north-to-south pattern, paralleling the Aberjona River channel. Flow velocities are estimated at 50-80 feet per year based on aquifer characteristics and observed hydraulic gradients.

## Demand Projections and System Requirements

### Population and Demand Analysis

Current service population: 35,200 residents  
Projected 1970 population: 42,500 residents  
Projected 1975 population: 48,000 residents

**Current average daily demand:** 6.8 million gallons per day  
**Peak daily demand:** 9.2 million gallons per day (summer 1965)

**Projected Requirements:**
- 1970: Average 8.5 MGD, Peak 11.5 MGD
- 1975: Average 9.8 MGD, Peak 13.2 MGD

### Industrial Water Demand

Several major industrial facilities within the service area contribute significantly to total system demand:

- **W.R. Grace Company (Cryovac Division):** 180,000 gallons per day
- **Beatrice Foods:** 95,000 gallons per day
- **John J. Riley & Sons (tannery operations):** 220,000 gallons per day
- **Various smaller manufacturing:** 150,000 gallons per day combined

Total current industrial demand represents approximately 9.5% of system capacity, with projected growth of 15-20% by 1970 based on planned facility expansions.

## Recommended System Expansion

### Well H Development

To meet projected demand requirements, I recommend development of an additional groundwater source (designated Well H) in the eastern service area. Preliminary site investigation suggests optimal placement approximately 1,200 feet southeast of Well G, within the same aquifer system.

**Proposed Well H Specifications:**
- Target depth: 95-105 feet
- Anticipated capacity: 2.0-2.5 MGD
- Estimated construction cost: $85,000
- Recommended completion timeline: Fall 1966

### Distribution System Improvements

The eastern distribution network will require reinforcement to accommodate increased flow from the proposed Well H installation. Recommended improvements include:

1. Installation of 1,500 feet of 12-inch main along Salem Street
2. Replacement of existing 6-inch main on Washington Street with 10-inch pipe
3. Addition of pressure-reducing valve station on Montvale Avenue

**Total estimated cost for distribution improvements:** $125,000

## Water Quality Considerations

Regular monitoring of all water sources should continue in accordance with state health department requirements. Well G has consistently produced water meeting all applicable standards since commissioning. The proposed Well H should be equipped with similar monitoring capabilities to ensure continued compliance.

**Recommended monitoring parameters:**
- Monthly bacteriological sampling
- Quarterly chemical analysis including metals, pH, and dissolved solids
- Annual comprehensive analysis including organic compounds

## Environmental and Regulatory Compliance

All proposed developments comply with current Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations for municipal water supply systems. Environmental impact is expected to be minimal given the sustainable yield characteristics of the aquifer system and existing industrial/residential land use patterns in the area.

Required permits and approvals:
- Massachusetts DPH water supply permit
- Woburn Conservation Commission wetlands review
- Local zoning compliance verification

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Total Project Investment:** $210,000
- Well H construction: $85,000
- Distribution improvements: $125,000

**Annual Operating Costs:** $12,000
- Power and maintenance: $8,500
- Water quality monitoring: $3,500

**Benefits:**
- Increased system reliability and redundancy
- Adequate capacity through 1975
- Reduced dependency on surface water sources during drought conditions

## Conclusions and Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required:** Initiate Well H development to ensure adequate capacity for projected 1970 demand levels.

2. **System Reliability:** The addition of Well H will provide essential redundancy and operational flexibility for the eastern service area.

3. **Water Quality:** Continue rigorous monitoring protocols to maintain high water quality standards across all sources.

4. **Future Planning:** Conduct comprehensive system master plan by 1968 to address long-term growth beyond 1975.

5. **Funding:** Recommend municipal bond authorization for $225,000 to cover project costs and contingencies.

The Woburn water supply system has performed reliably since the addition of Well G in 1964. The recommended expansion will ensure continued service reliability while maintaining the high quality standards our residents expect and deserve.
