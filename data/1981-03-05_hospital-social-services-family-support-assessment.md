**RE:** Toomey Family Support Assessment - Patient Patrick Toomey

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the Toomey family's current situation and support needs following the recent deterioration in young Patrick Toomey's condition. Patrick, age 8, has been receiving treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia at Massachusetts General Hospital since his diagnosis in November 1979. The family's circumstances present significant challenges that require immediate intervention and ongoing support services to ensure optimal patient care and family stability.

## Patient Background

Patrick Michael Toomey (DOB: June 12, 1972) was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia at age 7. He is the youngest of three children born to Robert and Mary Toomey of 47 Trinity Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts. The family has been residents of Woburn for twelve years, with both parents employed in the local community - Robert as a machinist at a manufacturing plant in nearby Wilmington, and Mary as a part-time secretary at the Woburn Public Library.

Patrick's siblings include Michael Toomey, age 14, and Susan Toomey, age 11. The family home is a modest two-bedroom ranch house purchased in 1969, with a monthly mortgage payment of $287. The Toomeys have been receiving their municipal water supply from Wells G and H since moving to Trinity Avenue, as confirmed by Woburn Water Department records.

## Current Medical Status and Prognosis

Dr. Margaret Sullivan, Patrick's attending oncologist, reports that the patient's condition has shown minimal response to current treatment protocols. Patrick has completed two rounds of chemotherapy with limited success, and his most recent bone marrow biopsy indicates persistent leukemic cells. The medical team is considering more aggressive treatment options, including experimental protocols that may require extended hospitalization periods of 4-6 weeks.

The family has been informed that Patrick's prognosis remains guarded, with current treatment showing a 30% five-year survival rate. This information has understandably caused significant emotional distress for both parents and siblings.

## Family Assessment and Psychosocial Factors

### Financial Circumstances

The Toomey family's financial situation has become increasingly precarious since Patrick's diagnosis. Robert Toomey's annual salary of $14,200 provides the primary household income, supplemented by Mary's part-time earnings of approximately $3,600 annually. The family's total gross income of $17,800 places them just above the poverty threshold for a family of five.

Medical expenses have created substantial financial strain. Despite having Blue Cross/Blue Shield coverage through Robert's employer, the family faces significant out-of-pocket costs including:

- Prescription medications not fully covered: $85-120 monthly
- Travel expenses for hospital visits: $40-60 monthly 
- Childcare for siblings during hospital stays: $200-300 monthly
- Lost wages due to Mary's reduced work schedule: $150-200 monthly

The family has accumulated approximately $2,400 in medical debt over the past sixteen months, with additional expenses anticipated for upcoming treatments.

### Housing and Living Conditions

The Toomey residence presents several challenges for ongoing patient care. The two-bedroom home requires Patrick to share a room with his brother Michael, creating potential infection control issues given Patrick's compromised immune system. The house lacks air conditioning, which may become problematic during summer months when Patrick's treatment may require isolation from environmental contaminants.

The family's neighborhood has experienced ongoing concerns about water quality, with several residents reporting unusual tastes and odors from their tap water. The Toomeys have begun purchasing bottled water for Patrick's consumption, adding $15-20 to their weekly grocery expenses.

### Family Dynamics and Emotional Support

Mary Toomey has assumed the primary caregiver role, significantly reducing her work hours to accommodate Patrick's medical appointments and hospitalizations. This has created both financial pressure and emotional exhaustion. During interviews, Mrs. Toomey expressed feelings of guilt and helplessness, questioning whether environmental factors in their neighborhood might have contributed to Patrick's illness.

Robert Toomey has maintained his work schedule but shows signs of significant stress and depression. He has become increasingly withdrawn and has declined participation in family counseling sessions offered through the hospital's social services department.

The siblings, Michael and Susan, demonstrate age-appropriate concern for their brother but also exhibit behavioral changes consistent with family crisis. Michael's grades have declined from B's to C's and D's since Patrick's diagnosis, while Susan has developed separation anxiety when away from home.

## Community and Extended Support Systems

The Toomey family has received substantial support from their parish, St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church, including meal preparation, transportation assistance, and emotional support through the church's pastoral care ministry. Several neighborhood families have also provided practical assistance, though this informal support network shows signs of strain as Patrick's illness has extended beyond initial expectations.

The family has limited extended family support, as both sets of grandparents live in other states and have their own health challenges that prevent them from providing significant assistance.

## Recommendations for Intervention

### Immediate Needs (0-30 days)

1. **Financial Assistance:** Initiate application for hospital charity care program to reduce outstanding medical debt. Coordinate with hospital financial counselor to establish payment plan for future expenses.

2. **Transportation Support:** Arrange for hospital transportation vouchers to reduce travel costs for upcoming intensive treatment phase.

3. **Childcare Services:** Connect family with volunteer childcare program through local community organizations to support siblings during Patrick's extended hospitalizations.

### Short-term Goals (1-6 months)

1. **Housing Assessment:** Evaluate potential for temporary housing assistance or home modifications to create appropriate isolation space for Patrick during treatment recovery periods.

2. **Family Counseling:** Implement structured family therapy sessions to address communication patterns, grief processing, and coping strategies for extended illness management.

3. **Educational Support:** Coordinate with Woburn Public Schools to establish home tutoring services for Patrick and additional academic support for siblings.

### Long-term Planning (6+ months)

1. **Disability Benefits:** Assist family in applying for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for Patrick if his condition meets disability criteria.

2. **Vocational Rehabilitation:** Explore job training opportunities for Mary Toomey to increase earning potential while maintaining flexible schedule for caregiving responsibilities.

3. **Legal Consultation:** Given emerging concerns about environmental factors in the family's neighborhood and potential connection to childhood illness patterns, recommend consultation with legal services to understand family's rights and options.

## Resource Coordination

This assessment recommends immediate coordination with the following departments and external agencies:

- Hospital Financial Services for charity care application
- Pediatric Oncology Social Work team for ongoing case management
- Massachusetts Department of Social Services for family support services evaluation
- Woburn Community Action Program for emergency financial assistance
- American Cancer Society for transportation and lodging assistance programs

## Conclusion

The Toomey family faces significant challenges that extend beyond Patrick's medical treatment needs. Their financial stability, housing situation, and family dynamics all require ongoing intervention to ensure optimal outcomes for Patrick's care while maintaining family unity and emotional health. The recommended interventions address both immediate crisis management and long-term stability planning.

This case exemplifies the complex psychosocial factors that impact pediatric cancer treatment outcomes and underscores the critical importance of comprehensive family support services in achieving positive medical and social outcomes.
