# ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEY REPORT
## Beatrice Property Waste Pit Location and Containment Assessment

**Survey Date:** January 15-17, 1977  
**Site Location:** Beatrice Foods Manufacturing Facility, Industrial Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts  
**Surveyor:** Regional Environmental Consulting Associates  
**Report Prepared By:** Dr. Harold Mitchell, P.E., Environmental Engineer  
**Client:** Beatrice Foods Company Management  

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This environmental survey was conducted to assess the current status of waste disposal areas on the Beatrice Foods property and evaluate containment measures for industrial byproducts generated by manufacturing operations. The assessment focused on three primary waste pit locations identified during facility operations between 1962 and 1976, with particular attention to soil conditions, groundwater proximity, and potential migration pathways.

### SITE DESCRIPTION

The Beatrice Foods manufacturing facility encompasses approximately 47 acres of industrial property located in the eastern section of Woburn, Massachusetts. The facility operates continuous food processing operations including meat packing, dairy processing, and associated cleaning activities requiring significant volumes of industrial solvents and cleaning agents. The property is situated on glacial till deposits with underlying bedrock at depths ranging from 15 to 35 feet below surface grade.

Three waste disposal areas have been utilized for industrial byproduct storage:

**Pit Area A:** Located 200 feet northeast of main processing building, dimensions approximately 40 x 60 feet, estimated depth 12-15 feet. Primary contents include spent cleaning solvents, equipment lubricants, and processing waste liquids.

**Pit Area B:** Positioned 150 feet southeast of loading dock facility, dimensions approximately 25 x 45 feet, estimated depth 8-10 feet. Contains primarily solid waste materials including contaminated packaging, filter materials, and maintenance debris.

**Pit Area C:** Located along eastern property boundary, dimensions approximately 30 x 50 feet, estimated depth 10-12 feet. Mixed waste disposal including liquid solvents, cleaning agents, and periodic overflow from processing operations.

### METHODOLOGY

Visual inspection of all waste pit areas was conducted using standard surveying equipment and photographic documentation. Soil sampling was performed at twelve locations across the three pit areas using hand auger techniques to depths of 6 feet below surface grade. Groundwater depth measurements were obtained from existing monitoring wells MW-1, MW-2, and MW-3 installed during 1975 facility expansion.

Weather conditions during survey period: Clear skies, temperature 28-35°F, no precipitation. Ground conditions: Frozen surface layer 4-6 inches, accessible for sampling below frost line.

### OBSERVATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS

#### Pit Area A - Northeast Location
- **Surface Conditions:** Visible liquid pooling in central depression, dark staining extending 15 feet beyond pit boundaries
- **Odor Detection:** Strong chemical odor consistent with chlorinated solvents detected within 50-foot radius
- **Soil Characteristics:** Dark brown to black coloration in upper 3 feet, sticky consistency, visible oil sheening
- **Vegetation Impact:** Complete absence of vegetation within 25-foot radius, stressed vegetation extending to 40-foot radius

#### Pit Area B - Southeast Location  
- **Surface Conditions:** Solid waste materials visible at surface level, minimal liquid accumulation
- **Soil Characteristics:** Moderate discoloration to depth of 4 feet, less pronounced chemical odors
- **Drainage Patterns:** Surface water runoff directed toward eastern property boundary during precipitation events

#### Pit Area C - Eastern Boundary
- **Surface Conditions:** Significant liquid accumulation, overflow evidence during recent thaw period
- **Proximity Concerns:** Located 75 feet from eastern property line, 450 feet from nearest residential property
- **Groundwater Considerations:** Monitoring well MW-3 indicates groundwater at 8 feet below surface, seasonal variation 2-4 feet

### GROUNDWATER MEASUREMENTS

Current groundwater elevations measured January 16, 1977:
- **MW-1 (upgradient):** 12.3 feet below surface
- **MW-2 (mid-facility):** 9.7 feet below surface  
- **MW-3 (downgradient):** 8.1 feet below surface

Groundwater flow direction: Generally east-southeast toward Aberjona River watershed. Estimated flow velocity 2-4 feet per year based on hydraulic gradient calculations.

### FINDINGS

1. **Containment Adequacy:** Current waste pit containment measures are insufficient to prevent subsurface migration of liquid contaminants. No engineered liner systems or leachate collection mechanisms are installed.

2. **Migration Potential:** Soil permeability testing indicates moderate to high infiltration rates in pit areas. Groundwater proximity, particularly at Pit Area C, creates significant potential for contaminant migration.

3. **Surface Impact:** Visible environmental degradation extends beyond immediate pit boundaries, indicating active contaminant release to surrounding soils.

4. **Hydrogeological Concerns:** Groundwater flow patterns direct potential contaminants toward municipal water supply areas located approximately 1,200 feet downgradient from facility operations.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

#### Immediate Actions (Within 30 Days)
1. Install temporary surface covers over all active pit areas to minimize precipitation infiltration
2. Implement weekly monitoring of groundwater levels in existing wells
3. Establish 50-foot buffer zones around pit areas with restricted access

#### Short-Term Improvements (Within 6 Months)  
1. Install additional monitoring wells downgradient from Pit Area C
2. Implement liquid waste volume reduction through process modifications
3. Evaluate alternative waste disposal methods including approved off-site facilities

#### Long-Term Containment (Within 18 Months)
1. Design and install engineered containment systems for continued on-site waste storage
2. Conduct comprehensive soil and groundwater sampling program
3. Develop contingency plans for potential remediation requirements

### REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

Current waste disposal practices may require evaluation under developing federal environmental regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency has indicated increased scrutiny of industrial waste disposal methods, particularly those with potential impacts on municipal water supplies. Proactive containment improvements would demonstrate environmental stewardship and regulatory compliance.

### CERTIFICATION

This environmental survey was conducted in accordance with standard industry practices for waste site assessment. Observations and measurements reflect conditions present during the survey period of January 15-17, 1977. Recommendations are based on visual inspection, limited soil sampling, and groundwater monitoring data available at the time of assessment.
