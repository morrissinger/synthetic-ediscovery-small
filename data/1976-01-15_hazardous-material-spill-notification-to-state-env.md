**Discovery Time:** January 12, 1976, 6:15 AM  
**Notification Delay Reason:** Weekend staffing limitations; incident discovered during Monday morning facility inspection  

## II. SPILL DESCRIPTION

**Nature of Release:** Accidental discharge of chemical solvents from storage area  
**Estimated Volume:** Approximately 150-200 gallons  
**Primary Chemicals Involved:**
- Trichloroethylene (TCE) - estimated 75-100 gallons
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) - estimated 50-75 gallons  
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane - estimated 25 gallons

**Cause of Release:** Preliminary investigation indicates failure of containment system due to corrosion of storage tank bottom plate. Tank manufactured in 1962, last inspected October 1974.

**Location of Release:** Northwest section of facility property, approximately 200 feet from Washington Street property line, adjacent to storm drainage system leading toward Aberjona River watershed.

## III. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Soil Contamination:** Visual inspection reveals chemical staining of soil in approximately 30-foot radius from point of release. Soil samples collected January 13, 1976, for laboratory analysis pending results.

**Surface Water Impact:** No visible impact to surface water bodies observed. Storm drain system inspected - no evidence of chemical entry detected during immediate post-incident inspection.

**Groundwater Concerns:** Release area located approximately 1,200 feet upgradient from municipal water supply wells. Company hydrogeologist consulted; preliminary assessment indicates minimal risk to water supply based on distance and soil composition.

**Air Quality:** No persistent vapor concerns identified. Area ventilated naturally due to outdoor location of spill.

## IV. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACTIONS

**Containment Measures:**
- Contaminated soil excavated to depth of 3 feet
- Approximately 15 cubic yards of affected soil removed
- Plastic sheeting installed to prevent precipitation contact
- Temporary berming constructed around affected area

**Cleanup Activities:**
- Contracted disposal company (Bay State Environmental Services) engaged for soil removal
- Contaminated soil transported to approved disposal facility in Lynn, Massachusetts
- Fresh soil backfill completed January 14, 1976
