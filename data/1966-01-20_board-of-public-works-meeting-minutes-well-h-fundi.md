## AGENDA ITEM 1: APPROVAL OF PREVIOUS MINUTES

Motion made by Member Sullivan to approve the minutes from the January 6, 1966 meeting. Seconded by Vice Chairman Connolly. Motion carried unanimously.

## AGENDA ITEM 2: WELL G OPERATIONAL STATUS REPORT

Superintendent Doherty reported that Well G continues to operate at capacity, providing supplemental water supply to the eastern section of the city. Current daily output averaging 2.8 million gallons per day during peak demand periods. No mechanical issues reported since installation in 1964.

Member O'Brien inquired about water quality testing protocols. Superintendent Doherty confirmed that routine bacteriological testing is conducted monthly in accordance with state regulations, with all tests showing satisfactory results.

## AGENDA ITEM 3: PROPOSED WELL H CONSTRUCTION PROJECT

**Discussion of Site Selection and Feasibility**

Chairman McCarthy introduced the primary agenda item regarding the proposed construction of Well H to further expand municipal water capacity. Superintendent Doherty presented preliminary site survey results for the proposed location approximately 300 yards northeast of Well G, near the Aberjona River.

Superintendent Doherty reported that initial geological surveys indicate favorable conditions for well installation, with the aquifer extending to approximately 90-95 feet depth at the proposed site. The location would provide access to the same water-bearing formation currently supplying Well G, with projected capacity of 3.2 million gallons per day.

Member Sullivan raised questions about the necessity of additional capacity given current demand patterns. Superintendent Doherty responded that population growth projections and industrial development in the eastern section of the city support the need for expanded water infrastructure. Current peak demand periods are straining existing capacity, particularly during summer months.

**Financial Considerations and Funding Sources**

Vice Chairman Connolly presented preliminary cost estimates for the Well H project:

- **Site preparation and access road:** $8,500
- **Well drilling and casing (95-foot depth):** $12,000
- **Pump installation and electrical systems:** $15,500
- **Connection to main distribution system:** $9,200
- **Testing and certification:** $2,800
- **Contingency (10%):** $4,800

**Total Estimated Project Cost:** $52,800

Discussion ensued regarding funding mechanisms. Chairman McCarthy noted that the City Council has indicated willingness to consider a special appropriation for water infrastructure improvements, given the critical nature of water supply expansion.

Member O'Brien suggested exploring state funding opportunities through the Massachusetts Department of Public Health water supply improvement program. Superintendent Doherty agreed to investigate available grants and low-interest loan programs.

**Timeline and Implementation**

Superintendent Doherty proposed the following project timeline:

- **February 1966:** Finalize site surveys and obtain necessary permits
- **March 1966:** Submit funding request to City Council
- **April-May 1966:** Contractor selection and contract negotiation
- **June-August 1966:** Construction and installation
- **September 1966:** Testing and system integration
- **October 1966:** Begin operations

Member Sullivan expressed concern about potential disruption to existing service during connection to the main distribution system. Superintendent Doherty assured the board that connections would be scheduled during low-demand periods to minimize service interruptions.

## AGENDA ITEM 4: ENVIRONMENTAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

**State Regulatory Requirements**

Superintendent Doherty reviewed state requirements for new water supply installations, including mandatory water quality testing, bacteriological analysis, and compliance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations. All testing protocols will be implemented prior to bringing Well H online.

Chairman McCarthy emphasized the importance of maintaining the highest water quality standards to protect public health and meet regulatory obligations.

**Impact on Existing Infrastructure**

Discussion of integration with existing water distribution network. Superintendent Doherty confirmed that current main line capacity is adequate to handle additional volume from Well H without requiring major distribution system upgrades.

Member O'Brien inquired about long-term maintenance requirements and operational costs. Superintendent Doherty estimated annual operational costs of approximately $3,200, including electrical, maintenance, and testing expenses.

## AGENDA ITEM 5: PUBLIC COMMUNICATION STRATEGY

**Community Notification**

Chairman McCarthy stressed the importance of keeping residents informed about water system improvements. Board agreed to issue public notice in the Woburn Daily Times regarding the proposed Well H project and its benefits to the community.

Vice Chairman Connolly suggested scheduling a public hearing if requested by residents, though none is required by regulation for this type of infrastructure project.

## AGENDA ITEM 6: NEXT STEPS AND ACTION ITEMS

**Immediate Actions Required:**

1. **Superintendent Doherty:** Complete final site surveys and submit permit applications to state agencies (Due: February 15, 1966)

2. **Chairman McCarthy:** Present funding proposal to City Council Finance Committee (Due: February 28, 1966)

3. **Member O'Brien:** Research state funding opportunities and grant programs (Due: February 20, 1966)

## AGENDA ITEM 7: OTHER BUSINESS

Member Sullivan reported resident complaints about water pressure fluctuations in the Pine Street area during peak usage periods. Superintendent Doherty will investigate and report back at the next meeting.

Vice Chairman Connolly raised concerns about winter maintenance of existing well facilities. Superintendent Doherty confirmed that all winterization procedures have been completed and equipment is operating normally despite recent cold snap.
