Dear Sir or Madam:

The City of Woburn Environmental Department is conducting a comprehensive review of industrial chemical usage and waste disposal practices within our municipal boundaries, with particular attention to facilities located in proximity to our public water supply sources. This inquiry is prompted by recent developments regarding the quality of our municipal water supply and our obligation to protect the health and welfare of Woburn residents.

As you are aware, the City of Woburn operates municipal Wells G and H in East Woburn, which have served as supplemental water sources for our community since the mid-1960s. These wells draw from an aquifer system that provides domestic water to numerous families in eastern Woburn neighborhoods. Recent testing protocols have raised questions about potential contamination sources that may affect the integrity of our water supply system. Given your facility's location within the Aberjona River Valley and its proximity to our municipal wells, we are requesting your cooperation in providing detailed information about your operations.

Specifically, we require documentation regarding the types and quantities of chemical substances used at your Washington Street facility, including but not limited to industrial solvents, cleaning agents, and any volatile organic compounds utilized in your manufacturing processes. We understand that your facility manufactures packaging machinery and related equipment, which may involve the use of trichloroethylene and similar industrial solvents. Please provide a comprehensive inventory of all chemicals currently stored on your premises, as well as historical records of chemical usage dating back to 1964 when your operations commenced at this location.

Additionally, we request detailed information about your waste disposal practices, including methods of disposal for liquid wastes, solid chemical wastes, and any contaminated materials generated during your manufacturing processes. Please include documentation of all waste disposal contractors utilized by your facility, disposal site locations, and any permits or authorizations obtained for waste disposal activities. We are particularly interested in understanding how chemical wastes have been managed on your property and whether any disposal activities have occurred on-site.

The City of Woburn takes its responsibility for public health protection seriously, and we trust that W.R. Grace Company shares this commitment to environmental stewardship. Your prompt and comprehensive response to this inquiry will assist us in our ongoing assessment of potential environmental impacts within our community. We request that you provide the requested documentation within thirty (30) days of receipt of this letter.

Should you have any questions regarding this request or wish to discuss these matters further, please contact our office at your earliest convenience. We appreciate your anticipated cooperation in this important matter affecting the welfare of our residents.

Sincerely,

**Robert J. Mulligan**  
Director, Environmental Department  
City of Woburn
