# TRICHLOROETHYLENE AND INDUSTRIAL SOLVENTS STOCK ASSESSMENT
## December 1968

**W.R. Grace Company - Woburn Facility**  
**68 Water Street, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801**

**Report No.:** WG-INV-1268-004  
**Date:** December 18, 1968  
**Time:** 09:15 EST  
**Prepared by:** Chemical Supply Coordinator  
**Distribution:** Grace Plant Chemist, Production Manager, Facility Supervisor

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This monthly inventory assessment documents current stock levels of trichloroethylene (TCE) and related industrial solvents at the Woburn manufacturing facility as of December 15, 1968. Current TCE inventory stands at **47,200 gallons** across multiple storage configurations, representing a 15% increase from November levels due to expanded degreasing operations in Building C. Consumption rates have accelerated significantly with the implementation of new vapor degreasing equipment installed in October 1968.

This report identifies critical storage capacity limitations and recommends immediate expansion of containment facilities to accommodate projected Q1 1969 production schedules. Current disposal protocols for spent solvents and contaminated materials require review to ensure operational efficiency and regulatory compliance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines.

## INVENTORY BREAKDOWN BY CHEMICAL TYPE

### Primary Solvents

**Trichloroethylene (TCE) - Technical Grade**
- Storage Tank A-1 (15,000 gallon capacity): 12,800 gallons
- Storage Tank A-2 (15,000 gallon capacity): 14,600 gallons  
- Storage Tank B-1 (20,000 gallon capacity): 19,800 gallons
- **Total TCE Stock: 47,200 gallons**

**Tetrachloroethylene (PCE)**
- Storage Tank C-1 (8,000 gallon capacity): 6,400 gallons
- Drum storage (55-gallon containers): 880 gallons (16 drums)
- **Total PCE Stock: 7,280 gallons**

**1,1,1-Trichloroethane**
- Storage Tank D-1 (5,000 gallon capacity): 3,200 gallons
- Drum storage: 440 gallons (8 drums)
- **Total TCA Stock: 3,640 gallons**

### Secondary Solvents and Cleaning Agents

**Methylene Chloride**
- Drum storage: 1,100 gallons (20 drums)

**Freon-113 (1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane)**
- Specialized storage: 320 gallons (6 containers)

**Acetone (Technical Grade)**
- Drum storage: 660 gallons (12 drums)

## CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS

### Monthly Usage Patterns (December 1968)

**Trichloroethylene Consumption:**
- Vapor degreasing operations: 8,400 gallons
- Parts cleaning and maintenance: 2,100 gallons
- Cryovac division operations: 3,800 gallons
- **Total December TCE Usage: 14,300 gallons**

This represents a 22% increase over November consumption (11,700 gallons), primarily attributed to expanded production schedules and the full operational deployment of the new vapor degreasing system in Building C. The increased consumption rate indicates we are approaching maximum sustainable usage levels given current storage capacity.

**Disposal and Waste Generation:**
- Spent TCE requiring disposal: 4,200 gallons
- Contaminated sludge (estimated TCE content): 800 gallons equivalent
- Cleaning rags and absorbent materials: 12 cubic yards

---

## STORAGE FACILITY STATUS

### Primary Storage Infrastructure

**Tank Farm Area (Northeast Section)**
- All primary storage tanks operational with no reported leaks
- Tank A-1 requires scheduled maintenance in January 1969
- Secondary containment systems functioning within specifications
- Vapor recovery systems operating at 85% efficiency

**Drum Storage Areas**
- Building D storage area: 67% capacity utilization
- Outdoor storage pad: 45% capacity utilization
- All drum storage areas equipped with spill containment

### Storage Capacity Limitations

Current storage capacity is approaching critical thresholds. With projected Q1 1969 production increases of 25-30%, existing storage infrastructure will be insufficient to maintain adequate safety margins. Tank A-2 has exhibited minor seal deterioration requiring monitoring and potential replacement of gasket systems.

## OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES AND HANDLING

### Current Disposal Methods

**Spent Solvent Disposal:**
- Primary method: Off-site disposal through certified contractor (Norwood Chemical Disposal, Inc.)
- Secondary method: On-site treatment in Building E settling tanks
- Emergency disposal: Authorized discharge to municipal drain system (permit WB-1967-15)

**Contaminated Materials:**
- Solid waste disposal through standard municipal collection
- Liquid waste processing through on-site separation systems
- Vapor emissions managed through stack discharge systems

### Safety and Monitoring Protocols

**Personnel Exposure Monitoring:**
- Monthly air sampling in all solvent handling areas
- Personal protective equipment compliance at 92%
- Ventilation systems maintained per manufacturer specifications

**Environmental Monitoring:**
- Quarterly groundwater sampling at three monitoring points
- Monthly soil sampling around storage tank areas
- Stack emission monitoring per state requirements

---

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

### Current Permits and Authorizations

- Massachusetts Air Pollution Control Permit: AP-67-0234 (expires June 1969)
- Hazardous Materials Storage Permit: HMS-1966-78 (current)
- Municipal Discharge Permit: WB-1967-15 (renewable annually)

### Compliance Observations

All current operations maintain compliance with existing Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations regarding industrial solvent storage and handling. Recent correspondence from state environmental officials indicates potential revisions to discharge permit requirements in 1969, which may necessitate modifications to current disposal procedures.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required (30 days)

1. **Expand Storage Capacity:** Install additional 15,000-gallon storage tank to accommodate projected 1969 production increases
2. **Maintenance Schedule:** Complete scheduled maintenance on Tank A-1 and replace deteriorating seals on Tank A-2
3. **Disposal Protocol Review:** Evaluate current disposal methods for cost-effectiveness and regulatory compliance

### Medium-Term Improvements (90 days)

1. **Vapor Recovery Enhancement:** Upgrade vapor recovery systems to achieve 95% efficiency target
2. **Secondary Containment:** Install additional containment systems around drum storage areas
3. **Monitoring Equipment:** Install continuous monitoring systems for early leak detection

### Long-Term Strategic Planning (12 months)

1. **Facility Expansion:** Develop comprehensive plan for expanded solvent storage and handling capabilities
2. **Technology Upgrade:** Evaluate closed-loop solvent recovery systems to reduce disposal requirements
3. **Regulatory Preparation:** Prepare for anticipated changes in state and federal environmental regulations

---

## COST ANALYSIS

### Current Monthly Operating Costs

- Solvent procurement: $18,400
- Disposal services: $3,200  
- Storage and handling: $1,800
- Regulatory compliance: $600
- **Total Monthly Cost: $24,000**

### Projected Cost Impacts

Recommended improvements will require capital investment of approximately $45,000 over the next 12 months, with anticipated operational savings of $2,400 monthly through improved efficiency and reduced disposal costs.
