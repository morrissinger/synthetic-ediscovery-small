# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Mr. John J. Riley, Proprietor  
**FROM:** Thomas McKenna, Operations Supervisor  
**DATE:** September 4, 1912  
**RE:** Tannery Capacity Expansion Recommendations and Cost Analysis

## Executive Summary

Following your directive to assess our current production capabilities and evaluate expansion opportunities, I have completed a comprehensive review of our Salem Street facility operations. Our tannery has demonstrated consistent growth over the past three years, with hide processing increasing from 2,400 units monthly in 1910 to our current capacity of 3,800 units. Based on current market demand and available contracts, I recommend proceeding with the proposed expansion that would increase our monthly processing capacity to 6,000 hides by spring 1913.

## Current Operations Assessment

Our present facility utilizes the full capacity of our existing lime vats and chrome tanning baths. The four primary processing bays are operating at maximum efficiency, with workers maintaining two full shifts daily except Sundays. The proximity to the Aberjona River continues to provide adequate water supply for our soaking and washing operations, though increased volume will require additional intake infrastructure. Our current chemical storage area houses sufficient quantities of lime, chromium sulfate, and various oils, though expansion will necessitate enlarging these storage facilities to accommodate increased chemical requirements.

The railroad siding arrangement has proven satisfactory for receiving raw hides and shipping finished leather goods. However, expanded operations will require negotiating additional freight car scheduling with the Boston & Maine Railroad to handle the increased volume of incoming materials and outgoing products.

## Proposed Expansion Plan

The recommended expansion involves constructing an additional processing building measuring 80 feet by 120 feet on the southwestern portion of our property. This structure would house six new tanning vats, expanded drying facilities, and additional finishing equipment. The construction would position the new building between our current operations and the railroad tracks, maximizing efficient material flow while utilizing available land.

Chemical storage expansion requires construction of a separate facility measuring 40 feet by 60 feet, positioned west of the main buildings for convenient railroad access. This storage building would accommodate the increased volumes of lime, chromium compounds, acids, and finishing chemicals necessary for expanded production. The design includes proper drainage systems to direct any spillage toward the existing drainage channels that flow toward the Aberjona River, consistent with standard industrial practices.

## Cost Analysis

**Construction Costs:**
- Main processing building: $8,400
- Chemical storage facility: $2,800  
- Equipment and machinery: $12,600
- Additional vats and processing equipment: $6,200
- Infrastructure improvements (water lines, drainage): $3,400
- **Total Construction Investment: $33,400**

**Operational Cost Increases:**
- Additional workforce (12 new positions): $3,600 annually
- Increased chemical purchases: $7,200 annually  
- Additional fuel and utilities: $1,800 annually
- Railroad freight increases: $2,400 annually
- **Total Annual Operating Increase: $15,000**

## Revenue Projections

Current contracts with Boston leather goods manufacturers indicate sustained demand for our expanded capacity. The Middlesex Shoe Company has committed to purchasing 1,800 additional finished hides monthly beginning January 1913, representing $2,160 in additional monthly revenue. Similar commitments from Salem Boot Works and Worcester Leather Goods Company would generate combined additional monthly revenue of $1,940.

Conservative projections indicate the expansion would generate $49,200 in additional annual revenue by full operational capacity in mid-1913, providing a favorable return on the $33,400 capital investment within eighteen months.

## Recommendations

I strongly recommend proceeding with this expansion plan immediately to capture available market opportunities. The construction timeline requires beginning foundation work before October weather conditions deteriorate. Chemical storage facility completion should precede the main building to ensure adequate supply management during construction.

The expanded operations will require establishing additional drainage systems to handle increased wastewater from hide processing and chemical cleaning operations. These drainage improvements should direct effluent toward existing channels flowing to the Aberjona River, following established industrial practices for waste management.

I request authorization to begin securing construction permits from Woburn municipal authorities and initiating contractor negotiations. The favorable market conditions and available financing make this expansion both prudent and profitable for our continued growth in the Massachusetts leather industry.
