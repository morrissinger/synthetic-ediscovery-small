## DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM NOTES

The 18 Floyd Street connection is supplied through the East Woburn distribution network, which receives water from the municipal well system including Wells G and H when operational. The East Woburn area, bounded by Main Street (Route 38) to the west, the city limits to the east and north, and Montvale Avenue to the south, is served by a grid of 6-inch and 8-inch cast iron mains installed between 1958 and 1968.

Water pressure in this zone typically ranges from 35-50 PSI during normal operations. During periods of high demand or when Wells G and H are offline for maintenance, pressure may decrease to 25-30 PSI but remains adequate for residential service.
