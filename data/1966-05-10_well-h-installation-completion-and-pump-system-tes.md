## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Municipal Contractors Inc. has successfully completed the installation of Well H for the City of Woburn municipal water supply system. This report documents the completion of drilling operations, well construction, pump installation, and comprehensive testing of the new water supply facility. Well H has been drilled to a depth of 102 feet and equipped with a submersible pump system capable of delivering 800 gallons per minute to the municipal distribution network.

All construction activities have been completed in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations and City of Woburn specifications. Initial water quality testing indicates the well produces water meeting all applicable standards for municipal consumption. The facility is ready for integration into the existing water supply system serving East Woburn residents.

## PROJECT BACKGROUND

The installation of Well H represents the second major expansion of Woburn's municipal water supply capacity in the eastern section of the city, following the successful operation of Well G since 1964. Located approximately 1,200 feet northeast of existing Well G, the new facility taps the same productive aquifer system underlying the Aberjona River watershed. The project was authorized by the Woburn Board of Selectmen on December 14, 1965, to address growing water demand in the eastern residential areas of the city.

Site selection was based on hydrogeological surveys conducted by Whitman & Howard Engineering in 1965, which identified the location as optimal for groundwater extraction within the established wellhead protection area. The selected site provides adequate separation from existing wells while maintaining access to the most productive portions of the underlying aquifer.

## DRILLING AND CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS

### Well Construction Details

**Total Depth:** 102 feet below ground surface  
**Casing Diameter:** 12 inches (0-85 feet), 8 inches (85-102 feet)  
**Screen Interval:** 85-100 feet below ground surface  
**Screen Type:** Johnson well screen, stainless steel, 0.020-inch slot  
**Gravel Pack:** Pea gravel, 10-20 mesh, installed from 80-102 feet  
**Annular Seal:** Bentonite clay seal from surface to 75 feet  
**Surface Completion:** Concrete pad, 10 feet x 10 feet x 8 inches thick

### Geological Log Summary

- **0-15 feet:** Fill material and topsoil
- **15-35 feet:** Brown silty clay with organic matter
- **35-55 feet:** Gray clay with sand lenses
- **55-75 feet:** Fine to medium sand with clay layers
- **75-95 feet:** Coarse sand and gravel (primary aquifer)
- **95-102 feet:** Medium sand with gravel

The aquifer materials encountered are consistent with regional geology and similar to conditions found during Well G construction. The primary water-bearing zone consists of well-sorted sand and gravel deposits typical of glacial outwash materials in the Aberjona River valley.

## PUMP INSTALLATION AND EQUIPMENT

### Pump System Specifications

**Pump Type:** Submersible turbine pump  
**Manufacturer:** Goulds Pumps Inc., Model 10HS05  
**Rated Capacity:** 800 gallons per minute at 180 feet total dynamic head  
**Motor:** 25 horsepower, 460 volt, 3-phase  
**Pump Setting:** 95 feet below ground surface  
**Discharge Pipe:** 8-inch steel, cement-lined  
**Control Panel:** NEMA 4 enclosure with automatic controls

The pump installation includes a pitless adapter connection to allow for easy maintenance access while maintaining sanitary conditions. All electrical connections have been completed by licensed electricians in accordance with National Electrical Code requirements.

## PERFORMANCE TESTING RESULTS

### Pump Performance Test

A comprehensive 72-hour pump performance test was conducted from May 6-9, 1966, to evaluate well capacity and pump efficiency. Testing was performed under continuous pumping conditions with regular monitoring of water levels, flow rates, and electrical parameters.

**Test Results:**
- **Maximum Sustained Flow:** 825 gallons per minute
- **Drawdown at 800 gpm:** 42 feet
- **Static Water Level:** 28 feet below ground surface
- **Pumping Water Level (800 gpm):** 70 feet below ground surface
- **Specific Capacity:** 19.0 gallons per minute per foot of drawdown

The well demonstrates excellent hydraulic performance with specific capacity values exceeding design specifications. Recovery testing following pump shutdown indicated complete water level recovery within 4 hours, suggesting good aquifer connectivity and sustainable yield capacity.

### Water Quality Analysis

Initial water quality samples were collected during the performance test and submitted to Commonwealth Laboratories for analysis. Results indicate compliance with all Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards for municipal water supplies.

**Key Water Quality Parameters:**
- **pH:** 6.8
- **Total Dissolved Solids:** 245 mg/L
- **Hardness (as CaCO3):** 180 mg/L
- **Iron:** 0.15 mg/L
- **Manganese:** 0.08 mg/L
- **Chloride:** 28 mg/L
- **Nitrate:** 2.1 mg/L
- **Coliform Bacteria:** Absent

Water quality is consistent with other wells in the municipal system and requires no treatment prior to distribution. The slightly acidic pH is typical of groundwater in the region and falls within acceptable ranges for municipal supply.

## SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND CONTROLS

Well H has been connected to the existing municipal water distribution system through 12-inch ductile iron transmission main extending 800 feet to the connection point on Pleasant Street. The installation includes:

- **Flow Meter:** 8-inch turbine meter with totalizing register
- **Pressure Monitoring:** Continuous pressure recording at wellhead
- **Chlorination System:** Automatic chlorine injection for disinfection
- **Remote Controls:** Telephone line connection to central control station
- **Emergency Shutdown:** Manual and automatic shutdown capabilities

The control system allows for remote operation from the main pumping station on Montvale Avenue, enabling coordinated operation with existing Wells A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Automatic controls will activate Well H when system pressure drops below 45 psi or when storage tank levels reach predetermined low points.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All construction activities have been completed in compliance with applicable regulations:

- **Massachusetts Department of Public Health:** Well construction permit WOB-66-12 approved March 15, 1966
- **Woburn Board of Health:** Local permit issued January 20, 1966
- **Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality:** Groundwater withdrawal registration filed
- **National Sanitation Foundation:** Equipment certifications verified

Required documentation has been submitted to all regulatory agencies, and final approvals are pending receipt of this completion report.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on construction and testing results, Municipal Contractors Inc. recommends the following:

1. **Immediate Integration:** Well H is ready for immediate integration into the municipal water supply system and can begin serving East Woburn residents.

2. **Operational Parameters:** Initial operation should target 600-700 gallons per minute to ensure optimal pump efficiency and minimize wear.

3. **Monitoring Program:** Implement monthly water level monitoring and quarterly water quality testing to track long-term performance.

4. **Maintenance Schedule:** Establish annual pump inspection and cleaning schedule to maintain peak performance.

5. **Aquifer Protection:** Continue monitoring of land use activities in the wellhead protection area to prevent contamination.

## CONCLUSION

The installation of Well H represents a significant enhancement to Woburn's municipal water supply infrastructure. The facility meets all design specifications and regulatory requirements, providing reliable water supply capacity for continued community growth. The well's location and construction ensure long-term sustainability while maintaining water quality standards expected by municipal customers.
