# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** All Floor Workers - Production Department  
**FROM:** Frank Sullivan, Plant Supervisor  
**DATE:** March 9, 1970  
**RE:** Chemical Residue Disposal Instructions - Riverside Property

This memo provides updated instructions for the disposal of chemical residues and cleaning solvents from our production operations. All floor workers must follow these procedures effective immediately to maintain efficient plant operations and comply with company disposal protocols.

**Disposal Area Location:** The designated disposal area is located on the riverside section of our property, approximately 200 yards southeast of the main production building. This area has been selected for its convenient access and natural drainage characteristics that will facilitate the breakdown of chemical materials. Workers should use the service road that runs along the eastern fence line to transport materials to this location.

**Approved Materials for Disposal:** The following materials may be disposed of in the riverside area: trichloroethylene (TCE) cleaning solutions used in degreasing operations, perchloroethylene (PCE) solvents from parts cleaning, methylene chloride from paint stripping operations, and associated rinse waters from production cleaning cycles. Empty solvent drums and containers should also be taken to this area after being thoroughly drained. Any residual liquids in containers should be poured directly onto the ground in the designated zone to ensure complete disposal.

**Disposal Procedures:** When transporting chemical materials to the disposal site, use the wheeled carts provided and ensure loads are balanced to prevent spillage during transport. Upon arrival at the riverside disposal area, pour liquid wastes directly onto the ground in a dispersed pattern to promote natural absorption and breakdown. The soil composition in this area has proven effective for processing these materials. Solid waste materials such as contaminated rags, filters, and empty containers should be placed in the designated pit area and covered with soil as needed. During periods of heavy rainfall, disposal operations may continue as normal since the increased water flow will assist in the natural processing of materials.

**Safety and Efficiency Notes:** These disposal procedures have been developed to maintain the smooth operation of our production schedules while managing waste materials in the most practical manner available. Workers should wear standard work gloves when handling containers and avoid unnecessary contact with chemical materials. The riverside location provides natural ventilation that minimizes any temporary odors from disposal activities. Any questions regarding these procedures should be directed to shift supervisors or plant management. Compliance with these instructions is mandatory for all production department personnel.
