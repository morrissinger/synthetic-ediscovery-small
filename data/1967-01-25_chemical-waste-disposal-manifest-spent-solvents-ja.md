## WASTE GENERATION SOURCE

The above-described waste solvents were generated during normal manufacturing operations at the Cryovac Division facility for the period of December 15, 1966 through January 20, 1967. These solvents were utilized in the degreasing and cleaning of metal components, film processing operations, and general maintenance activities associated with our plastic film manufacturing processes.

**Process Areas Contributing to Waste:**
- Degreasing Operations (Building A-2)
- Film Processing Lines 1-4 (Building B-1)
- Equipment Maintenance Shop (Building C-3)
- Quality Control Laboratory (Building A-1)

The solvents have become contaminated through use and are no longer suitable for manufacturing purposes. Recovery and reuse operations have been evaluated but determined to be economically unfeasible for this batch due to the level of contamination with metal particles, oils, and organic residues.
