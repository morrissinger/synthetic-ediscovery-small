Plant Manager

Woburn, Massachusetts 01801

Dear Mr. Morrison:

Thank you for your inquiry dated September 5th regarding industrial cleaning solvents for your tannery operations. Northeast Chemical Supply Company is pleased to provide the following quotation for the chemical products specified in your request. Our company has been serving New England's industrial sector since 1949, and we understand the demanding requirements of leather processing and finishing operations.

Based on our telephone conversation and your facility's current cleaning protocols, I am quoting the following industrial-grade solvents for immediate delivery:

**Trichloroethylene (TCE) - Technical Grade**  
- Quantity: 55-gallon drums (minimum order 10 drums)  
- Unit Price: $47.50 per drum  
- Purity: 99.5% minimum  
- Suitable for degreasing leather machinery and equipment cleaning

**Perchloroethylene (PCE) - Industrial Grade**  
- Quantity: 55-gallon drums (minimum order 8 drums)  
- Unit Price: $52.75 per drum  
- Purity: 99.2% minimum  
- Excellent for precision parts cleaning and solvent recovery systems

**1,1,1-Trichloroethane**  
- Quantity: 30-gallon drums (minimum order 12 drums)  
- Unit Price: $38.25 per drum  
- Purity: 99.8% minimum  
- Effective for general cleaning and vapor degreasing applications

All quoted prices are FOB our Lynn facility and include standard steel drum containers. Delivery to your Woburn plant can be arranged within 7-10 business days of order confirmation. Payment terms are Net 30 days for established accounts, with a 2% discount available for payment within 10 days.

These chlorinated solvents represent the most effective cleaning agents available for industrial applications such as yours. TCE and PCE are particularly valued in the leather industry for their superior degreasing properties and ability to remove stubborn residues from processing equipment. The 1,1,1-Trichloroethane offers excellent cleaning power with somewhat lower volatility, making it suitable for open-tank operations where vapor control is a consideration.

Our technical staff recommends implementing proper ventilation systems when using these products, as with any industrial solvent. While these chemicals are widely used throughout Massachusetts manufacturing facilities, we do suggest following standard industrial hygiene practices including adequate workspace ventilation and appropriate personal protective equipment for workers handling the materials directly.

Regarding disposal of spent solvents, many of our customers have found it economical to implement solvent recovery systems, particularly for TCE and PCE operations. However, for waste materials that cannot be recovered, disposal should be arranged through licensed waste handling contractors. We can provide referrals to several reputable firms serving the greater Boston area who specialize in industrial waste management.

This quotation remains valid through October 15, 1974, subject to manufacturer price adjustments. Given the current market conditions and increasing demand for chlorinated solvents, we recommend placing your order promptly to secure these favorable prices. Our inventory levels are currently adequate to fulfill orders of the quantities you specified.

I would be pleased to arrange a site visit to discuss your specific application requirements and review proper handling procedures with your maintenance staff. Northeast Chemical Supply maintains a technical service department staffed by experienced chemical engineers who can provide guidance on optimizing solvent usage and implementing cost-effective cleaning protocols.

Please contact me directly at (617) 598-2420 to place your order or if you require any additional technical information. We appreciate your interest in Northeast Chemical Supply Company and look forward to establishing a long-term business relationship with John J. Riley Company.

Sincerely,

Robert M. Henderson  
Industrial Sales Representative
