# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** CDC Environmental Health Division  
**FROM:** Dr. Richard Clapp, Epidemiologist  
**DATE:** August 25, 1981  
**RE:** Preliminary Assessment of Childhood Leukemia Cluster - Woburn, Massachusetts

## Summary of Findings

Following our initial investigation into the reported childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn, Massachusetts, I am submitting this preliminary assessment for your immediate review. The epidemiological evidence suggests a statistically significant excess of acute lymphocytic leukemia cases among children in the affected area, with a temporal correlation to the operation of municipal Wells G and H.

Between 1969 and 1981, we have documented twelve cases of childhood leukemia in East Woburn, representing an incidence rate approximately 7.5 times higher than expected for a population of this size. The most recent fatality occurred on January 18, 1981, when James Anderson, age 12, succumbed to acute lymphocytic leukemia after a nine-year battle with the disease. James had been diagnosed in January 1972 at age three, shortly after his family moved to 11 Orange Street in 1968, where they received water from the municipal system.

## Geographic and Temporal Distribution

The cluster analysis reveals a clear geographic pattern concentrated in the neighborhoods served by Wells G and H, which began operation in 1964 and 1966 respectively. Affected families include:

- **The Anderson Family** (11 Orange Street): James Anderson, diagnosed 1972, died January 1981
- **The Kane Family**: Kevin Kane Jr., diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia
- **The Zona Family**: Michael Zona, currently undergoing treatment
- **The Toomey Family**: Patrick Toomey, diagnosed 1979
- **The Robbins Family**: Carl Robbins III, acute lymphocytic leukemia
- **The Gamache Family**: Roland Gamache, currently in treatment

The temporal distribution shows the majority of diagnoses occurring after 1970, with a notable increase following the full operation of both wells. This timing coincides with reports from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health regarding water quality concerns in the municipal system.

## Environmental Contamination Evidence

Recent water quality testing has revealed significant contamination in Wells G and H with industrial solvents, specifically:

- **Trichloroethylene (TCE)**: Detected at levels up to 400 parts per billion, far exceeding safe exposure thresholds
- **Tetrachloroethylene (PCE)**: Found at concentrations of 43 parts per billion
- **Additional volatile organic compounds**: Present at various concentrations

These chemicals are known carcinogens with established links to hematological malignancies. The contamination appears to originate from industrial facilities in the area, including operations associated with W.R. Grace Company, Cryovac Inc., Beatrice Foods, and John J. Riley Company. These companies have historically disposed of industrial solvents and chemicals in ways that may have compromised groundwater integrity.

## Public Health Implications

The evidence strongly suggests a causal relationship between the contaminated water supply and the childhood leukemia cluster. The latency period between exposure and disease onset is consistent with known carcinogenic mechanisms for the identified chemicals. Children are particularly vulnerable to these exposures due to their developing immune systems and higher metabolic rates.

Mrs. Anne Anderson, mother of James Anderson, has been instrumental in bringing this cluster to public attention. Her persistence in questioning why so many children in her neighborhood developed leukemia has been crucial to our investigation. The Anderson family's experience—living at the same address for seventeen years and consuming contaminated water throughout James's prenatal development, infancy, and childhood—provides a clear exposure pathway that supports the causation hypothesis.

## Recommendations for Immediate Action

1. **Coordinate with EPA** to expedite comprehensive environmental assessment of contamination sources
2. **Establish medical surveillance program** for all residents who consumed water from Wells G and H
3. **Provide technical assistance** to Massachusetts Department of Public Health for expanded health screening
4. **Document exposure pathways** to support potential legal proceedings by affected families
5. **Initiate community health education** regarding the risks and available medical monitoring

The scientific evidence supports the conclusion that industrial negligence in chemical disposal practices has resulted in groundwater contamination that directly caused this childhood leukemia cluster. The damages to affected families extend beyond medical costs to include pain, suffering, and loss of life. This case will likely serve as a precedent for environmental health litigation and underscores the urgent need for stronger industrial waste disposal regulations.

I recommend immediate escalation of this matter to the Director level, given the potential for significant legal and policy implications. The affected families deserve both comprehensive medical support and accountability from the responsible industrial parties.
