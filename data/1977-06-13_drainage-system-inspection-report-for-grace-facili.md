# DRAINAGE SYSTEM INSPECTION REPORT
## W.R. GRACE COMPANY - WOBURN FACILITY

**TO:** William T. Morrison, Environmental Manager  
**FROM:** Robert M. Henderson, Environmental Technician  
**DATE:** June 13, 1977  
**RE:** Quarterly Drainage System Inspection - Building 15 and Adjacent Areas

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents the findings of the scheduled quarterly inspection of drainage systems serving Building 15 and associated chemical processing areas at the W.R. Grace Company facility located at 201 Montvale Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts. The inspection was conducted on June 10-11, 1977, in accordance with company environmental monitoring protocols established in 1975.

The inspection revealed several areas of concern requiring immediate attention, particularly regarding surface water management and subsurface drainage effectiveness in proximity to chemical storage and waste handling areas.

---

## SITE DESCRIPTION

The inspection area encompasses approximately 12.5 acres of the Grace facility, including:

- Building 15 (Chemical Processing and Storage)
- Adjacent loading dock areas
- Storm water collection systems
- Subsurface drainage network
- Perimeter ditches and swales
- Connection points to municipal storm drainage

The facility sits on glacial outwash soils with high permeability, characterized by sand and gravel deposits typical of the Aberjona River valley. Groundwater depth varies from 8-15 feet below surface across the inspection area.

## METHODOLOGY

### Visual Inspection Protocol
- Systematic examination of all visible drainage structures
- Documentation of surface conditions and flow patterns
- Assessment of structural integrity of pipes and manholes
- Evaluation of sediment accumulation and debris blockages

### Water Quality Observations
- Visual assessment of water clarity and coloration
- Documentation of unusual odors or surface films
- Notation of any visible contamination indicators
- Photographic documentation of anomalous conditions

### Flow Testing
- Measurement of drainage capacity during simulated precipitation events
- Assessment of backup and overflow conditions
- Evaluation of pump station performance
- Documentation of flow direction and velocity

## FINDINGS

### Surface Drainage Systems

**Storm Water Collection:** The primary storm water collection system demonstrates adequate capacity under normal precipitation conditions. However, inspection of catch basins CB-15A through CB-15F revealed significant accumulation of industrial sediments, particularly in areas adjacent to chemical loading operations. Basin CB-15C exhibited a distinctive blue-green discoloration in standing water, accompanied by a petroleum-like odor.

**Parking and Loading Areas:** Surface drainage in the main loading area shows evidence of chemical staining along drainage channels. Concrete surfaces display etching patterns consistent with exposure to acidic solutions. Several areas show rainbow-colored surface films on standing water after recent precipitation.

### Subsurface Drainage Network

**French Drain System:** The French drain installation completed in 1972 along the eastern perimeter of Building 15 continues to function, though flow rates have decreased approximately 30% since initial installation. Inspection ports reveal accumulated sediment with metallic sheen and chemical odors.

**Perforated Pipe Network:** The 8-inch perforated pipe system serving the chemical storage area shows signs of chemical degradation. Several joints exhibit leakage, and pipe sections display internal corrosion. Flow testing indicates reduced capacity in the southeastern section.

### Connection to Municipal Systems

**Storm Drain Outfall:** The facility's storm drainage connects to the municipal system via a 24-inch concrete pipe at the northwestern property boundary. This connection point shows evidence of chemical residue buildup and requires cleaning. Flow from this outfall ultimately reaches the Aberjona River via the municipal storm water network.

**Groundwater Interface:** Monitoring wells MW-3 and MW-4, installed in 1976, show water levels consistent with seasonal variations. However, visual inspection reveals slight discoloration in MW-4, suggesting potential interaction between surface drainage and groundwater systems.

## SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS

### Building 15 Perimeter
- **North Side:** Concrete apron shows chemical staining in 3-foot wide band along building foundation
- **East Side:** French drain outfall exhibits blue-green staining on discharge rocks
- **South Side:** Loading dock area shows oil stains and chemical residue in drainage channels
- **West Side:** Parking area drainage functions normally with no visible contamination

### Chemical Storage Areas
- **Tank Farm:** Secondary containment systems show minor leakage at drain connections
- **Drum Storage:** Concrete pad drainage exhibits staining consistent with solvent exposure
- **Waste Staging Area:** Temporary storage area lacks adequate drainage; standing water observed

### Pump Stations
- **Station P-1:** Operating normally, though increased maintenance required due to sediment buildup
- **Station P-2:** Intermittent operation noted; chemical residue affecting pump seals

---

## LABORATORY ANALYSIS RECOMMENDATIONS

While visual inspection provides valuable information, several observations warrant laboratory analysis to determine the nature and extent of chemical constituents in drainage waters:

1. **Water samples from catch basins CB-15C, CB-15E, and CB-15F** for analysis of:
   - Total dissolved solids
   - pH levels
   - Heavy metals content
   - Volatile organic compounds

2. **Sediment samples from French drain inspection ports** for:
   - Chemical composition analysis
   - Heavy metals concentration
   - Organic compound identification

3. **Groundwater samples from monitoring wells MW-3 and MW-4** for baseline comparison

---

## MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS

### Immediate Actions Required (Within 30 Days)
1. Clean and flush catch basins CB-15A through CB-15F
2. Remove accumulated sediment from French drain system
3. Repair leaking joints in perforated pipe network
4. Clean chemical residue from municipal connection point

### Preventive Maintenance (Within 90 Days)
1. Install additional catch basins in chemical loading areas
2. Upgrade secondary containment drainage in tank farm
3. Implement regular cleaning schedule for all drainage systems
4. Install sediment traps in high-contamination areas

### Long-term Improvements (Within 12 Months)
1. Consider installation of oil-water separator systems
2. Evaluate need for chemical treatment of drainage water
3. Upgrade pump stations with chemical-resistant components
4. Install additional monitoring points in drainage network

---

## REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

The observed conditions should be evaluated in the context of applicable environmental regulations:

- **Massachusetts Water Pollution Control Act:** Discharge quality standards
- **Federal Water Pollution Control Act:** Storm water discharge requirements
- **Local Ordinances:** Municipal storm drain connection requirements

Regular monitoring and documentation of drainage system performance will support compliance with evolving environmental regulations and demonstrate due diligence in environmental management.

---

## CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The drainage system inspection reveals a functional but stressed infrastructure requiring immediate attention to prevent environmental impact. The combination of chemical staining, sediment accumulation, and equipment degradation indicates that current drainage systems are inadequate for the chemical processing operations they serve.

**Priority Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate containment** of visible chemical contamination in drainage systems
2. **Laboratory analysis** of water and sediment samples to characterize contamination
3. **Upgrade of drainage infrastructure** to handle chemical processing byproducts
4. **Implementation of regular monitoring program** to track system performance
5. **Development of spill response procedures** specific to drainage system contamination

The facility's proximity to municipal water supply wells and the Aberjona River watershed necessitates prompt action to address identified deficiencies. Continued operation without remediation may result in off-site environmental impact and regulatory compliance issues.
