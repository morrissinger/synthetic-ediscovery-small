## MEDICAL HISTORY INTERVIEW SUMMARY

### Initial Presentation and Early Symptoms

Mrs. Anne Anderson provided detailed recollections of her son James's illness progression during this comprehensive interview. According to maternal history, James was a healthy infant and toddler with no significant medical problems until approximately age 4 years, 8 months (May 1971). Mrs. Anderson recalls that James first complained of persistent fatigue and loss of appetite in late spring 1971. Initially attributed to normal childhood variations, these symptoms gradually intensified over several weeks.

The first concerning physical manifestation occurred in June 1971 when Mrs. Anderson noticed unusual bruising on James's arms and legs without corresponding trauma. She specifically recalls purple-blue bruises appearing on his shins and forearms that seemed disproportionate to normal childhood play activities. Concurrent with the bruising, James developed recurrent nosebleeds, initially dismissed by the family pediatrician as seasonal allergies common to the Woburn area.

By July 1971, James's condition had deteriorated noticeably. Mrs. Anderson described her son as appearing increasingly pale and listless, often requesting to rest during activities he had previously enjoyed. The family resided at 96 Maple Street in East Woburn, directly within the service area of municipal Wells G and H, which had been operational since 1964 and 1966 respectively. The Anderson family had consumed water from these wells continuously since moving to their Maple Street residence in 1965.

### Clinical Course and Diagnosis

In August 1971, concerned by James's persistent symptoms and physical deterioration, Mrs. Anderson brought him to Winchester Hospital for comprehensive evaluation. Initial laboratory studies revealed significant abnormalities in his complete blood count, including severe anemia with hemoglobin levels of 6.2 g/dL (normal range 11.5-13.5 g/dL for his age group) and marked thrombocytopenia with platelet counts of 28,000/μL (normal range 150,000-400,000/μL).

Peripheral blood smear examination revealed the presence of blast cells, prompting immediate referral to pediatric hematology-oncology specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital. Bone marrow biopsy performed on August 24, 1971, confirmed the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common form of childhood leukemia but nonetheless a devastating diagnosis for a previously healthy 4-year-old child.

Dr. Robert Weinstein, the treating pediatric oncologist at Mass General, initiated standard chemotherapy protocols available in 1971, including vincristine, prednisone, and methotrexate. Mrs. Anderson recalls the aggressive nature of the treatment regimen and James's brave but ultimately unsuccessful battle against the disease. Despite initial partial remission achieved in late 1971, James experienced relapse in December 1971 with central nervous system involvement.

### Environmental Exposure History

During this interview, Mrs. Anderson provided detailed information regarding the family's residential history and potential environmental exposures. The Anderson family moved to 96 Maple Street in East Woburn in March 1965, when James was approximately 6 months old. Their water supply came exclusively from the East Woburn municipal system, which included Wells G and H as primary sources during James's early childhood years.

Mrs. Anderson recalls that the family consumed municipal tap water for all household purposes, including drinking water, cooking, and preparation of infant formula during James's early infancy. She specifically remembers noticing occasional unusual tastes and odors in their tap water, particularly during summer months, but attributed these to normal seasonal variations. The family did not use bottled water or filtration systems, as was common practice in the community during the 1960s and early 1970s.

The Anderson residence was located approximately 0.8 miles southeast of Wells G and H, placing them directly within the primary service area for water from these sources. Mrs. Anderson confirmed that James spent his entire early childhood in this residence, with no significant periods of absence that would have reduced his exposure to the municipal water supply.

### Treatment Response and Terminal Course

Following diagnosis, James underwent intensive chemotherapy treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital under Dr. Weinstein's care. Mrs. Anderson described periods of hope during partial remission phases alternating with devastating setbacks as the disease progressed. The treatment regimen in 1971-1972 was less advanced than current protocols, and childhood leukemia carried a significantly poorer prognosis than would be expected today.

James's condition deteriorated rapidly following CNS relapse in December 1971. Mrs. Anderson recalls her son's increasing weakness, recurrent infections due to chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression, and ultimately the development of complications that proved fatal. James Anderson died on January 21, 1972, at Massachusetts General Hospital, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia listed as the primary cause of death on his death certificate.

### Impact on Family and Community Concerns

Mrs. Anderson expressed during this interview her growing awareness of similar cases among neighborhood children. She specifically mentioned learning of other childhood leukemia diagnoses in the East Woburn area, including Kevin Kane Jr., who lived on nearby Pine Street, and Michael Zona from the same general neighborhood. This pattern of cases within a geographically concentrated area raised her concerns about potential environmental causation.

The family incurred substantial medical expenses during James's illness, including costs for specialized treatment, medications, and travel to Boston for care. Mrs. Anderson estimated total out-of-pocket medical costs exceeded $15,000 during the treatment period, representing a significant financial burden for the family. Additionally, she described the emotional devastation of losing a young child and the lasting impact on family dynamics and her marriage.

## CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND OBSERVATIONS

Based on this comprehensive interview and review of available medical records, James Anderson's case represents a typical presentation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with standard clinical course for the early 1970s treatment era. However, the geographic clustering of similar cases in East Woburn, combined with the documented contamination of Wells G and H discovered in 1979, raises significant questions regarding potential environmental causation.

The temporal relationship between James's residence in the Wells G and H service area from early infancy through diagnosis, combined with the established presence of trichloroethylene and other organic solvents in the municipal water supply during this period, warrants continued investigation as part of the broader childhood leukemia cluster study.
