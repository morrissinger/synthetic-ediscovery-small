### DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES - OCTOBER 1972

**October 2, 1972:** Four drums (RLY-A15 through RLY-A18) transported to rear property area for temporary storage. Contents: mixed TCE waste and cleaning solvents, approximately 200 gallons total. Drums placed in excavated area behind main building per standard procedure.

**October 9, 1972:** Six drums from September inventory moved to back lot storage. Weather conditions dry, suitable for outdoor placement. Area supervisor J. Murphy authorized relocation to make room for incoming waste from increased production schedule.

**October 16, 1972:** Disposal contractor failed to appear for scheduled pickup. Rescheduled for October 30. Additional drums (RLY-B02, showing bottom corrosion) moved to temporary outdoor storage to prevent facility contamination. Contents transferred to new container RLY-C01.

**October 21, 1972:** Emergency disposal of leaking drum RLY-004. Contents (mixed solvents, approximately 50 gallons) absorbed with sawdust and sand. Contaminated absorbent material placed in excavated area behind building. Area covered with clean fill as per company policy.

### OPERATIONAL NOTES

**Storage Capacity:** Current storage areas operating at 85% capacity. Recommend expansion of Storage Area B or acceleration of disposal schedule to accommodate increased waste generation from new contracts.

**Container Condition:** Three drums showing signs of deterioration (RLY-002, RLY-004, RLY-B02). Contents of severely compromised containers transferred to new drums when possible. Damaged containers disposed of in rear property area.

**Weather Considerations:** Recent dry conditions favorable for outdoor storage activities. Ground conditions stable for heavy drum placement. No standing water in temporary storage areas.

**Production Impact:** Increased manufacturing activity due to new government contracts has resulted in 40% increase in chemical waste generation compared to August 1972. Current disposal contractor scheduling inadequate for increased volume.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Schedule additional disposal contractor pickup for November 1972
   - Inspect all drums in Storage Area B for container integrity
   - Order additional 55-gallon drums for transfer of compromised containers

2. **Medium-term Planning:**
   - Expand Storage Area B capacity by 50% to accommodate production increases
   - Establish secondary disposal contractor relationship for backup services
   - Implement weekly drum inspection protocol

3. **Cost Considerations:**
   - Current disposal costs: $0.15 per gallon for mixed solvents, $0.20 per gallon for pure TCE
   - On-site temporary storage reduces immediate disposal costs while maintaining operational flexibility
   - Rear property storage area adequate for seasonal disposal schedule adjustments

---

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All disposal activities conducted in accordance with current Massachusetts industrial waste regulations. No specific permits required for temporary on-site storage of industrial solvents in containers under 1,000 gallons total capacity. Company maintains compliance with local fire department notifications for hazardous material storage.

**Next Review Date:** November 15, 1972
