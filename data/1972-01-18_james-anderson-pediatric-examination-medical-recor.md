## CHIEF COMPLAINT

Mother reports child has been experiencing unusual fatigue and paleness for approximately three weeks. Patient has been complaining of leg pain, particularly at night, and has shown decreased appetite and energy levels significantly below normal for his age group.

## HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Anderson states that James has been increasingly lethargic over the past month, with symptoms becoming more pronounced in the last three weeks. The child, normally very active and energetic, has been refusing to play outside and has been taking frequent naps during the day. Mother notes that James has complained of "hurting legs" on multiple occasions, particularly in the evening hours, describing the pain as "achy" and pointing to his shins and thighs.

The patient has also exhibited a marked decrease in appetite, eating approximately half his normal portions at meals. Mrs. Anderson reports that James has been unusually irritable and has had difficulty sleeping through the night due to leg discomfort. No fever has been observed, though mother notes the child feels "cooler than usual" to the touch.

Family has been residing at current address since 1968. No recent travel or exposure to infectious diseases reported. No known allergies to medications or foods.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

**Vital Signs:**
- Temperature: 98.2°F (oral)
- Pulse: 88 beats per minute
- Respiration: 22 breaths per minute
- Blood Pressure: 95/60 mmHg
- Weight: 34 lbs (15th percentile for age)
- Height: 40 inches (25th percentile for age)

**General Appearance:**
Patient appears pale and somewhat listless. Cooperative during examination but shows less energy and engagement than typical for age group. Notable pallor of skin and mucous membranes observed.

**Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat:**
Normocephalic, atraumatic. Conjunctiva notably pale. Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Ears clear bilaterally. Throat shows no erythema or exudate. Lymph nodes palpable in cervical and axillary regions, measuring approximately 1.5 cm, mobile and non-tender.

**Cardiovascular:**
Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs detected. Peripheral pulses present but somewhat weak.

**Respiratory:**
Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Respiratory effort appears normal.

**Abdomen:**
Soft, non-distended. Mild tenderness noted in left upper quadrant. Spleen palpable 2 cm below left costal margin. Liver edge palpable 1 cm below right costal margin. No masses detected.

**Musculoskeletal:**
Patient exhibits tenderness in bilateral lower extremities, particularly over tibial and femoral regions. No obvious swelling or deformity noted. Range of motion appears normal despite reported discomfort.

**Skin:**
Marked pallor noted throughout. Several small bruises observed on arms and legs, which mother attributes to normal childhood activities. No rash or other skin lesions present.

## LABORATORY STUDIES ORDERED

Given the constellation of symptoms including fatigue, pallor, lymphadenopathy, and bone pain, have ordered the following studies:

- Complete Blood Count with differential
- Peripheral blood smear
- Reticulocyte count
- Serum iron and iron-binding capacity
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate

Blood drawn today by venipuncture. Results to be available within 48 hours.

## ASSESSMENT AND CLINICAL IMPRESSION

**Primary Concern:** The combination of symptoms - progressive fatigue, pallor, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone pain in a previously healthy child - raises significant concern for hematologic malignancy, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
1. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (most concerning given symptom complex)
2. Iron deficiency anemia
3. Aplastic anemia
4. Viral syndrome with secondary anemia
5. Other hematologic disorders

## PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate:** Await laboratory results. Will contact family within 24-48 hours with findings.

2. **Follow-up:** Depending on laboratory results, may require immediate referral to pediatric hematology-oncology at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Boston.

3. **Symptomatic Care:** Continue monitoring symptoms. Encourage adequate rest and nutrition. Avoid aspirin-containing medications. Contact office immediately if fever develops or symptoms worsen.

4. **Parent Education:** Discussed concerns with Mrs. Anderson regarding the need for comprehensive evaluation. Explained that while several conditions could cause these symptoms, the combination warrants urgent investigation.

## PARENTAL CONCERNS DISCUSSED

Mrs. Anderson expressed significant worry about James's condition and asked specifically about possible environmental causes. She mentioned that several other children in the neighborhood have seemed "sickly" recently and wondered if there might be a common cause. Advised that we will focus on determining James's specific condition first, then consider any broader environmental factors if indicated.

Mother was counseled about the importance of close monitoring and prompt follow-up. Provided with after-hours contact information and instructions to return immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.

## NEXT STEPS

Will review laboratory results as soon as available and contact family immediately. If initial studies suggest hematologic malignancy, will arrange urgent consultation with Dr. Margaret Thompson at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology.

**Patient exhibits signs consistent with serious systemic illness requiring immediate comprehensive evaluation and likely subspecialty care.**
