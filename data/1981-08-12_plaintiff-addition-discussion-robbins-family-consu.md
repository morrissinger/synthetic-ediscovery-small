## **Agenda Item 1: Background Review - Carl Robbins III Case**

### Discussion:
Attorney Schlichtmann opened the meeting by expressing condolences to the Robbins family for the loss of their son, Carl Robbins III, who died on March 14, 1981, at the age of seven from acute lymphocytic leukemia. The family resides at 47 Salem Street in Woburn, Massachusetts, where they have lived since 1971.

Mr. Robbins confirmed that their family had been receiving municipal water from Wells G and H since moving to Salem Street. Mrs. Robbins stated that Carl III was born on September 22, 1973, and was diagnosed with leukemia in February 1979 at the age of five. The child underwent treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital under Dr. Patricia Morrison's care for over two years before succumbing to the disease.

### Key Facts Established:
- Residence: 47 Salem Street, Woburn, MA (1971-present)
- Water source: Municipal Wells G and H throughout Carl III's lifetime
- Birth date: September 22, 1973

## **Agenda Item 2: Water Consumption and Exposure History**

### Discussion:
Mrs. Robbins provided detailed information regarding the family's water usage patterns. She confirmed that during her pregnancy with Carl III (1973), she consumed tap water exclusively from their Salem Street residence. The family used municipal water for all domestic purposes including drinking, cooking, bathing, and formula preparation during Carl III's infancy.

Mr. Robbins noted that he had observed occasional discoloration and unusual taste in their tap water, particularly during summer months between 1975-1979, but had been assured by city officials that the water met all safety standards.

### Exposure Timeline:
- **Prenatal exposure:** 1973 (Mrs. Robbins' pregnancy)
- **Infant/toddler exposure:** 1973-1976 (formula preparation, drinking water)
- **Childhood exposure:** 1976-1981 (continued daily consumption)
- **Noted water quality issues:** 1975-1979 (discoloration, taste anomalies)

## **Agenda Item 3: Legal Viability Assessment**

### Discussion:
Attorney Schlichtmann reviewed the potential legal claims available to the Robbins family, drawing parallels to the Anderson case filed earlier this year. The discussion focused on three primary legal theories:

**Wrongful Death Claim:** Based on Carl III's death resulting from alleged contamination of municipal water supply by industrial defendants W.R. Grace Company, Beatrice Foods, Cryovac Inc., and John J. Riley Company.

**Negligence Theory:** Industrial defendants' failure to properly contain and dispose of toxic chemicals (trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene), resulting in groundwater contamination affecting Wells G and H.

**Causation Elements:** Establishing the link between contaminated water consumption and Carl III's development of acute lymphocytic leukemia, supported by epidemiological evidence of the childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn.

### Legal Considerations:
- Statute of limitations: Within allowable timeframe (death occurred March 1981)
- Damages: Medical expenses, pain and suffering, loss of companionship
- Expert testimony requirements: Medical causation, environmental contamination
- Discovery needs: Industrial records, EPA testing data, medical records

## **Agenda Item 4: Case Strategy and Coordination**

### Discussion:
Attorney Schlichtmann outlined the strategic advantages of consolidating the Robbins case with existing plaintiff Anne Anderson and other affected families. The clustering of cases strengthens the epidemiological evidence and creates economies of scale for expert witness costs and discovery efforts.

Conway noted that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has documented elevated leukemia rates in the East Woburn area, which supports the causation arguments across all cases. The EPA's ongoing investigation of Wells G and H contamination provides additional regulatory support for plaintiff claims.

### Strategic Elements:
- **Case consolidation:** Joint discovery, shared expert witnesses
- **Regulatory support:** EPA findings, Mass. DPH health studies
- **Community impact:** Multiple affected families strengthen causation claims
- **Resource efficiency:** Shared litigation costs across plaintiff group
