# WORK DIRECTIVE

**TO:** Thomas F. O'Brien, Facility Cleaning Crew Chief  
**FROM:** Harold J. Mitchell, Production Supervisor  
**DATE:** April 28, 1965  
**RE:** Updated Procedures for Degreasing Solvent Disposal Operations

## Directive Summary

Effective immediately, all facility cleaning crew personnel are to implement the revised disposal procedures for spent degreasing solvents and related chemical waste materials generated from our packaging film production operations. These procedures are necessary to maintain operational efficiency and ensure proper handling of industrial waste materials in accordance with our current facility management protocols.

## Background and Rationale

Our packaging film production line generates approximately 200-300 gallons per month of spent degreasing solvents, primarily trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), along with various cleaning agents used in equipment maintenance. The current storage capacity in our designated waste holding area has reached maximum utilization, and we require immediate implementation of disposal procedures to maintain uninterrupted production schedules.

The revised procedures outlined below have been developed in consultation with plant management to ensure cost-effective waste handling while maintaining compliance with our operational requirements. These procedures will allow for timely removal of accumulated waste materials and prevent any disruption to our manufacturing operations.

## Revised Disposal Procedures

**Daily Operations:**
- All spent degreasing solvents are to be collected in standard 55-gallon drums marked with production date and contents
- Drums shall be staged in the rear loading area adjacent to the eastern property boundary
- Full drums are to be transported via company truck to the designated disposal area located approximately 500 yards east of the main facility
- Disposal operations shall be conducted during evening hours (after 6:00 PM) to minimize interference with regular production activities

**Disposal Site Operations:**
- The designated disposal area consists of the excavated pit located on company property east of the facility near the tree line
- Solvent materials are to be emptied directly into the excavated area in quantities not exceeding 100 gallons per disposal operation
- Empty drums are to be returned to the facility for reuse in subsequent waste collection operations
- All disposal activities are to be logged in the daily operations record with date, time, and approximate quantities

**Personnel Assignments:**
- Primary disposal crew: Robert Sullivan, James McCarthy, Anthony DiMarco
- Backup personnel: Frank Kowalski, Michael Torrino
- All disposal operations require minimum of two crew members for safety and efficiency
- Crew chief O'Brien to maintain oversight of all disposal activities and ensure compliance with these procedures

## Safety and Operational Considerations

Personnel conducting disposal operations are reminded that these industrial solvents require careful handling. While these materials are commonly used throughout our industry, proper ventilation and minimal skin contact are recommended during handling procedures. The disposal site has been selected for its distance from facility buildings and its location in an area with natural drainage characteristics that will facilitate proper dispersion of waste materials.

The excavated disposal pit provides adequate capacity for our current waste generation rates and allows for natural soil filtration of disposed materials. This method has proven effective at similar facilities and represents the most practical solution for our waste handling requirements given our current operational constraints and budget considerations.

## Implementation Timeline and Reporting

These revised procedures are to be implemented immediately upon receipt of this directive. All facility cleaning crew personnel are required to acknowledge receipt and understanding of these procedures by signing the attached acknowledgment form and returning it to my office no later than May 3, 1965.

Weekly disposal reports are to be submitted to my office each Friday, documenting the total quantities of materials disposed, any operational issues encountered, and recommendations for procedural improvements. These reports will be maintained in our facility operations files and will serve as the basis for any future modifications to our waste handling procedures.

Any questions regarding these procedures should be directed to my office immediately. Compliance with these directives is mandatory and essential for maintaining our production schedules and facility operations.
