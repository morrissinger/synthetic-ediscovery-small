# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Department Director  
**FROM:** Communications Division  
**DATE:** April 8, 1981  
**RE:** Media Response Strategy for East Woburn Health Study and Recent Anderson Death

## Background

Following the January 18th death of James Anderson and increasing media attention surrounding the childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn, our department has received seventeen inquiries from local and regional media outlets requesting comment on our ongoing health study. The Boston Globe, Woburn Daily Times, and WCVB-TV have been particularly persistent in seeking official statements regarding the potential connection between municipal Wells G and H and the elevated incidence of childhood leukemia in the Pine Street area.

The Anderson family, particularly Anne Anderson of 11 Orange Street, has become increasingly vocal about her son's nine-year battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia and has begun making public statements linking his death to contaminated drinking water. Mrs. Anderson has contacted several media outlets and is reportedly considering legal action against multiple industrial defendants. This situation requires careful management to balance public health transparency with legal and regulatory considerations.

## Current Media Landscape

Our analysis indicates that public awareness of the East Woburn situation has increased significantly since the Anderson death. The proximity of the affected neighborhood to Wells G and H, combined with the temporal correlation between the wells' opening dates (1964 and 1966) and the onset of childhood leukemia cases, has created a compelling narrative for media coverage. Local reporters have begun investigating the industrial history of the area, particularly focusing on facilities operated by W.R. Grace Company, Cryovac Inc., and other manufacturers in the vicinity of the municipal wellfield.

The challenge we face is maintaining scientific credibility while acknowledging legitimate community health concerns. Our preliminary data suggests an unusual clustering of childhood leukemia cases, but we must avoid premature conclusions that could compromise ongoing investigations or create unnecessary public alarm. Simultaneously, we cannot appear dismissive of genuine health threats or insensitive to the grief of affected families like the Andersons.

## Recommended Response Strategy

I recommend we adopt a measured approach emphasizing our commitment to thorough scientific investigation while expressing appropriate concern for affected families. Our public statements should acknowledge the tragic loss of James Anderson and other children while emphasizing that determining causation requires comprehensive epidemiological analysis. We should highlight our collaboration with federal agencies, including the EPA, to ensure that all potential environmental factors are properly evaluated.

Moving forward, all media inquiries should be directed through this office to ensure consistent messaging. We must be prepared for increased scrutiny as additional families potentially come forward, and we should anticipate that legal proceedings may generate additional media attention. Our response must demonstrate both scientific rigor and genuine concern for public health protection.

**Action Items:**
- Prepare standardized media response template by April 15th
- Coordinate with legal counsel regarding potential litigation implications
- Schedule briefing with epidemiology team on study timeline
- Establish regular communication protocol with EPA representatives
