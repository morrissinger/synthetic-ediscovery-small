# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Woburn Board of Health  
**FROM:** Charles F. McKenna, Director, Woburn Water Commission  
**DATE:** February 28, 1976  
**RE:** Water Quality Testing Protocol Review and Recommendations

## Current Testing Protocols Assessment

Following recent discussions regarding water quality concerns in the East Woburn service area, I have conducted a comprehensive review of our current testing protocols for municipal Wells G and H. Our present testing schedule adheres to Massachusetts Department of Public Health minimum requirements, with bacteriological testing conducted monthly and chemical analysis performed quarterly. Standard parameters include pH, chlorine residual, turbidity, and basic mineral content measurements.

Wells G and H, commissioned in 1964 and 1966 respectively, currently supply approximately 40% of Woburn's municipal water demand, serving primarily the eastern residential districts including Montvale Road, Salem Street, and adjacent neighborhoods. These wells draw from the glacial outwash aquifer at depths of 60 and 80 feet, with combined daily capacity of 2.8 million gallons. Both installations utilize standard chlorination treatment before distribution through the municipal system.

## Identified Areas for Protocol Enhancement

Recent community inquiries have highlighted the need for expanded testing parameters, particularly regarding industrial chemical compounds that may be present in groundwater sources. While our current protocols satisfy regulatory requirements, enhanced monitoring would provide additional assurance to residents and demonstrate the Commission's commitment to water safety. I recommend implementing semi-annual testing for volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethylene and related industrial solvents, given the industrial activity in the broader watershed area.

Additionally, we should consider establishing a more systematic approach to taste and odor complaints, which have increased in frequency over the past eighteen months. While these complaints may reflect seasonal variations in groundwater chemistry, proper documentation and investigation would help identify any emerging quality issues before they become significant public health concerns.

## Implementation Recommendations

The proposed enhanced testing protocol would require an additional annual budget allocation of approximately $3,200, representing a modest investment in public health protection. I recommend coordinating with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to ensure our expanded testing program aligns with evolving state guidelines and best practices. The Commission should also establish clear procedures for communicating test results to the Board of Health and, when appropriate, to affected residents.

I am prepared to discuss these recommendations in detail at the Board's next regular meeting and can provide cost estimates for various testing scenarios. The health and safety of Woburn residents remains our primary responsibility, and these protocol enhancements would strengthen our ability to fulfill that duty effectively.
