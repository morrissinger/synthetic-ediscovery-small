**SCHLICHTMANN:** This interview is being conducted on November 5th, 1981, at 9:00 AM in connection with the matter of Anderson versus W.R. Grace and Company and others. Present are myself, Jan Schlichtmann, attorney for the plaintiffs, and Robert F. Kellerman, former employee of W.R. Grace. Mr. Kellerman, you understand that this interview is voluntary and that you are not under oath, but that the information you provide may be used in legal proceedings?

**KELLERMAN:** Yes, I understand that. I want to be clear from the start that I'm coming forward because what I witnessed at that plant troubled me for years, especially after hearing about those children in Woburn.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Thank you. Could you please state your full name and describe your employment history with W.R. Grace?

**KELLERMAN:** Robert Francis Kellerman. I worked for W.R. Grace at their Cryovac facility on New Boston Street in Woburn from March 1967 until I was laid off in September 1979. I started as a machine operator and worked my way up to plant supervisor by 1974.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** In your capacity as plant supervisor, what were your responsibilities regarding waste disposal?

**KELLERMAN:** Well, that's where things get complicated. Officially, I was supposed to oversee production operations, but in reality, I ended up dealing with a lot of the waste issues because nobody else wanted to handle them. The Cryovac operation generated substantial amounts of chemical waste—primarily trichloroethylene, which we called TCE, and tetrachloroethylene, or perc. These were used as solvents in our plastic film manufacturing process.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Can you describe the volume of these chemicals that were used and disposed of?

**KELLERMAN:** We went through drums and drums of the stuff. I'd estimate we used maybe 200 to 300 gallons of TCE per week during peak production periods. The perc usage was lower, maybe 50 to 75 gallons weekly. But here's the thing—not all of it was consumed in the process. We always had waste solvents, contaminated batches, cleaning residues. The company policy was supposed to be that all chemical waste would be properly disposed of through licensed contractors.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Was that policy followed?

**KELLERMAN:** *[Long pause]* No, it wasn't. Not consistently. And that's what's been eating at me all these years. Starting around 1970, maybe 1971, there was increasing pressure from corporate to cut disposal costs. Proper hazardous waste disposal was expensive—we're talking about maybe $200 to $300 per drum to have it hauled away and incinerated properly.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** What alternatives were used?

**KELLERMAN:** This is the part that's hard for me to talk about, but I think people need to know. There were several practices that I witnessed that were clearly improper. First, there was a lagoon behind the plant—we called it the settling pond—where liquid wastes were discharged. It wasn't lined, just excavated earth. I was told by management that it was acceptable for "biodegradable" wastes, but I saw TCE and other solvents going in there.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Who made the decision to use this lagoon for chemical disposal?

**KELLERMAN:** The directive came from the plant manager, Frank Morrison, but he said he was acting on orders from the regional office. Morrison told me directly in 1972 that corporate had made it clear that disposal costs needed to be reduced by at least 40 percent. He said, and I remember this clearly, "Bob, we need to find more economical solutions for our waste streams."

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Were there other improper disposal methods?

**KELLERMAN:** Yes. There was also direct discharge to the storm drain system. I witnessed this personally on multiple occasions between 1973 and 1976. Workers would pour waste solvents down floor drains that I knew connected to the storm sewer system. When I raised concerns about this with Morrison, he told me that the chemicals would be "diluted to safe levels" by the time they reached any water source.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Did you ever document these practices or report them to environmental authorities?

**KELLERMAN:** I kept some informal notes in my daily log books, but nothing official. As for reporting to authorities, that wasn't really an option for someone in my position. Environmental regulations were less developed then, and challenging company practices could cost you your job. I had a family to support and a mortgage to pay.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Were you aware of the municipal water wells in the area?

**KELLERMAN:** I knew there were city wells somewhere to the east of our facility, but I wasn't told exactly where they were located. It wasn't until after I left the company that I learned Wells G and H were so close to our plant—maybe 1,500 feet from our disposal areas. If I had known that, I would have been much more vocal about the disposal practices I was witnessing.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Can you describe any specific incidents where large quantities of chemicals were improperly disposed of?

**KELLERMAN:** There was one incident in particular that still bothers me. It was in the summer of 1975. We had a batch of contaminated TCE—maybe 500 gallons—that had been mixed with other chemicals and couldn't be reused in production. The proper disposal cost was quoted at over $2,000. Instead, Morrison ordered it to be "diluted and discharged" to the lagoon over the course of several days. I objected, saying that much TCE could contaminate groundwater, but he overruled me.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Were there any safety protocols in place for workers handling these chemicals?

**KELLERMAN:** The safety measures were minimal, especially in the early years. We had some basic protective equipment—gloves, goggles—but there was no comprehensive training about the health effects of prolonged exposure to TCE or perc. I remember reading the material safety data sheets and being concerned about the warnings regarding cancer risks, but management downplayed these concerns.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Did you ever experience health problems that you attributed to chemical exposure?

**KELLERMAN:** I developed respiratory problems in the mid-1970s that my doctor couldn't fully explain. I also had persistent headaches and fatigue. I can't prove it was related to chemical exposure, but the symptoms improved significantly after I left W.R. Grace.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Are you aware of other employees who might have witnessed improper disposal practices?

**KELLERMAN:** Yes, several people saw what I saw. Tom Bradley was a maintenance worker who was involved in some of the disposal operations. Mary Sullivan worked in quality control and would have known about contaminated batches being disposed of improperly. There were others, but I don't know if they'd be willing to come forward.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Mr. Kellerman, based on your experience and observations, do you believe W.R. Grace knew that their disposal practices could potentially contaminate local groundwater?

**KELLERMAN:** I believe they had to know. The material safety data sheets clearly stated that TCE and perc could contaminate groundwater and pose health risks. Any reasonable person in a supervisory position would understand that dumping these chemicals in an unlined lagoon or into storm drains could lead to groundwater contamination. The fact that they chose cheaper disposal methods despite these known risks suggests they prioritized cost savings over environmental protection.

**SCHLICHTMANN:** Is there anything else you think is important for us to know about the disposal practices at the W.R. Grace
