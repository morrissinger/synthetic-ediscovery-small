# November 20, 1955

Another long day at the tannery. The smell gets worse each week, seems like. Today I had to help Tommy and Frank move the waste barrels again - third time this month they've asked us to relocate them. Started thinking about where exactly we've been putting all this chemical waste over the years, and it's got me troubled.

Been working for Mr. Riley since 1947, right after I got back from the service. Good steady work, and Mr. Riley's always been fair with wages and such. But lately I've been noticing things that don't sit right with me. The way we handle the waste from the tanning process - all those chemicals we use to treat the hides - it just gets dumped out back behind the facility. Some of it goes in barrels, some gets poured right into the ground. Mr. Riley says it's the way his father did it and his father before him, going back to when they started this operation in 1909.

But I've been reading in the newspapers about how some of these chemicals might not be as harmless as we thought. There was an article in the Boston Globe last month about industrial waste and water supplies. Got me thinking about that marshy area behind our property where we've been dumping waste for decades. Water table can't be too far down in that soft ground, especially with the Aberjona River running so close by. When it rains heavy, you can see the runoff flowing toward the river, and it's got that chemical smell to it.

Today when we were moving those barrels, I noticed some of them were leaking. Dark, oily liquid seeping into the soil. Frank just shrugged and said "ground'll take care of it," but I'm not so sure anymore. We use so many different chemicals in the tanning process - chromium compounds, sulfuric acid, various solvents for cleaning and degreasing. Some of those barrels have been sitting out there for years. The older ones are rusted through in places.

I tried talking to Mr. Riley about it last week, suggested maybe we should look into proper disposal methods. He got that look on his face like I was questioning forty-six years of family business. Said the tannery's been operating the same way since his father started it, never had any problems before. Reminded me that jobs are hard to come by, and the tannery provides good work for a lot of families in East Woburn. Can't argue with that - we've got twenty-three men working here full time, and most of us have families depending on these paychecks.

But still, it bothers me. Especially when I think about all the families living in the neighborhoods around here. The Andersons just had another baby - little James, I think they named him. Sweet family. They live maybe half a mile from here, and I know they get their water from the city wells. Makes me wonder if there's any connection between where we're dumping our waste and where folks are getting their drinking water.

The thing is, I don't really know what the right thing to do is. If I push too hard on this waste disposal issue, I might lose my job. And if I lose my job, Mary and the kids suffer. But if we keep dumping chemicals the way we have been, and it turns out that's causing problems for other families... well, that doesn't sit right either.

Tommy mentioned today that his wife's been complaining about the taste of their tap water lately. Says it's got a funny metallic flavor to it sometimes. Could be nothing - old pipes, maybe. But it got me wondering. We're not the only industrial operation in this area. There's other businesses doing similar work, probably handling waste the same way we do.

I keep thinking about my duty - to my family, to my employer, to my community. Mr. Riley's been good to me, and loyalty means something. But what if being loyal to him means being disloyal to my neighbors? What if the way we've been handling waste for all these years is actually causing harm that we just haven't recognized yet?

Maybe I'm worrying over nothing. Maybe the ground really can handle all these chemicals without any problems. Maybe I've been reading too many newspaper articles and getting myself worked up. But I can't shake the feeling that we ought to be more careful about where we put our waste. Seems like common sense that you don't want to contaminate the land and water around where people live.

Going to keep my eyes open and see if I notice anything else that seems concerning. Might try talking to some of the other fellows, see what they think. But I'll have to be careful about it - don't want word getting back to Mr. Riley that I'm stirring up trouble about company practices.

For now, I'll keep doing my job and supporting my family. But I'm going to start paying closer attention to how we handle that waste. And maybe I'll do some more reading about industrial chemicals and their effects. Knowledge never hurt anybody, and if there is a problem, better to understand it sooner rather than later.

The smell from those waste barrels is still in my clothes even after I've been home for two hours. Mary always makes me change before dinner. Can't blame her - it's a harsh, chemical smell that seems to stick to everything. Makes me wonder what it's doing to the soil where we dump it, and what happens to that soil when the rains come.

Tomorrow's another day at the tannery. Another day of processing hides and handling chemicals and trying to balance doing right by my employer with doing right by my community. Not an easy balance to strike, but I suppose that's what being a man is about - making the hard choices and living with the consequences.
