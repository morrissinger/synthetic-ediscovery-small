# CRYOVAC INC. - MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT
## Equipment Cleaning Log - TCE Solvent Usage and Disposal

**Date:** March 16, 1967  
**Time:** 2:00 PM  
**Maintenance Crew Leader:** Robert "Bob" Kowalski  
**Shift:** Day Shift (7:00 AM - 3:00 PM)  
**Report To:** Frank Morrison, Maintenance Supervisor

---

### DAILY SOLVENT USAGE SUMMARY

**TCE (Trichloroethylene) Consumption:**
- Opening inventory: 285 gallons (Drum #TC-4401)
- Used for cleaning: 47 gallons
- Closing inventory: 238 gallons
- New drum received: Drum #TC-4402 (300 gallons)

**Equipment Cleaned Today:**
1. Packaging Line #3 - Conveyor belts and drive mechanisms
2. Heat sealing units (Units A-7, A-9, B-3)
3. Vacuum chamber cleaning - main production line
4. Degreasing of hydraulic components - Press #2
5. Parts washing station maintenance

### CLEANING OPERATIONS PERFORMED

**Morning Operations (7:30 AM - 11:45 AM):**
Started the day with routine cleaning of the packaging line conveyor systems. Used approximately 18 gallons of TCE for degreasing the belt mechanisms and drive chains. The solvent was applied using standard spray bottles and rags. After cleaning, the used TCE was collected in metal collection pans and transferred to the waste holding tank behind Building C.

Heat sealing units required extra attention today due to buildup of packaging material residue. Applied TCE liberally to dissolve the polymer deposits on the heating elements. Used about 12 gallons for this operation. The cleaning was thorough and effective - units are running at optimal temperature ranges again.

**Afternoon Operations (12:30 PM - 2:00 PM):**
Conducted deep cleaning of the main vacuum chamber which had developed some contamination issues affecting seal quality. This required flooding the chamber with TCE and allowing it to soak for 20 minutes before scrubbing. Used approximately 17 gallons for this procedure. The contaminated solvent was drained directly into the floor drains connected to our disposal system.

Press #2 hydraulic components were serviced using standard degreasing procedures. All hydraulic fittings and cylinders were cleaned with TCE to remove accumulated grease and metal shavings. This consumed about 8 gallons of solvent.

### DISPOSAL PROCEDURES

**Waste TCE Handling:**
All used solvent from today's operations was disposed of according to current company procedures. The contaminated TCE from equipment cleaning operations was:

1. Collected in metal pans and buckets during cleaning
2. Transferred to 55-gallon waste drums (Drums W-156, W-157)
3. Highly contaminated solvent poured directly into floor drains
4. Remaining residue wiped with rags, which were disposed of in regular trash

**Estimated Total Waste Generated:** 47 gallons
- 23 gallons to waste drums for potential reclamation
- 24 gallons disposed via floor drain system

The floor drain system connects to our disposal area behind the plant where it eventually reaches the groundwater system. This has been our standard practice since operations began and continues to be the most efficient method for handling contaminated solvents.

### EQUIPMENT STATUS REPORT

**Operational Status:**
- All cleaned equipment returned to service and operating within specifications
- No equipment damage or unusual wear noted
- TCE supply adequate for remainder of week
- Disposal capacity sufficient

**Maintenance Notes:**
The effectiveness of TCE as a cleaning solvent continues to be excellent for our operations. It dissolves all types of contamination we encounter and evaporates quickly, leaving equipment ready for immediate return to service. No alternative solvents have proven as effective for our cleaning requirements.

**Safety Observations:**
Crew members reported some dizziness during the vacuum chamber cleaning operation, likely due to vapor concentration in the confined space. Increased ventilation during future similar operations recommended. Otherwise, no safety incidents or concerns noted.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Inventory Management:** Current TCE consumption rate of 45-50 gallons per day requires weekly delivery of new drums. Recommend coordinating with purchasing to ensure consistent supply.

2. **Disposal Efficiency:** Current disposal methods are working effectively. The floor drain system provides immediate disposal capability without requiring temporary storage of contaminated solvents.

3. **Equipment Cleaning Schedule:** Suggest increasing frequency of conveyor belt cleaning to every other day rather than every third day to reduce TCE consumption per cleaning session.

4. **Cost Considerations:** TCE remains the most cost-effective cleaning solvent for our operations. At $0.85 per gallon, daily solvent costs are approximately $40, which is acceptable given the cleaning effectiveness.

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE NOTES

All solvent usage and disposal activities conducted in accordance with current company policies and applicable regulations. No special permits or notifications required for current disposal methods. Massachusetts industrial discharge regulations do not specifically address TCE disposal for manufacturing operations of our type.

**Next Scheduled Major Cleaning:** March 23, 1967  
**Estimated TCE Requirement:** 65-70 gallons  
**Special Equipment:** Production Line #1 complete breakdown cleaning
