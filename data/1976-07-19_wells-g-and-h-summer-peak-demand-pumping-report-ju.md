# Wells G and H Summer Peak Demand Pumping Report
## July 1976 Operational Analysis

**Prepared by:** Robert Chen, Water Systems Engineer  
**Date:** July 19, 1976  
**Report Period:** June 1 - July 15, 1976  
**Distribution:** Woburn Water Department Supervisor, Municipal Records

## Executive Summary

This report documents the operational performance of municipal Wells G and H during the peak summer demand period of June-July 1976. Both wells have maintained continuous operation to meet increased residential and commercial water consumption during the extended heat wave conditions experienced throughout eastern Massachusetts. Total combined output has averaged 1.8 million gallons per day, representing a 23% increase over the same period in 1975.

## Well G Performance Analysis

### Operational Parameters

Well G, commissioned in May 1964 and located on the Aberjona River floodplain approximately 600 feet northeast of the intersection of Salem Street and Montvale Avenue, has demonstrated consistent pumping capacity throughout the reporting period. The well reached a maximum daily output of 950,000 gallons on July 8, 1976, during the peak of the current heat wave when ambient temperatures exceeded 95°F for three consecutive days.

**Key Performance Metrics:**
- Average daily output: 875,000 gallons
- Peak hourly flow rate: 1,200 gallons per minute
- Operating pressure: 45-52 PSI
- Pump motor efficiency: 87%
- Downtime for maintenance: 2.3 hours total

### Water Quality Observations

Routine testing conducted on July 12, 1976, indicated compliance with current Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards for municipal water supplies. Chlorination levels have been maintained at 0.8-1.2 parts per million to ensure bacterial control during the high-demand period. Water temperature at the wellhead has averaged 52°F, providing cooling benefits during the current heat emergency.

Minor taste and odor complaints received from residents in the Montvale Road and Salem Street areas have been attributed to increased chlorination levels necessary during peak demand periods. These complaints represent less than 0.5% of households served by the G and H well system.

## Well H Performance Analysis

### Operational Parameters

Well H, commissioned in October 1966 and positioned approximately 400 feet south of Well G within the same aquifer system, has operated at near-maximum capacity throughout the reporting period. The well's proximity to residential areas along Pine Street and Montvale Road has required careful monitoring of drawdown effects on private wells in the immediate vicinity.

**Key Performance Metrics:**
- Average daily output: 925,000 gallons
- Peak hourly flow rate: 1,350 gallons per minute
- Operating pressure: 48-55 PSI
- Pump motor efficiency: 89%
- Downtime for maintenance: 1.8 hours total

### Aquifer Response

Groundwater level monitoring indicates a seasonal decline of 3.2 feet in the observation well located 200 feet southwest of Well H, consistent with typical summer drawdown patterns observed since 1968. Recovery rates during overnight low-demand periods suggest adequate aquifer recharge from the Aberjona River system and local precipitation.

Static water level measurements taken on July 15, 1976:
- Well G: 18.4 feet below ground surface
- Well H: 16.8 feet below ground surface
- Observation Well MW-1: 21.2 feet below ground surface

## System Integration and Distribution

The combined output from Wells G and H represents approximately 65% of Woburn's total municipal water supply during peak demand periods, with the remainder provided by the older wells serving the central and western portions of the city. The East Woburn distribution system, which receives the majority of G and H production, has maintained adequate pressure throughout the reporting period despite increased consumption.

Pressure monitoring stations located at:
- Corner of Montvale Road and Salem Street: 42-48 PSI
- Pine Street near Forest Street intersection: 38-44 PSI
- Washington Street near Mishawum Road: 45-51 PSI

## Chemical Analysis Summary

Water samples collected on July 5 and July 12, 1976, from both wells have been analyzed for standard parameters required under current regulations. Results indicate compliance with all applicable standards:

**Well G Sample Results (July 12, 1976):**
- pH: 6.8
- Total dissolved solids: 180 mg/L
- Chloride: 28 mg/L
- Iron: 0.15 mg/L
- Manganese: 0.08 mg/L
- Hardness (as CaCO3): 95 mg/L

**Well H Sample Results (July 12, 1976):**
- pH: 6.9
- Total dissolved solids: 195 mg/L
- Chloride: 32 mg/L
- Iron: 0.18 mg/L
- Manganese: 0.09 mg/L
- Hardness (as CaCO3): 102 mg/L

## Maintenance Activities

Routine maintenance performed during the reporting period included pump inspection, electrical system testing, and wellhead security verification. Both wells received scheduled lubrication service and motor bearing inspection on July 2, 1976. No significant mechanical issues were identified.

Chlorination equipment at both sites was recalibrated on June 15, 1976, to ensure proper disinfection levels during increased pumping rates. Backup chlorination systems were tested and confirmed operational.

## Recommendations

1. **Continued Monitoring**: Maintain current sampling schedule for water quality parameters, with particular attention to seasonal variations during peak demand periods.

2. **Infrastructure Assessment**: Schedule comprehensive pump and motor evaluation for both wells during the fall low-demand period to ensure continued reliable operation.

3. **Aquifer Protection**: Consider implementing wellhead protection zones around both installations to prevent potential contamination from surface activities.

4. **Emergency Preparedness**: Develop contingency plans for extended high-demand periods, including coordination with regional water authorities for supplemental supply if needed.

## Conclusion

Wells G and H have successfully met the increased water demand during the summer of 1976 while maintaining compliance with all applicable water quality standards. The aquifer system continues to demonstrate adequate capacity for sustained high-volume pumping, though continued monitoring of groundwater levels remains essential for long-term resource management.

Both installations are operating within design parameters and providing essential water supply services to the East Woburn residential and commercial areas. Regular maintenance schedules and quality monitoring protocols have ensured reliable operation throughout the peak demand period.
