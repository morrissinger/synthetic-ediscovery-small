**City of Woburn Water Department**  
**Municipal Water Testing Division**

---

## SAMPLE IDENTIFICATION

**Sample ID:** WG-08251965-001  
**Well Designation:** Well G (East Woburn Municipal Supply)  
**Collection Date:** August 25, 1965  
**Collection Time:** 16:00 Hours  
**Collected By:** Robert M. Sullivan, Municipal Water Technician  
**Weather Conditions:** Clear, 78°F, Light SW Wind  

---

## WELL INFORMATION

**Location:** East Woburn, approximately 500 feet east of Aberjona River  
**Well Depth:** 88 feet  
**Pump Depth:** 75 feet  
**Static Water Level:** 12 feet below ground surface  
**Pumping Rate at Time of Collection:** 450 gallons per minute  
**Hours of Operation Prior to Sampling:** 6 hours continuous  

---

## SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

### Pre-Sampling Procedures
1. Well pump operated continuously for minimum 6 hours prior to sample collection to ensure representative groundwater sample
2. Sampling tap thoroughly cleaned with 10% bleach solution and rinsed with distilled water
3. Tap allowed to run for 5 minutes prior to sample collection to clear any standing water from distribution lines
4. All sampling equipment sterilized according to Department procedures

### Sample Collection Protocol
- **Primary Sample:** 1-liter amber glass bottle for chemical analysis
- **Secondary Sample:** 500ml clear glass bottle for bacteriological testing  
- **Preservation:** Samples maintained at 4°C in ice chest during transport
- **Chain of Custody:** Samples sealed and labeled immediately upon collection

### Field Observations
- **Water Appearance:** Clear, no visible turbidity or discoloration
- **Odor:** None detected at wellhead
- **Taste:** Not tested per Department protocol
- **pH (Field Test):** 6.8 using portable pH meter
- **Temperature:** 52°F at wellhead discharge

---

## SAMPLING CONDITIONS

### Well Performance Data
- **Current Flow Rate:** 450 GPM (within normal operating parameters)
- **Pump Motor:** Operating normally, no unusual vibration or noise
- **Wellhead Condition:** Secure, no visible damage to casing or cap
- **Surrounding Area:** No obvious sources of surface contamination observed

### Recent Operational History
- Well G has been in continuous operation for past 72 hours due to increased summer demand
- Last maintenance performed: July 15, 1965 (routine pump inspection)
- No reported taste or odor complaints from East Woburn residents in past 30 days
- Distribution system pressure maintained at 45-50 PSI throughout service area

---

## QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES

### Equipment Calibration
- pH meter calibrated using standard buffer solutions (pH 4.0, 7.0, 10.0)
- Thermometer verified against NIST traceable standard
- All glassware cleaned with laboratory-grade detergent and rinsed with distilled water

### Documentation
- Sample collection logged in Department field book #47, pages 156-157
- Photographs taken of wellhead and immediate surrounding area
- Weather and operational conditions recorded per standard procedure

---

## SAMPLE TRANSPORT AND DELIVERY

**Transport Method:** Department vehicle #12  
**Delivery Time:** 17:30 Hours same day  
**Delivered To:** Woburn Water Department Laboratory, 10 Common Street  
**Received By:** Margaret F. Thompson, Laboratory Supervisor  
**Sample Condition Upon Delivery:** Intact seals, proper temperature maintained

---

## RECOMMENDED ANALYSIS

Based on routine monitoring schedule and current Department protocols, request the following analyses be performed:

### Standard Municipal Water Quality Panel
- **Bacteriological:** Total coliform count, E. coli presence/absence
- **Chemical Parameters:** Chloride, sulfate, nitrate, total dissolved solids
- **Physical Properties:** Turbidity, color, pH confirmation
- **Metals:** Iron, manganese, copper, lead

### Additional Testing (If Warranted)
- Volatile organic compounds analysis if any unusual odors detected during processing
- Heavy metals panel if indicated by preliminary screening results

---

## TECHNICIAN NOTES

Well G continues to operate within normal parameters established since opening in 1964. No unusual conditions observed during this sampling event. Water production remains consistent with seasonal demand patterns. Recommend continued monthly sampling as per Department schedule.

Recent industrial activity in the Aberjona River watershed has been noted in Department files. While no specific contamination concerns have been identified, continued monitoring of this well is prudent given its proximity to manufacturing facilities upstream.

Next scheduled sampling: September 25, 1965
