### Pain Assessment

Patient reports generalized body aches, rating pain as 4/10 on pediatric pain scale. Describes pain as "feeling sore all over like I have the flu." Denies severe or localized pain. Acetaminophen 240mg given at 10:00 for comfort. Patient appears to have good pain tolerance but shows signs of emotional distress related to prolonged hospitalization and treatment effects.

### Psychosocial Observations

Carl has been increasingly withdrawn since admission. Reports missing school and friends. Expressed concern about his appearance, particularly hair loss. States "I don't want the other kids to see me like this." Parents visit daily and are very supportive. Mother stays overnight most evenings. Social worker consulted for ongoing emotional support.

Patient asked multiple questions about "why this happened to me" and whether other children in his neighborhood are also sick. Parents report that Carl has mentioned knowing several other children from East Woburn who have been diagnosed with similar illnesses. This appears to be causing additional anxiety for both patient and family.

### Treatment Response Assessment

Patient is tolerating current chemotherapy regimen with expected side effects. Cytarabine and 6-mercaptopurine administered as scheduled. Anti-emetic regimen includes prochlorperazine 2.5mg PO q6h PRN nausea and metoclopramide 5mg PO q8h.

**RESPONSE TO TREATMENT:**
- Blast count in peripheral blood: <1% (excellent response)
- Bone marrow aspirate scheduled for August 7, 1979
- CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal methotrexate completed without complications

### Nursing Interventions

3. **Emotional Support:** Nursing staff spending additional time with patient for therapeutic communication. Child life specialist visits daily for age-appropriate activities and emotional support.

### Provider Notes

Carl continues to demonstrate remarkable courage despite the significant physical and emotional challenges of his treatment. His parents are extremely dedicated and well-informed about his care. The family has expressed concerns about environmental factors that may have contributed to Carl's illness, particularly given reports of other childhood leukemia cases in their East Woburn neighborhood.

Dr. Morrison has discussed with the family the importance of focusing on Carl's treatment while acknowledging their concerns about potential environmental causes. Social worker will continue to provide support and resources as the family processes these complex issues.

**NEXT ASSESSMENT:** Evening shift nursing assessment at 20:00
