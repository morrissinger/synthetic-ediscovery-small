# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Site Manager, Beatrice Foods Company  
**FROM:** J. Morrison, Foreman, John J. Riley Company  
**DATE:** October 23, 1972  
**RE:** Waste Storage Area Expansion at Undeveloped Parcel

## Current Storage Capacity Issues

Our waste storage operations at the undeveloped parcel adjacent to your facility have reached maximum capacity as of this week. The current staging area, approximately 2.5 acres in size, is no longer adequate for the volume of industrial waste materials being generated by your tanning operations. We are experiencing significant backup in our collection and disposal schedule, which is affecting our ability to maintain regular pickup services as outlined in our service agreement dated March 15, 1971.

The primary storage area currently contains approximately 150 drums of various chemical waste products, including spent chromium solutions, degreasing solvents, and other tanning process byproducts. Additional materials are being temporarily stored in the secondary staging area, but this arrangement is not sustainable for long-term operations. Weather conditions over the past month have created additional challenges, with several drum containers showing signs of deterioration and potential leakage into the surrounding soil.

## Proposed Expansion Plan

Riley Company proposes to expand the waste storage area by an additional 1.8 acres to the northeast section of the undeveloped parcel. This expansion would allow for proper segregation of different waste types and provide adequate spacing between storage areas to facilitate truck access and material handling. The expanded area would accommodate up to 300 additional drums and provide improved drainage to prevent accumulation of surface water around storage containers.

Our crew has already begun preliminary site preparation by clearing vegetation and grading the proposed expansion area. We estimate that the expanded storage facility will be operational within two weeks, pending your approval and any necessary permits from the city. The expanded capacity should meet your facility's waste disposal needs for at least the next eighteen months, based on current production levels.

## Operational Considerations

The expanded storage area will require installation of additional gravel surfacing to provide stable footing for our collection vehicles. We also recommend installation of temporary fencing around the perimeter to restrict access and prevent unauthorized dumping by other parties. Current security measures consisting of periodic site checks by our personnel will continue, with increased frequency during peak storage periods.

We have coordinated with our disposal contractor to ensure that pickup schedules can accommodate the increased volume once the expansion is complete. Regular removal of stored materials will continue on a monthly basis, or more frequently as needed to maintain adequate storage capacity. All disposal activities will continue to follow established procedures for handling industrial waste materials.

Please contact our office at MAyfair 4-7829 to discuss approval of this expansion plan. We are prepared to begin full operations in the expanded area by November 6, 1972, contingent upon your authorization to proceed.
