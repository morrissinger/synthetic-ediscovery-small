# synthetic-ediscovery-small
Synthetic e-discovery data set based on Anderson v. Cryovac, 805 F.2d 1 (1986)

Although this data set ultimately begins with the actual legal complaint in Anderson, that's where the connection with real events ends. Thus any similarity between people, places, and events in this data set and in reality are purely coincidental.
