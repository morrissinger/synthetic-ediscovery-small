Synthetic e-discovery data set based on Anderson v. Cryovac, 805 F.2d 1 (1986)

Although this data set ultimately begins with the actual [legal complaint in Anderson](https://www.ericejohnson.com/extstor/c/Anderson_v_Cryovac_Beatrice_trial_plan.pdf), that's where the connection with real events ends. Thus any similarity between people, places, and events in this data set and in reality are purely coincidental.
