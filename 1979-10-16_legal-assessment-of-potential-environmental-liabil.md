**RE: Legal Assessment of Potential Environmental Liability Exposure - East Woburn Operations**

Dear Mr. Harrison:

Following our telephone conference of October 12, 1979, and pursuant to your request for immediate legal assessment regarding the recent closure of municipal Wells G and H in East Woburn, I am providing this preliminary analysis of W.R. Grace Company's potential liability exposure arising from alleged groundwater contamination in the Aberjona River Valley area.

## Background and Current Situation

As you are aware, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health ordered the closure of Wells G and H on May 22, 1979, following detection of volatile organic compounds including trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) at levels exceeding acceptable standards for potable water. These wells, which have served the eastern Woburn community since 1964 and 1966 respectively, are located hydraulically downgradient from your Cryovac manufacturing facility at 369 Washington Street.

The timing of this closure coincides with increasing public attention to a reported cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn neighborhoods served by these wells. While no direct causal relationship has been established between the water contamination and health effects, the proximity of these events creates a significant legal and public relations concern for all industrial operations in the affected area.

## Potential Legal Theories of Liability

Based on my review of applicable Massachusetts law and similar environmental contamination cases, W.R. Grace Company faces potential exposure under several legal theories:

### 1. Negligence Claims

Under Massachusetts common law, industrial operators owe a duty of reasonable care in the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances. Potential plaintiffs may argue that W.R. Grace breached this duty through:

- Improper storage of industrial solvents including trichloroethylene
- Inadequate containment systems for chemical waste materials
- Failure to monitor groundwater conditions adjacent to disposal areas
- Disposal practices that failed to meet industry standards for environmental protection

The company's use of TCE and other chlorinated solvents in manufacturing operations, combined with the documented presence of these same chemicals in the contaminated wells, establishes a factual nexus that plaintiffs' counsel will likely exploit. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that foreseeability of harm is a critical element in negligence actions, and the known toxicity of industrial solvents supports arguments that groundwater contamination was a foreseeable consequence of improper disposal practices.

### 2. Private Nuisance

Massachusetts recognizes both intentional and unintentional private nuisance claims for interference with the use and enjoyment of property. The contamination of domestic water supplies serving residential neighborhoods constitutes a substantial interference with fundamental property rights. Even if W.R. Grace's disposal practices were unintentional, the company may face liability under an unintentional nuisance theory if the contamination resulted from conduct that was negligent, reckless, or abnormally dangerous.

The duration of Wells G and H operation (fifteen years) and the extent of community reliance on these water sources strengthen potential nuisance claims. Massachusetts courts have held that the severity and duration of interference are critical factors in nuisance determinations, and contamination of a municipal water supply affecting hundreds of families clearly meets the threshold for substantial interference.

### 3. Strict Liability for Abnormally Dangerous Activities

While Massachusetts has not definitively adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts approach to abnormally dangerous activities, recent decisions suggest increasing judicial receptivity to strict liability theories in environmental contamination cases. The industrial use and disposal of toxic solvents may qualify as abnormally dangerous activity, particularly given:

- The high degree of risk posed by chlorinated solvents to human health
- The likelihood of serious harm from improper disposal
- The inability to eliminate risk through reasonable care
- The inappropriateness of the activity in relation to residential areas

## Factual Vulnerabilities and Defensive Strategies

### Company Records and Documentation

I recommend immediate preservation of all documents related to:
- Chemical purchasing records for TCE and other solvents (1964-present)
- Waste disposal contracts and manifests
- Environmental monitoring reports or studies
- Correspondence with regulatory agencies
- Internal communications regarding waste management practices

Any document destruction at this time would create serious litigation risks and potential sanctions.

### Industrial Practices Assessment

Our preliminary investigation suggests that W.R. Grace's disposal practices during the 1960s and early 1970s were consistent with industry standards of that period. However, evolving environmental awareness and regulatory requirements may limit the effectiveness of industry custom as a defense. Massachusetts courts increasingly scrutinize whether industry practices adequately protect public health and environmental resources.

The location of your facility within the Aberjona River Valley trench presents both risks and opportunities. While the geological characteristics of this area may have contributed to rapid contaminant migration toward the wells, the same features affect all industrial operations in the valley, potentially supporting arguments for shared responsibility among multiple defendants.

### Multiple Potentially Responsible Parties

The presence of other industrial operations in the area, including the Beatrice Foods tannery operation and associated properties, creates opportunities for apportionment of liability. Massachusetts follows joint and several liability principles in environmental cases, but recent legislative developments suggest increasing judicial attention to equitable allocation of damages among multiple tortfeasors.

Beatrice Foods' ownership of both active tanning operations and undeveloped land adjacent to the wells may present significant liability exposure for that entity. Historical land use records indicate potential disposal activities on Beatrice properties that predate your company's operations in the area.

## Immediate Recommendations

1. **Document Preservation**: Implement immediate litigation hold procedures for all documents related to chemical use, waste disposal, and environmental matters dating to 1964.

2. **Environmental Assessment**: Engage qualified environmental consultants to conduct comprehensive groundwater and soil contamination assessment of your property. This investigation should focus on defining the extent of any contamination and establishing timing of releases.

3. **Insurance Coverage Review**: Examine all general liability and environmental insurance policies for potential coverage of investigation costs and liability exposure. Early notification to carriers is essential to preserve coverage rights.

4. **Regulatory Coordination**: Maintain cooperative stance with EPA and Massachusetts environmental authorities while preserving legal rights. Voluntary cleanup efforts may limit future liability exposure but should not proceed without careful legal review.

5. **Community Relations**: Avoid public statements regarding responsibility or causation pending completion of environmental assessment and development of comprehensive legal strategy.

## Conclusion

While W.R. Grace Company faces potentially significant liability exposure arising from the East Woburn groundwater contamination, several factors support vigorous defense of any claims. The presence of multiple industrial operations in the affected area, the consistency of historical disposal practices with industry standards, and the absence of established causation between water contamination and reported health effects provide substantial grounds for challenging plaintiff claims.

However, the combination of documented chemical contamination, public health concerns, and evolving environmental liability law creates a serious litigation risk that requires immediate and comprehensive response. I recommend scheduling a meeting within the next week to discuss detailed litigation strategy and coordinate with your environmental consultants and insurance counsel.

Please contact my office at (617) 555-4200 to arrange this meeting at your earliest convenience. Time is critical in developing an effective response to this emerging situation.

Very truly yours,
