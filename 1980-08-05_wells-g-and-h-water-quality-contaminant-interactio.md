## Abstract

This technical report presents findings from a comprehensive water quality assessment of municipal Wells G and H in East Woburn, Massachusetts, conducted between May 1979 and July 1980. The investigation was initiated following routine volatile organic compound testing that revealed significant contamination levels in both wells. Laboratory analysis identified trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and 1,1,1-trichloroethane as primary contaminants at concentrations substantially exceeding safe drinking water standards. Hydrogeological analysis indicates contamination sources consistent with industrial solvent disposal practices at multiple facilities within the Aberjona River Valley watershed. The study documents a clear pattern of groundwater contamination that compromised municipal water supply quality for residential consumers served by these wells from 1964-1979.

## Introduction

Wells G and H commenced operations in 1964 and 1966 respectively as supplemental water sources for the City of Woburn's municipal water system. Located in the eastern section of the city within the Aberjona River Valley geological formation, these wells drew from a previously untapped aquifer system approximately 60 feet below surface grade. Combined daily capacity reached 3.2 million gallons, providing approximately 35% of municipal water supply to residential areas in eastern Woburn during peak operational periods.

The wells were constructed according to Massachusetts Department of Public Health specifications for municipal water sources, with steel casing extending through unconsolidated glacial deposits into underlying bedrock formations. Well G, the northern installation, reached a total depth of 180 feet with a 12-inch diameter casing. Well H, positioned approximately 400 yards southeast, extended to 165 feet depth with identical casing specifications.

Routine water quality monitoring conducted in May 1979 under Massachusetts Safe Drinking Water Act requirements revealed volatile organic compound concentrations requiring immediate investigation. This report documents comprehensive analytical findings and hydrogeological assessment conducted over the subsequent 14-month period.

## Methodology

### Sample Collection Protocol

Water samples were collected monthly from both wells using EPA-approved sampling procedures for volatile organic analysis. Collection points included wellhead taps prior to chlorination treatment and distribution system entry points. Chain-of-custody procedures maintained sample integrity during transport to EPA Region I laboratory facilities in Lexington, Massachusetts.

### Analytical Procedures

Volatile organic compound analysis utilized purge-and-trap gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) according to EPA Method 502.1. Detection limits ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 parts per billion depending on specific compounds. Quality assurance included duplicate analysis of 15% of samples and certified reference standard verification.

### Hydrogeological Investigation

Subsurface investigation included installation of 12 monitoring wells positioned in a radial pattern around Wells G and H. Monitoring points extended from 25 feet to 200 feet depth to characterize contaminant distribution within the aquifer system. Groundwater flow direction and velocity were determined through water level measurements and tracer studies conducted between September 1979 and March 1980.

## Findings

### Contaminant Concentrations

Laboratory analysis documented consistent detection of chlorinated organic solvents in both municipal wells throughout the operational period. Primary contaminants identified include:

**Trichloroethylene (TCE):**
- Well G: 267 parts per billion average concentration
- Well H: 183 parts per billion average concentration
- EPA Maximum Contaminant Level: 5 parts per billion

**Tetrachloroethylene (PCE):**
- Well G: 21 parts per billion average concentration
- Well H: 34 parts per billion average concentration
- EPA Maximum Contaminant Level: 5 parts per billion

**1,1,1-Trichloroethane:**
- Well G: 56 parts per billion average concentration
- Well H: 42 parts per billion average concentration
- EPA Maximum Contaminant Level: 200 parts per billion

Additional compounds detected at lower concentrations included dichloroethylene isomers, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. Total volatile organic compound concentrations averaged 344 parts per billion in Well G and 259 parts per billion in Well H.

### Hydrogeological Assessment

Groundwater flow analysis indicates predominant southwest-to-northeast flow direction within the shallow aquifer system at an average velocity of 0.8 feet per day. Monitoring well data reveals two distinct contaminant plume configurations:

**Northern Plume:** Originating from industrial facilities northeast of Wells G and H, this contamination source shows highest TCE concentrations and extends approximately 2,800 feet in the direction of groundwater flow. Maximum contaminant concentrations occur at depths between 45-75 feet below surface, consistent with well screen elevations.

**Southern Plume:** A secondary contamination source located southwest of the wells exhibits elevated PCE concentrations with a narrower distribution pattern. This plume extends approximately 1,200 feet downgradient with peak concentrations at depths of 35-60 feet.

### Temporal Distribution Analysis

Historical water quality data reconstruction based on distribution system records and consumer complaints indicates contamination presence throughout the operational period of Wells G and H. Organic solvent odors reported by residents as early as 1968 correlate with analytical findings of volatile organic compounds in treated water samples.

Monthly sampling data from May 1979 through July 1980 demonstrates relatively stable contaminant concentrations, suggesting continuous source loading rather than episodic contamination events. Seasonal variations show slight increases during spring months, consistent with enhanced groundwater recharge and contaminant mobilization.

## Source Identification

Industrial facility investigation identified multiple potential contamination sources within the watershed area:

### W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac Inc. Facility
Located at 369 Washington Street, approximately 1,500 feet northeast of Well G, this manufacturing operation utilized trichloroethylene and other chlorinated solvents in packaging machinery production processes. Site inspection revealed:
- Documented use of TCE as degreasing solvent from 1960-1978
- On-site waste disposal practices including drum storage and surface application
- Soil contamination consistent with historical solvent disposal
- Groundwater contamination plume alignment with Wells G and H

### Beatrice Foods/Riley Tannery Complex
The John J. Riley Company tannery at 228 Salem Street, operated under Beatrice Foods ownership, utilized tetrachloroethylene and related solvents in leather processing operations. Investigation findings include:
- PCE usage in degreasing and cleaning operations from 1965-1979
- Waste lagoon system receiving process wastewater
- Adjacent undeveloped property showing soil contamination indicators
- Hydrogeological connection to southern contamination plume

## Health Implications

Water quality degradation documented in this study represents a significant public health concern for residents served by Wells G and H during the 1964-1979 operational period. Chronic exposure to chlorinated organic solvents through drinking water consumption has been associated with various adverse health effects in epidemiological studies.

Trichloroethylene exposure at concentrations documented in Wells G and H exceeds EPA health advisory levels by factors of 30-50, indicating potential for systemic health impacts among exposed populations. Particular concern exists for vulnerable populations including pregnant women, infants, and children who may experience enhanced susceptibility to chemical toxicity.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has initiated a comprehensive health assessment of residents in areas served by these wells, with preliminary findings indicating elevated rates of childhood leukemia and other hematological disorders in the affected population.

## Conclusions

This investigation conclusively demonstrates that municipal Wells G and H supplied contaminated water to East Woburn residents for approximately 15 years due to industrial groundwater contamination. The contamination pattern indicates multiple source contributions, with primary responsibility attributable to industrial solvent disposal practices at facilities within the watershed area.

Contaminant concentrations documented in this study substantially exceed federal drinking water standards and pose significant health risks to exposed populations. The temporal persistence and spatial distribution of contamination indicate systematic environmental contamination resulting from industrial waste disposal practices that violated accepted standards
