# W.R. GRACE COMPANY
## CHEMICAL INVENTORY STATUS REPORT
### Production Solvents Division

**TO:** Production Manager  
**FROM:** Grace Plant Chemist  
**DATE:** August 30, 1966  
**RE:** Monthly Chemical Inventory Status - Production Solvents

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides the monthly inventory status for production solvents utilized in our manufacturing operations as of August 30, 1966. Current inventory levels remain adequate to support projected production schedules through the end of September, with several critical observations regarding storage capacity and disposal requirements detailed below.

## Current Inventory Status

### Primary Production Solvents

**Trichloroethylene (TCE)**
- Current Stock: 12,400 gallons
- Monthly Consumption Rate: 3,200 gallons
- Storage Location: Tank Farm Area B, Tanks 7-12
- Supplier: Allied Chemical Corporation
- Next Delivery Scheduled: September 15, 1966 (8,000 gallons)

**Perchloroethylene (PCE)**
- Current Stock: 8,750 gallons
- Monthly Consumption Rate: 2,800 gallons
- Storage Location: Tank Farm Area B, Tanks 13-16
- Supplier: Dow Chemical Company
- Next Delivery Scheduled: September 8, 1966 (6,000 gallons)

**Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK)**
- Current Stock: 6,200 gallons
- Monthly Consumption Rate: 1,900 gallons
- Storage Location: Building 15, Secondary Containment Area
- Supplier: Eastman Chemical Company
- Next Delivery Scheduled: September 22, 1966 (4,000 gallons)

### Secondary Solvents and Cleaning Agents

**Acetone**
- Current Stock: 3,100 gallons
- Monthly Consumption Rate: 950 gallons
- Storage Location: Building 15, Flammable Storage Wing

**Isopropyl Alcohol**
- Current Stock: 1,850 gallons
- Monthly Consumption Rate: 600 gallons
- Storage Location: Building 15, General Storage Area

**Benzene**
- Current Stock: 2,400 gallons
- Monthly Consumption Rate: 750 gallons
- Storage Location: Tank Farm Area C, Tank 3
- **Note:** Requires enhanced ventilation protocols per recent safety bulletin

## Storage Capacity Analysis

Current storage utilization stands at approximately 78% of total capacity across all solvent storage areas. Tank Farm Area B has reached 85% capacity, necessitating consideration of expanded storage infrastructure or modified delivery scheduling to prevent operational disruptions. The recent increase in production volume for the Cryovac division has resulted in higher than anticipated solvent consumption rates, particularly for TCE and PCE.

## Waste Solvent Accumulation

### Current Waste Inventory

**Spent Trichloroethylene**
- Volume: 2,800 gallons
- Storage: Waste holding tanks 1-3, Area D
- Contamination Level: Mixed with cutting oils and metal particles
- Disposal Status: Awaiting pickup by contracted disposal service

**Spent Perchloroethylene**
- Volume: 1,950 gallons
- Storage: Waste holding tanks 4-5, Area D
- Contamination Level: Mixed with polymer residues
- Disposal Status: Scheduled for disposal September 5, 1966

**Mixed Solvent Waste**
- Volume: 1,200 gallons
- Storage: Waste holding tank 6, Area D
- Composition: Various solvents mixed with process water
- Disposal Status: Requires analysis before disposal determination

## Operational Considerations

The manufacturing schedule for September indicates a 15% increase in solvent requirements due to expanded Cryovac production lines. This increase will necessitate adjustment of delivery schedules and may require temporary storage solutions if current infrastructure proves insufficient. Additionally, the recent installation of new degreasing equipment in Building 12 has resulted in higher TCE consumption rates than initially projected.

Quality control testing of incoming solvent deliveries continues to meet specifications, with no significant deviations noted in the past month. However, storage tank inspections scheduled for October may require temporary relocation of inventory, which should be factored into procurement planning.

## Recommendations

1. **Expand Storage Capacity:** Consider installation of additional storage tanks in Tank Farm Area B to accommodate increased solvent requirements and provide operational flexibility.

2. **Optimize Delivery Scheduling:** Coordinate with suppliers to implement more frequent, smaller deliveries to maintain adequate inventory levels without exceeding storage capacity.

3. **Enhance Waste Management:** Expedite disposal of accumulated waste solvents to free storage capacity and maintain compliance with internal waste management protocols.

4. **Monitor Consumption Patterns:** Implement weekly consumption tracking for TCE and PCE to better predict inventory requirements and prevent supply disruptions.

5. **Storage Infrastructure Assessment:** Conduct comprehensive evaluation of all storage tanks and associated piping systems to ensure continued operational integrity and compliance with safety standards.

The current inventory position supports continued operations through the remainder of the third quarter, provided that recommended delivery schedules are maintained and no significant disruptions occur in the supply chain. Close monitoring of consumption rates will be essential as production volumes continue to increase in response to market demand.
