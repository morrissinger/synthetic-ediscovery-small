### CLINICAL NOTES

This 12-year-old male continues on intensive chemotherapy for ALL diagnosed in June 1979. He is one of several pediatric leukemia cases from the East Woburn area currently under our care. Patient and family demonstrate good understanding of treatment plan and compliance with medical recommendations. 

Carl continues to experience significant conscious pain and suffering related to his diagnosis and treatment. He has verbalized fears about his illness and asks frequent questions about his prognosis. The family reports he has nightmares and has become withdrawn from normal childhood activities. Physical discomfort includes persistent fatigue, nausea, mouth sores, and generalized weakness. Pain management includes both pharmacological interventions and psychological support services.

The patient's response to treatment remains within expected parameters for his protocol. Continued monitoring of blood counts and organ function will be essential. Family support services and pediatric psychology consultation continue to be important components of his comprehensive care plan.

**Complications This Cycle:**
- Grade 2 mucositis (mouth sores)
- Grade 1 neuropathy (fingertip numbness)
- Persistent fatigue and weakness
- Decreased oral intake requiring nutritional counseling

**Plan:**
- Continue current protocol as scheduled
- Monitor CBC with differential weekly
- Nutritional assessment with dietitian
- Continue psychological support services
- Next chemotherapy cycle scheduled August 24, 1979
