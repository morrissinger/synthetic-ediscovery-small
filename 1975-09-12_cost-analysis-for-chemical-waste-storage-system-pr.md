# INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Operations Director  
**FROM:** Robert M. Henderson, Facility Manager  
**DATE:** September 12, 1975  
**RE:** Cost Analysis for Chemical Waste Storage System Proposal

This memo provides a preliminary cost analysis for the proposed chemical waste storage system upgrade at our Woburn facility, as requested in your August 28th directive. The analysis considers both capital expenditure requirements and ongoing operational costs associated with improved containment protocols for our manufacturing waste streams.

## Current Waste Management Assessment

Our existing waste disposal methods at the Woburn plant currently handle approximately 2,400 gallons of chemical waste monthly, primarily consisting of trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and various organic solvents used in our Cryovac manufacturing processes. The current system utilizes surface disposal areas located on the eastern portion of our 15-acre property, adjacent to the Aberjona River watershed. While this method has proven cost-effective, recent discussions with plant engineering staff suggest potential benefits from enhanced containment systems.

The proposed upgrade would involve construction of lined storage pits with improved drainage systems, estimated at $47,000 for initial construction plus $8,200 annually for maintenance and monitoring. Additional costs would include installation of groundwater monitoring wells at $3,500 per well (minimum four wells recommended) and quarterly testing protocols estimated at $1,200 per year. Total first-year implementation costs would reach approximately $69,100, with ongoing annual expenses of $9,400.

## Operational Considerations

Implementation of enhanced storage systems would require temporary shutdown of disposal operations for approximately six weeks during construction, resulting in estimated production delays valued at $12,000. Alternative temporary disposal arrangements through licensed contractors would cost an additional $8,500 during the construction period. Plant personnel would require training on new protocols, estimated at 40 hours of supervisory time valued at $800.

The current disposal methods have operated without significant incident since plant operations began in 1960, and our manufacturing processes continue to meet all applicable federal and state regulations. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering has not issued any compliance directives requiring modifications to our current waste management practices. Local municipal authorities have similarly not raised concerns regarding our operations or their potential impact on area water supplies.

## Recommendation

Based on this preliminary analysis, the proposed chemical waste storage system upgrade represents a significant capital investment without clear regulatory necessity or demonstrated operational benefits. The $69,100 first-year cost, combined with ongoing annual expenses of $9,400, would impact our facility's cost-effectiveness without corresponding improvements to production efficiency or regulatory compliance status.

I recommend maintaining our current waste management protocols while continuing to monitor regulatory developments that might necessitate future modifications. Should you require additional analysis or wish to discuss alternative approaches to waste management optimization, please contact me at extension 247.
