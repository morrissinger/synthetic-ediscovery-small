**Location:** Conference Room B, Schrafft Center, 150 Tremont Street, Boston, MA  
**Meeting Chair:** Dr. Bailus Walker Jr., Secretary of Health and Human Services  

### ATTENDEES

**Present:**
- Dr. Bailus Walker Jr., Secretary of Health and Human Services

- Janet Filiault, Chief, Environmental Health Section

**Absent:**

### AGENDA ITEM 1: WOBURN LEUKEMIA CLUSTER INVESTIGATION STATUS

Dr. Cobb opened the discussion by reviewing the current status of the Woburn childhood leukemia investigation. As of May 1, 1981, the Department has documented eight cases of childhood leukemia in the East Woburn area, with the most recent fatality being James Anderson on January 18, 1981. The affected children include:

- James Anderson (deceased January 18, 1981, age 12)
- Kevin Kane Jr. (diagnosed 1973, age 2)
- Michael Zona (diagnosed 1974, age 6)
- Patrick Toomey (diagnosed 1976, age 4)
- Carl Robbins III (diagnosed 1977, age 5)
- Roland Gamache (diagnosed 1979, age 7)
- Two additional cases currently under review

Dr. Cobb emphasized that the cluster represents a statistically significant elevation above expected rates for the population size and geographic area. The cases are concentrated in neighborhoods served by municipal Wells G and H, which were opened in 1964 and 1966 respectively.

**Action Item:** Dr. Cutler to complete epidemiological analysis by May 15, 1981.

### AGENDA ITEM 2: WATER QUALITY TESTING RESULTS

Janet Filiault presented preliminary findings from the expanded water testing program initiated in March 1981. Wells G and H have shown consistent contamination with industrial solvents, specifically:

- Trichloroethylene (TCE) concentrations ranging from 180 to 400 parts per billion
- Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) concentrations at approximately 43 parts per billion
- Additional volatile organic compounds detected at lower concentrations

These levels significantly exceed federal guidelines for safe drinking water. The contamination appears to have been present since the wells became operational, based on sediment core analysis and historical water quality records.

Dr. Walker expressed serious concern about the duration of exposure and questioned why earlier testing had not detected these contaminants. Filiault explained that routine testing protocols in the 1960s and 1970s did not include screening for industrial solvents, as these were not recognized as priority contaminants in municipal water supplies.

**Action Item:** Filiault to coordinate with EPA Region I for comprehensive groundwater mapping by June 1, 1981.

### AGENDA ITEM 3: POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION SOURCES

The meeting reviewed preliminary findings regarding potential sources of groundwater contamination in the Aberjona River watershed. Industrial facilities of concern include:

**W.R. Grace Company (Beatrice Chemicals Division):**
- Located at 1 Grace Road, approximately 1,500 feet from Wells G and H
- Historical operations involving trichloroethylene and other chlorinated solvents
- Documented disposal practices on company property

**Cryovac Inc. (W.R. Grace subsidiary):**
- Manufacturing facility producing food packaging materials
- Confirmed use of TCE and PCE in production processes
- Waste disposal practices under investigation

**John J. Riley Company:**
- Hide processing and tanning operations
- Chemical usage patterns consistent with detected contaminants
- Site inspection scheduled for May 12, 1981

Dr. Ozonoff noted that the hydrogeological characteristics of the area suggest contamination could have migrated through groundwater over several years before reaching the municipal wells. The timing of well activation and the onset of leukemia cases shows a concerning correlation that warrants immediate action.

**Action Item:** Legal Counsel Murphy to review potential enforcement actions against identified facilities.

### AGENDA ITEM 4: PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE

Dr. Walker outlined the immediate public health measures being implemented:

1. **Well Closure:** Wells G and H were permanently closed on May 22, 1979, following initial contamination detection
2. **Alternative Water Supply:** Affected neighborhoods now receive water from uncontaminated sources
3. **Medical Surveillance:** Ongoing monitoring of residents, particularly children, in the affected area
4. **Community Notification:** Public meetings scheduled for May 14 and May 21, 1981

The Department faces significant challenges in communicating risk to the community while the investigation continues. Dr. Lagakos emphasized the importance of maintaining scientific rigor while addressing legitimate public concerns about ongoing health risks.

Patricia Murphy raised concerns about potential legal liability given the documented exposure period and health outcomes. She recommended coordination with the Attorney General's office regarding possible legal action against responsible parties.

**Action Item:** Dr. Mullan to draft public health advisory for affected residents by May 8, 1981.

### AGENDA ITEM 5: COORDINATION WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES

The Environmental Protection Agency has initiated parallel investigations under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). EPA Region I Administrator is expected to designate the area as a priority cleanup site.

Federal involvement provides additional technical resources but also requires careful coordination to avoid conflicting public messages. The Department will maintain primary responsibility for public health assessment while EPA leads environmental remediation efforts.

Dr. Walker stressed the importance of maintaining state authority over health-related decisions while leveraging federal resources for technical support.

**Action Item:** Dr. Walker to meet with EPA Regional Administrator by May 12, 1981.

### AGENDA ITEM 6: RESOURCE ALLOCATION

The investigation requires significant additional resources beyond current departmental capacity. Immediate needs include:

- Additional epidemiological staff for expanded case investigation
- Laboratory capacity for ongoing water and environmental testing
- Legal support for potential enforcement actions
- Community relations specialists for public communication

Dr. Walker indicated he would request emergency funding from the Governor's office to support the investigation. The estimated cost for the remainder of fiscal year 1981 is $350,000.

**Action Item:** Dr. Walker to submit funding request to Governor's office by May 8, 1981.

### DECISIONS MADE

1. Wells G and H will remain permanently closed pending complete remediation
2. Epidemiological investigation will be expanded to include additional health outcomes beyond leukemia
3. Environmental testing program will be extended throughout the Aberjona River watershed
4. Legal action against responsible parties will be pursued following completion of source identification
5. Weekly coordination meetings will continue through the active investigation phase
