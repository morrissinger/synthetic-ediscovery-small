# MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEM PEAK DEMAND AND WELL G SUPPLEMENTAL PUMPING REPORT

**City of Woburn Water Department**  
Engineering Division  
Municipal Building, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801  

**Report No.:** WD-TR-1965-002  
**Date:** February 10, 1965  
**Prepared by:** Robert M. Henderson, P.E., City Water Department Engineer  
**Submitted to:** Thomas J. Sullivan, Water Department Superintendent  

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents an analysis of peak water demand patterns and the operational performance of Well G during the period from January 1964 through January 1965. Well G, commissioned in March 1964, has served as a critical supplemental water source during periods of high municipal demand, particularly during summer months and periods of drought conditions affecting our primary surface water sources.

The well has demonstrated reliable pumping capacity of 400 gallons per minute at optimal operating conditions, contributing approximately 15-20% of total system capacity during peak demand periods. Water quality testing conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines has shown Well G water to meet all applicable standards for municipal consumption.

## INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

The City of Woburn's water distribution system serves approximately 35,000 residents through a network of transmission mains, distribution lines, and storage facilities. Prior to 1964, the system relied primarily on surface water sources and existing wells in the western portion of the city. Growing residential development in East Woburn, combined with increased industrial water usage, necessitated the development of additional groundwater resources to meet peak demand requirements.

Well G was sited in the eastern section of the city following extensive hydrogeological surveys conducted by Whitman & Howard Engineers in 1963. The location was selected based on aquifer yield potential, proximity to existing distribution infrastructure, and the ability to serve the expanding East Woburn residential areas effectively.

## WELL G SPECIFICATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION

**Location:** Eastern Woburn, approximately 800 feet southwest of the Aberjona River  
**Coordinates:** 42°29'15"N, 71°09'30"W  
**Total Depth:** 88 feet  
**Casing Diameter:** 12 inches  
**Screen Interval:** 65-85 feet below ground surface  
**Pump Installation:** Submersible turbine pump, 400 GPM capacity  
**Construction Completed:** March 15, 1964  
**Initial Operations:** March 22, 1964  

The well penetrates unconsolidated glacial deposits consisting of sand and gravel overlying bedrock. Static water level was measured at 12 feet below ground surface at the time of construction. Pumping tests conducted during well development indicated sustainable yield of 450 GPM with drawdown of 8 feet.

## OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### Pumping Records and System Integration

Since commencing operations in March 1964, Well G has been operated primarily during peak demand periods, typically from May through September, and during maintenance periods affecting other system components. The well has been integrated into the East Woburn distribution zone, serving residential areas east of Main Street (Route 38).

**Monthly Pumping Summary (March 1964 - January 1965):**

| Month | Total Pumpage (Million Gallons) | Operating Hours | Average Daily Production |
|-------|--------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Mar 1964 | 2.1 | 89 | 0.23 MGD |
| Apr 1964 | 8.7 | 362 | 0.29 MGD |
| May 1964 | 12.4 | 421 | 0.40 MGD |
| Jun 1964 | 15.8 | 526 | 0.53 MGD |
| Jul 1964 | 18.2 | 607 | 0.59 MGD |
| Aug 1964 | 17.6 | 587 | 0.57 MGD |
| Sep 1964 | 14.1 | 470 | 0.47 MGD |
| Oct 1964 | 6.8 | 227 | 0.22 MGD |
| Nov 1964 | 3.2 | 107 | 0.11 MGD |
| Dec 1964 | 2.9 | 97 | 0.09 MGD |
| Jan 1965 | 3.1 | 103 | 0.10 MGD |

Peak pumping occurred during July 1964, coinciding with maximum residential water usage and reduced yield from surface water sources due to drought conditions. The well's contribution during this period represented approximately 22% of total system production.

### System Pressure and Flow Distribution

Well G operates within the East Woburn pressure zone, maintaining system pressure between 45-65 psi throughout its service area. Flow distribution analysis indicates effective coverage of residential areas including Pine Street, Salem Street, and portions of Main Street. No significant pressure complaints have been received from customers in the Well G service area since operations commenced.

Water main flow measurements taken at key distribution points show adequate hydraulic capacity to handle Well G production without adverse effects on system pressure or flow characteristics in adjacent zones.

## WATER QUALITY MONITORING

Water quality testing has been conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations for municipal water supplies. Samples are collected monthly from the wellhead and quarterly from representative points in the distribution system.

### Chemical Analysis Results

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Color: Less than 5 units (Standard: 15 units max)
- Turbidity: 0.2-0.8 NTU (Standard: 1.0 NTU max)
- Odor: None detected
- Taste: None detected

**Chemical Parameters (Average Values, March 1964 - January 1965):**
- pH: 6.8 (Range: 6.5-7.2)
- Total Dissolved Solids: 245 mg/L
- Hardness (as CaCO3): 180 mg/L
- Iron: 0.08 mg/L (Standard: 0.3 mg/L max)
- Manganese: 0.02 mg/L (Standard: 0.05 mg/L max)
- Chloride: 28 mg/L (Standard: 250 mg/L max)
- Sulfate: 35 mg/L (Standard: 250 mg/L max)

### Bacteriological Testing

Monthly bacteriological testing has consistently shown absence of coliform bacteria, indicating no bacterial contamination of the water supply. All samples have met Massachusetts Department of Public Health standards for municipal water supplies.

### Organic Compounds

Routine testing for organic compounds is not currently required by state regulations. However, given the industrial activity in the broader Woburn area, consideration should be given to periodic testing for industrial solvents and related compounds as analytical capabilities improve.

## MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES

Well G has operated reliably throughout its first year of service. Routine maintenance activities have included:

- Monthly pump performance testing
- Quarterly electrical system inspection
- Semi-annual well head inspection and security check
- Annual pump efficiency evaluation

Minor operational issues encountered include:
- Temporary pump motor overheating during July 1964 high-demand period (resolved with improved ventilation)
- Occasional fluctuations in pumping rate during startup (attributed to variable power supply conditions)
- Accumulation of fine sediment in pump housing (addressed through quarterly pump cleaning)

- Well drilling and construction: $18,500
- Pump and motor installation: $12,200
- Electrical service and controls: $8,100
- Distribution system connections: $15,800
