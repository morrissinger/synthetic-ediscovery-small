## SITE DESCRIPTION

The former Beatrice Foods property encompasses approximately 15 acres of mixed industrial and vacant land. The facility operated as a food processing plant from 1963 to 1978, with various ancillary operations including equipment maintenance, chemical storage, and waste management activities. The property is situated approximately 1,200 feet northeast of municipal Well G and 1,800 feet north-northwest of municipal Well H.

### Topographical Features
The property exhibits a gradual slope from northwest to southeast, with elevation changes of approximately 8 feet across the site. Surface drainage patterns indicate potential groundwater flow toward the southeast, in the direction of the municipal well fields.

## PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION

### Area A: Primary Chemical Storage Building

**Photographs 001-012**

The primary chemical storage building, a concrete block structure measuring approximately 40 x 60 feet, shows extensive evidence of chemical handling operations. Multiple staining patterns on concrete floors indicate repeated spills or leakage of various substances.

**Key Observations:**
- Dark staining on concrete floor covering approximately 400 square feet
- Multiple 55-gallon drum storage areas with residual chemical odors
- Corroded floor drains leading to unknown discharge points
- Damaged concrete with visible cracking and deterioration
- Ventilation system shows chemical corrosion damage

**Photograph 003** documents a particularly significant staining pattern near the building's southeast corner, measuring approximately 12 x 8 feet. The staining exhibits characteristics consistent with chlorinated solvent spills, including a distinctive blue-green discoloration and crystalline residue formations.

**Photograph 007** shows evidence of drum storage arrangements, with circular staining patterns indicating long-term storage of multiple containers. Rust stains and chemical residues suggest inadequate containment measures during storage operations.

### Area B: Outdoor Storage and Loading Areas

**Photographs 013-023**

The outdoor storage areas reveal extensive evidence of chemical handling operations conducted without adequate environmental controls. Surface staining, vegetation damage, and soil discoloration indicate repeated exposure to industrial chemicals.

**Key Observations:**
- Approximately 2,000 square feet of stained concrete and asphalt
- Dead and stunted vegetation in circular patterns around storage areas
- Visible soil discoloration extending 3-5 feet beyond paved surfaces
- Multiple drum storage locations with permanent staining
- Evidence of surface water pooling and potential runoff pathways

**Photograph 016** documents a significant area of soil contamination measuring approximately 25 x 15 feet, located adjacent to the main loading dock. Soil samples from this area exhibited strong chemical odors and visible discoloration to a depth of 18 inches.

**Photograph 019** shows evidence of improper waste disposal practices, including buried containers partially exposed by erosion. Metal containers show extensive corrosion consistent with chemical exposure over extended periods.

### Area C: Waste Disposal and Burial Areas

**Photographs 024-035**

Investigation of the property's western boundary revealed multiple areas of suspected waste burial and disposal activities. Surface depressions, unusual vegetation patterns, and exposed debris indicate systematic disposal of industrial waste materials.

**Key Observations:**
- Three distinct depression areas suggesting waste burial sites
- Exposed metal containers and piping systems
- Chemical odors emanating from disturbed soil areas
- Unusual vegetation patterns indicating subsurface contamination
- Evidence of fill material containing industrial debris

**Photograph 027** documents a partially exposed 55-gallon drum showing extensive corrosion and apparent breaching. The drum's contents had clearly leaked into surrounding soils, creating a contamination plume visible through vegetation damage extending approximately 30 feet in a southeastern direction.

**Photograph 031** shows evidence of a systematic burial operation, with multiple containers arranged in what appears to be an organized disposal pattern. Exposed portions of at least six containers are visible, with additional buried materials indicated by surface depressions.

### Area D: Storm Water Management Systems

**Photographs 036-047**

The property's storm water management systems show extensive evidence of contamination and inadequate environmental controls. Catch basins, drainage ditches, and outfall structures contain visible chemical residues and exhibit characteristics consistent with long-term exposure to industrial solvents.

**Key Observations:**
- Chemical sheens visible in standing water within catch basins
- Sediment deposits showing unusual coloration and chemical odors
- Corroded metal components in drainage structures
- Vegetation damage along drainage pathways
- Evidence of direct discharge to surface water systems

**Photograph 041** documents a significant accumulation of contaminated sediments within the main drainage outfall structure. Sediment samples exhibited strong solvent odors and showed visible separation of organic compounds when disturbed.

**Photograph 045** shows the final outfall point where site drainage enters the broader watershed. Chemical staining on concrete structures and damaged vegetation indicate long-term discharge of contaminated water from the property.

## ANALYTICAL OBSERVATIONS

### Chemical Indicators
Visual and olfactory evidence suggests the presence of multiple chlorinated solvents throughout the documented areas. Characteristic blue-green staining patterns, crystalline residue formations, and distinctive solvent odors are consistent with trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene contamination.

### Environmental Impact Patterns
Vegetation damage patterns and soil discoloration indicate contamination migration beyond the immediate storage and disposal areas. The documented contamination extends in a southeastern direction, consistent with known groundwater flow patterns toward municipal Wells G and H.

### Structural Deterioration
Chemical exposure has caused significant deterioration of concrete, metal, and other structural materials throughout the facility. This deterioration indicates long-term, repeated exposure to industrial solvents and other hazardous chemicals.

## CONCLUSIONS

The photographic documentation reveals extensive evidence of improper chemical storage, handling, and disposal practices at the former Beatrice Foods property. The documented conditions indicate:

1. **Systematic Environmental Contamination:** Multiple areas of the property show evidence of significant chemical contamination resulting from inadequate storage and disposal practices.

2. **Migration Pathways:** Contamination patterns and drainage systems provide clear pathways for chemical migration toward municipal water supply wells.

3. **Long-term Operations:** The extent and nature of contamination indicates these practices occurred over extended periods, consistent with the facility's operational timeline from 1963 to 1978.

4. **Regulatory Violations:** The documented conditions appear to violate multiple environmental regulations regarding chemical storage, waste disposal, and groundwater protection.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Soil and Groundwater Sampling:** Comprehensive sampling should be conducted in all documented contamination areas to quantify the extent and concentration of chemical contamination.

2. **
