# Request for Chemical Analysis Information Wells G and H

February 10, 1981

Dear Sir or Madam:

My name is Anne Anderson, and I am writing to you as a concerned mother and resident of Woburn, Massachusetts. I live at 11 Orange Street, where I have resided for seventeen years with my three children. On January 18th of this year, my youngest son James died of acute lymphocytic leukemia at the age of twelve. He had battled this terrible disease for nine years, having been diagnosed in January 1972 when he was only three years old.

I am writing to request any and all information that your agency may have regarding the chemical analysis of our municipal water wells, specifically Wells G and H, which have supplied water to our neighborhood since they opened in 1964 and 1966. My family has relied on this water supply throughout James's entire life, and I have recently become aware that there may have been contamination issues with these wells that were never disclosed to the residents of our community.

During the years of James's illness, I never questioned the safety of our tap water. Like any mother, I gave my son water to drink, cooked his meals with it, and bathed him in it, trusting that our municipal water supply was safe and properly monitored. My other two children, Christine and Charles, have also consumed this water throughout their lives. Christine is now twenty years old and Charles is sixteen, and they have both watched their little brother suffer through treatments, hospitalizations, and ultimately succumb to this devastating disease.

I have heard rumors in our neighborhood that there may have been industrial chemicals found in Wells G and H, possibly including substances called trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. If this is true, I need to know when these chemicals were first detected, at what levels they were found, and why the residents of Woburn were never informed of any potential health risks. As a mother who has lost her child to leukemia, I have a right to know whether the water I gave my son every day of his life may have contributed to his illness and death.

I understand that your agency has a responsibility to protect public health and the environment. If there has been contamination of our water supply, and if government agencies knew about it but failed to warn us, then there has been a fundamental breach of the duty of care owed to the families of this community. We trusted that our water was safe because we believed that agencies like yours were monitoring it and would alert us to any dangers.

The loss of my son has devastated our family, but if his death can help prevent other families from experiencing this same tragedy, then I am determined to pursue every avenue available to uncover the truth. Other children in our neighborhood have also been diagnosed with leukemia, and I believe there may be a connection to our water supply that has been hidden from us for far too long.

I am requesting the following information under the Freedom of Information Act:

1. All chemical analysis reports for Wells G and H from 1964 to the present
2. Any correspondence between the EPA and the City of Woburn regarding water quality issues
3. Any reports or studies regarding potential contamination sources in the Woburn area
4. Any health advisories or warnings that were issued or considered regarding the safety of Wells G and H
5. Any communications with industrial facilities in the Woburn area regarding waste disposal practices

I understand that some of this information may take time to compile, but I am prepared to wait as long as necessary to get answers. My son James can never be brought back, but if negligence on the part of government agencies or industrial companies contributed to his death, then those responsible must be held accountable.

I have enclosed a copy of James's death certificate as documentation of our family's loss. I can be reached at my home address or by telephone at (617) 935-2847 during the day. I work part-time at the Woburn Public Library, so I may not always be available, but I will return any calls as soon as possible.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and to receiving the information I have requested. The families of Woburn deserve to know the truth about what has been done to our water supply and our children.

Sincerely,

Anne Anderson  
11 Orange Street  
Woburn, Massachusetts 01801

P.S. If your agency has any information about other potential health effects from the chemicals that may have contaminated our water, I would appreciate receiving that information as well. As the mother of two surviving children who have also been exposed to this water throughout their lives, I am deeply concerned about their future health and well-being.
