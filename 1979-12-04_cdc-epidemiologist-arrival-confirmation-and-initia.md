# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Dr. Michael Thompson, Director of Environmental Health Services  
**FROM:** Dr. Alan Silbergeld, Senior Epidemiologist  
**DATE:** December 4, 1979  
**RE:** Arrival Confirmation and Initial Field Observations - East Woburn Investigation

## Status Update

I arrived in East Woburn this morning at 0800 hours and have established temporary field operations at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health regional office at 305 South Street. Initial coordination meetings have been completed with Dr. Patricia Murphy from Mass DPH and representatives from the EPA Region I office in Boston.

The situation here is more complex than initially briefed. The closure of Wells G and H in May following VOC detection has created significant community concern, particularly given the preliminary health data suggesting elevated childhood leukemia rates in the affected neighborhoods. Local families are demanding answers, and several have already retained legal counsel.

## Preliminary Field Assessment

My initial site reconnaissance this morning revealed the geographic proximity of multiple industrial facilities to the affected wells. The W.R. Grace/Cryovac facility at 369 Washington Street sits approximately 1,200 feet northeast of Well G, with clear topographical drainage patterns toward the well field. The former John J. Riley tannery property, now owned by Beatrice Foods, lies southwest of the wells and shows visible signs of past industrial activity including discolored soil and vegetation stress patterns.

Water sampling records from May 1979 show trichloroethylene concentrations of 267 parts per billion in Well G and 21.4 ppb in Well H - levels far exceeding any reasonable safety threshold. Of particular concern is the duration of exposure, as these wells operated continuously from 1964-1979, serving approximately 5,000 residents in the eastern sections of the city.

## Community Health Concerns

The Massachusetts Cancer Registry data provided preliminary support for community reports of unusual childhood cancer rates. Between 1969 and 1979, twelve cases of childhood leukemia were diagnosed among families served by Wells G and H - a rate approximately six times higher than expected for a population of this size. Six of these children have died, including James Anderson, age 3; Kevin Kane Jr., age 2; and Michael Zona, age 6.

Mrs. Anne Anderson has emerged as the primary community advocate and has compiled extensive documentation of affected families. Her organizational efforts have been instrumental in bringing this situation to public attention and will likely be crucial to our epidemiological investigation.

## Immediate Action Items

I am coordinating with EPA to expedite comprehensive groundwater testing throughout the affected area. Additional soil samples will be collected from the Grace and Beatrice properties this week, pending access agreements. The Massachusetts Attorney General's office has indicated they may pursue enforcement action, which could complicate our access to certain industrial sites.

Dr. Murphy and I will begin door-to-door health surveys in the Pine Street, Salem Street, and East Woburn neighborhoods beginning December 6th. We anticipate completing initial family interviews within ten days, focusing on residential history, water consumption patterns, and detailed medical histories for all household members.

## Resource Requirements

This investigation will require extended field presence. I recommend assigning Dr. Sarah Chen from our Atlanta office to assist with the epidemiological analysis, particularly given the complexity of establishing exposure pathways and temporal relationships. Additional laboratory support will be needed for tissue sample analysis if we proceed with biomarker studies.

The legal implications of this case are significant. Corporate counsel for both W.R. Grace and Beatrice Foods have already contacted the regional EPA office expressing concerns about our investigation scope. I recommend coordinating all communications through CDC legal affairs to ensure proper documentation of our findings.

I will provide daily status updates through December 15th and a comprehensive preliminary report by December 20th. The community deserves answers, and the potential public health implications of this contamination extend far beyond East Woburn.
