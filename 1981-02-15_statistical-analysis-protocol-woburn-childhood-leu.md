# Statistical Analysis Protocol
## Woburn Childhood Leukemia Study Design

**Centers for Disease Control**  
Epidemiology Program Office  
Atlanta, Georgia 30333

**TO:** Dr. Patricia Fleming, Chief, Epidemiology Division  
**FROM:** Dr. Robert Chen, Senior Epidemiologist  
**DATE:** February 15, 1981  
**SUBJECT:** Statistical Analysis Protocol for Woburn Childhood Leukemia Cluster Investigation

---

## Executive Summary

This technical report outlines the statistical methodology and analytical framework for investigating the childhood leukemia cluster in East Woburn, Massachusetts. Following the recent death of James Anderson on January 18, 1981, and mounting community concerns regarding potential environmental causation, the CDC has been requested by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to provide epidemiological expertise in determining whether the observed cluster represents a statistically significant deviation from expected childhood leukemia incidence rates.

## Background and Objectives

### Study Rationale

The East Woburn community has reported an apparent cluster of childhood leukemia cases, with particular concentration in families residing near municipal Wells G and H. Preliminary investigation indicates that these wells, operational since 1964 and 1966 respectively, may have been contaminated with industrial solvents including trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE). The primary objective of this analysis is to determine whether the observed incidence of childhood leukemia in the affected area exceeds expected rates based on population demographics and established epidemiological baselines.

### Specific Aims

1. Calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for childhood leukemia in the study area
2. Perform temporal analysis of case occurrence relative to well activation dates
3. Assess spatial clustering patterns using geographic information systems
4. Evaluate dose-response relationships between water consumption and disease incidence
5. Conduct comparative analysis with control populations

## Methodology

### Study Population Definition

**Primary Study Area:** Census tracts served by Wells G and H in East Woburn, Massachusetts  
**Study Period:** 1964-1981 (corresponding to well operational period)  
**Case Definition:** Acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed in children aged 0-19 years, confirmed by medical record review and pathology reports  
**Population Base:** Resident population enumerated in 1970 and 1980 U.S. Census data

### Data Collection Protocol

#### Case Identification

Cases will be identified through multiple sources to ensure completeness:
- Massachusetts Cancer Registry records
- Hospital discharge databases from area medical facilities
- Physician reporting through Massachusetts Department of Public Health surveillance system
- Death certificate review for leukemia-related mortality

#### Exposure Assessment

Water consumption exposure will be quantified using the following parameters:
- Residential address history during study period
- Duration of residence in served areas
- Estimated daily water consumption by age group
- Chemical concentration data from Wells G and H monitoring records
- Temporal variations in contamination levels

### Statistical Analysis Plan

#### Descriptive Analysis

**Incidence Rate Calculation:**
- Age-specific incidence rates per 100,000 person-years
- Standardization using 1970 U.S. population as reference
- Confidence intervals calculated using Poisson distribution assumptions

**Temporal Trends:**
- Time series analysis of case occurrence by year
- Seasonal pattern evaluation using chi-square goodness-of-fit tests
- Change-point analysis to identify significant temporal shifts

#### Analytical Methods

**Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR):**
SIR = Observed Cases / Expected Cases

Where expected cases are calculated using:
E = Σ(ni × ri)

Where ni = population in age stratum i, and ri = reference incidence rate for stratum i

**Spatial Analysis:**
- Knox test for space-time clustering
- Nearest neighbor analysis using Euclidean distances
- Kernel density estimation for case distribution mapping

**Dose-Response Assessment:**
Multiple logistic regression modeling with the following variables:
- Cumulative TCE exposure (mg/L-years)
- Cumulative PCE exposure (mg/L-years)
- Age at first exposure
- Duration of exposure
- Potential confounding factors (socioeconomic status, family history)

### Power Calculations

Based on preliminary case counts and population estimates:
- Study population: approximately 5,000 children aged 0-19
- Background incidence rate: 4.2 per 100,000 per year
- Expected cases over 17-year period: 3.6 cases
- Observed cases: 12 cases (preliminary count)
- Statistical power: >90% to detect 3-fold increase in risk (α = 0.05)

## Quality Assurance Measures

### Data Validation

1. **Medical Record Review:** Independent verification of leukemia diagnoses by certified hematologist-oncologist
2. **Exposure Verification:** Cross-reference residential histories with city directories and utility billing records
3. **Laboratory Confirmation:** Validate water contamination data through EPA analytical reports

### Bias Minimization

**Selection Bias:** Systematic case-finding through multiple independent sources
**Information Bias:** Standardized data collection instruments and trained personnel
**Confounding Control:** Stratified analysis and multivariate modeling

## Regulatory and Legal Considerations

This analysis will adhere to established CDC guidelines for cluster investigations while maintaining scientific objectivity. The statistical methodology has been designed to meet evidentiary standards for potential legal proceedings, with particular attention to:

1. **Causation Assessment:** Bradford Hill criteria evaluation for environmental causation
2. **Documentation Standards:** Maintenance of complete audit trail for all analytical procedures
3. **Expert Testimony Preparation:** Statistical results suitable for courtroom presentation

## Timeline and Deliverables

**Phase I (February-April 1981):** Data collection and preliminary analysis  
**Phase II (May-July 1981):** Statistical analysis and modeling  
**Phase III (August-September 1981):** Report preparation and peer review  
**Final Report:** October 1981

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The proposed statistical analysis protocol provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the Woburn childhood leukemia cluster using established epidemiological methods. The methodology is designed to produce scientifically rigorous results that can inform public health decision-making and support regulatory action if environmental causation is demonstrated.

Given the gravity of the situation, particularly following the recent death of James Anderson, expedited analysis is recommended while maintaining strict adherence to scientific protocols. The statistical power calculations indicate sufficient sample size to detect meaningful increases in leukemia risk, providing confidence in the study's ability to address community concerns and regulatory requirements.
