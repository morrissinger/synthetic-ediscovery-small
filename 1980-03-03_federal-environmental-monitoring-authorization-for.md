**SUBJECT:** Federal Environmental Monitoring Authorization for Grace Property - Groundwater Contamination Investigation

## AUTHORIZATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

Pursuant to the authority vested in the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq.), and in accordance with federal regulations codified at 40 CFR Parts 141 and 143, the Environmental Protection Agency hereby issues this Federal Environmental Monitoring Authorization for the property owned and operated by W.R. Grace Company through its subsidiary Cryovac Inc., located at 369 Washington Street, East Woburn, Massachusetts.

This authorization is issued following the discovery of volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethylene (TCE), in municipal Wells G and H serving the East Woburn community. Initial testing conducted in May 1979 revealed contamination levels exceeding federal drinking water standards, necessitating the immediate closure of said wells and the initiation of a comprehensive environmental investigation.

## SCOPE OF MONITORING REQUIREMENTS

**1. Groundwater Monitoring Network**

W.R. Grace Company is hereby authorized and required to establish a comprehensive groundwater monitoring network on and adjacent to the Cryovac facility property. This network shall consist of no fewer than twelve (12) monitoring wells positioned to determine the extent and migration patterns of subsurface contamination. The monitoring well network shall be designed and installed in accordance with EPA Technical Standard Operating Procedures and shall include:

- Four (4) upgradient monitoring wells to establish background conditions
- Six (6) downgradient monitoring wells positioned between the facility and Wells G and H
- Two (2) deep aquifer monitoring wells to assess vertical migration

**2. Sampling and Analysis Protocol**

Monthly groundwater sampling shall be conducted at all monitoring locations for a minimum period of twenty-four (24) months. Analytical testing shall include, but not be limited to:

- Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) including trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and related chlorinated solvents
- Semi-volatile organic compounds associated with industrial operations
- Heavy metals including chromium, lead, and arsenic
- General water quality parameters including pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen

All sampling and analytical procedures shall conform to EPA Method 624 for volatile organics and EPA Method 625 for semi-volatiles. Chain of custody procedures shall be strictly maintained, and all analyses shall be performed by EPA-certified laboratories.

**3. Waste Disposal History Documentation**

W.R. Grace Company shall provide comprehensive documentation regarding historical waste disposal practices at the Cryovac facility. This documentation shall include:

- Complete inventory of chemicals used, stored, or disposed of on the property from 1960 to present
- Detailed description of waste disposal methods and locations
- Engineering drawings and specifications for any underground storage tanks, waste lagoons, or disposal areas
- Records of any spills, releases, or environmental incidents

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND DUTY OF CARE

This monitoring authorization is issued in recognition of the corporate duty of care owed by W.R. Grace Company to the surrounding community. The contamination of Wells G and H has resulted in the disruption of the municipal water supply serving approximately 5,000 residents of East Woburn, creating potential public health risks that demand immediate and comprehensive response.

The duty of care extends beyond mere compliance with existing regulations to encompass the affirmative obligation to identify, investigate, and remediate environmental contamination that may have resulted from industrial operations. This principle, well-established in environmental law, requires that corporations engaged in the use and disposal of hazardous substances exercise the highest degree of care to prevent environmental harm.

W.R. Grace Company's cooperation in this monitoring program represents a critical component of fulfilling this duty of care. The data collected through this monitoring network will inform decisions regarding remedial action, alternative water supply provisions, and long-term environmental protection measures.

## REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

**Monthly Reports:** Beginning April 15, 1980, W.R. Grace Company shall submit monthly monitoring reports to EPA Region I containing:

- Complete analytical results for all monitoring locations
- Groundwater elevation data and flow direction analysis
- Quality assurance/quality control documentation
- Assessment of contamination trends and plume migration

**Quarterly Assessments:** Comprehensive quarterly reports shall evaluate contamination patterns, assess potential impacts to Wells G and H, and recommend additional monitoring or remedial measures as appropriate.

**Annual Summary:** An annual comprehensive report shall synthesize all monitoring data, assess the effectiveness of the monitoring program, and provide recommendations for program modifications or remedial action.

## LEGAL AUTHORITY AND ENFORCEMENT

This authorization is issued under the federal environmental statutes cited above and carries the full force of federal law. Failure to comply with the requirements set forth herein may result in enforcement action including civil penalties up to $10,000 per day per violation, injunctive relief, and criminal prosecution where appropriate.

The Environmental Protection Agency reserves the right to modify, expand, or terminate this monitoring authorization based on data collected during the monitoring period. Additional requirements may be imposed if monitoring results indicate more extensive contamination or greater potential for public health impact than currently understood.

## COORDINATION WITH STATE AUTHORITIES

This federal monitoring authorization shall be coordinated with ongoing investigations by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering. W.R. Grace Company shall provide copies of all monitoring reports and data to these state agencies and shall cooperate fully with any additional state-mandated monitoring or remedial requirements.

The EPA acknowledges the serious nature of the groundwater contamination affecting the East Woburn community and the urgent need for comprehensive investigation and response. This monitoring program represents the first phase of what may be an extended environmental investigation and remediation effort.

## EFFECTIVE DATE AND IMPLEMENTATION

This Federal Environmental Monitoring Authorization becomes effective immediately upon receipt by W.R. Grace Company. Installation of the monitoring well network shall commence within thirty (30) days of this authorization, with the first sampling event to occur within sixty (60) days.

W.R. Grace Company shall provide written acknowledgment of receipt of this authorization and commitment to full compliance within ten (10) business days of receipt.
