**TO:** Corporate Environmental Compliance Department  
**FROM:** Robert H. Mitchell, Facility Operations Manager  
**DATE:** October 22, 1967  
**RE:** Monthly Chemical Inventory and Usage Report - October 1967

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report provides a comprehensive overview of chemical inventory levels, usage patterns, and disposal activities at the Woburn Manufacturing Facility for the month of October 1967. Total chemical consumption increased 12% over September levels due to expanded production of Cryovac packaging materials to meet fourth-quarter demand projections. All disposal activities have been conducted in accordance with current Massachusetts Department of Health guidelines and company standard operating procedures.

## WASTE DISPOSAL OPERATIONS

### Liquid Waste Management

During October 1967, the facility generated approximately 8,750 gallons of liquid chemical waste requiring disposal. Disposal methods employed include:

**On-site Disposal Area (Lagoons)**
- Volume disposed: 6,200 gallons
- Waste composition: Diluted cleaning solvents, rinse water, equipment washdown
- Location: Eastern section of property, approximately 400 feet from Aberjona River
- Method: Direct discharge to unlined lagoons for evaporation and soil infiltration

**Drum Storage for Off-site Disposal**
- Volume stored: 2,550 gallons
- Container type: 55-gallon steel drums (46 drums total)
- Storage location: Northwest corner of facility
- Scheduled pickup: November 15, 1967 (Acme Chemical Disposal Services)

### Solid Waste and Contaminated Materials

Solid chemical waste totaling approximately 2.3 tons was generated during October operations:

- Contaminated rags and absorbent materials: 850 pounds
- Spent filter cartridges: 420 pounds
- Dried sludge from cleaning operations: 1,030 pounds
- Disposal method: Burial in on-site disposal area, eastern property boundary

## OPERATIONAL INCIDENTS AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

### Minor Spill Events

**October 8, 1967**
- Material: Approximately 25 gallons of TCE
- Location: Loading dock area
- Cause: Damaged valve during unloading operations
- Response: Immediate containment with sand, affected soil excavated and disposed in on-site burial area
- Personnel exposure: None reported

**October 19, 1967**
- Material: Approximately 15 gallons of PCE
- Location: Production floor, Building C
- Cause: Operator error during transfer operations
- Response: Area ventilated, spilled material collected with absorbent, contaminated materials disposed via on-site burial
- Personnel exposure: Two operators reported brief exposure, no medical treatment required

### Equipment Maintenance

Routine maintenance on vapor degreasing units resulted in the discharge of approximately 150 gallons of spent solvent directly to the on-site lagoon system. This discharge was conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures and represents normal operational practice for equipment servicing.

## ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

### Air Quality

Monthly air sampling conducted October 25, 1967, by Industrial Hygiene Associates of Boston showed the following results:
- TCE (8-hour TWA): 85 ppm (within ACGIH guidelines of 100 ppm)
- PCE (8-hour TWA): 78 ppm (within ACGIH guidelines of 100 ppm)
- All measurements taken at breathing zone level in production areas

### Water Quality

Quarterly groundwater monitoring is not currently required under Massachusetts regulations. However, visual inspection of on-site wells shows no apparent contamination. Municipal water supply monitoring is the responsibility of the City of Woburn Water Department.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

All disposal activities during October 1967 have been conducted in compliance with:
- Massachusetts Department of Health Regulations, Chapter 15
- Woburn Municipal Ordinances regarding industrial operations
- Company Environmental Policy Manual, Revision 3 (March 1967)

No regulatory inspections were conducted during the reporting period. The facility maintains current permits for air emissions and industrial operations as required by state and local authorities.

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE PLANNING

### Inventory Management

Current chemical storage levels are adequate to meet projected November production requirements. However, we recommend increasing TCE inventory by 5,000 gallons to accommodate anticipated December production increases for holiday packaging demands.

### Disposal Capacity

The on-site lagoon system continues to provide adequate disposal capacity for liquid wastes. Recent dry weather conditions have enhanced evaporation rates, maintaining available capacity within acceptable limits. No modifications to current disposal practices are recommended at this time.

### Cost Optimization

Chemical usage efficiency improved 3% over September levels due to enhanced recovery procedures in the degreasing operations. Continued focus on solvent recovery and reuse will help manage increasing raw material costs while maintaining production quality standards.

## CONCLUSION

October 1967 operations proceeded smoothly with no significant environmental incidents or regulatory concerns. Chemical inventory management remains within normal parameters, and all disposal activities have been conducted according to established procedures. The facility continues to operate in full compliance with applicable environmental regulations while meeting production targets for the fourth quarter.
