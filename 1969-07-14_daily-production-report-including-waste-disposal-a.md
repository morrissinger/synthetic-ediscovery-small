# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Plant Manager  
**FROM:** Robert Chen, Production Supervisor  
**DATE:** July 14, 1969  
**RE:** Daily Production Report Including Waste Disposal Activities

## Production Summary

Today's production run proceeded according to schedule with minimal equipment downtime. Line 3 experienced a brief shutdown at 0945 hours due to heating element replacement, resulting in approximately 35 minutes of lost production time. Total output for the day reached 12,400 units across all production lines, representing 96% of daily target capacity.

Quality control inspections identified three batches requiring rework due to seal integrity issues on Line 2. These batches have been set aside for reprocessing tomorrow morning. Raw material inventory levels remain adequate for the remainder of the week, with the next scheduled delivery of polyethylene resins expected Thursday.

## Waste Disposal Operations

As per standard operating procedures, today's waste disposal activities included the removal of approximately 240 gallons of mixed solvents and cleaning solutions to the designated disposal area behind Building C. The waste consisted primarily of trichloroethylene cleaning solutions used in equipment maintenance, along with smaller quantities of tetrachloroethylene and other degreasing compounds. Maintenance supervisor Jim Walsh oversaw the transfer of these materials to the designated pit area at approximately 1115 hours.

Additionally, 85 gallons of process wastewater containing trace amounts of production chemicals were discharged to the rear drainage system as authorized under current disposal protocols. The discharge occurred during the routine equipment cleaning cycle between 1400 and 1430 hours. Visual inspection of the drainage area showed normal flow patterns toward the wooded area east of the facility.

## Equipment Status and Maintenance Notes

Routine maintenance on the primary heating systems proceeded without incident. The replacement heating element on Line 3 is functioning within normal parameters. Scheduled preventive maintenance on the solvent recovery system has been postponed until next Monday to avoid disruption of this week's production targets.

The ventilation system in Building B continues to operate effectively, maintaining adequate air circulation during today's cleaning operations involving chlorinated solvents. No unusual odors or vapor concentrations were detected during routine facility inspections.

I will continue to monitor production efficiency and ensure all disposal activities are conducted in accordance with established company procedures. Please contact me if you require additional details regarding today's operations or waste management activities.
