## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

W.R. Grace & Co. hereby submits this quarterly environmental compliance report for our Woburn manufacturing facility located at 201 Montvale Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts, in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21, Section 43 and applicable DEP regulations promulgated thereunder. This report covers facility operations and environmental management activities for the period January 1, 1975 through March 31, 1975.

The Woburn facility continues to operate in full compliance with all applicable state environmental regulations. Our manufacturing processes, waste management protocols, and discharge procedures have been maintained within established operational parameters throughout the reporting period. No significant environmental incidents or regulatory violations occurred during this quarter.

## II. FACILITY OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

### Manufacturing Activities

During the first quarter of 1975, the Woburn facility maintained normal production schedules for our specialty chemical manufacturing operations. Primary production activities included:

- **Cryovac Division Operations**: Continued production of plastic packaging materials utilizing established polymer processing techniques. Monthly production volumes averaged 2,847 tons of finished product, consistent with fourth quarter 1974 levels.

- **Chemical Processing**: Routine manufacturing of industrial solvents and chemical intermediates for distribution to regional customers. Production utilized standard batch processing methods with established quality control protocols.

- **Equipment Maintenance**: Scheduled maintenance activities were completed on Manufacturing Lines 3 and 5 during the February production shutdown. All equipment inspections revealed normal wear patterns with no significant maintenance issues identified.

### Workforce and Safety

The facility maintained an average workforce of 187 employees during the reporting period. Safety training programs continued as scheduled, with quarterly safety meetings conducted for all production personnel. No reportable workplace injuries occurred during this quarter, maintaining our exemplary safety record established over the previous eighteen months.

## III. WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL PRACTICES

### Solid Waste Management

W.R. Grace maintains comprehensive solid waste management protocols in accordance with applicable state regulations. During the first quarter of 1975:

- **Non-hazardous Manufacturing Waste**: Approximately 847 cubic yards of non-hazardous solid waste were generated from normal manufacturing operations. This material was disposed of through contracted waste management services utilizing approved disposal sites in accordance with DEP requirements.

- **Packaging and Administrative Waste**: Standard office and packaging waste totaling 156 cubic yards was handled through municipal waste collection services provided by the City of Woburn.

### Chemical Waste Handling

All chemical waste materials generated during manufacturing operations were managed through established protocols developed in consultation with environmental engineering specialists. Chemical waste streams included:

- **Solvent Recovery Operations**: Waste solvents from cleaning and processing operations were processed through our on-site solvent recovery system, achieving a 73% recovery rate during the reporting period. Recovered solvents were returned to production use, reducing both waste generation and raw material costs.

- **Process Residuals**: Chemical residuals from batch processing operations were collected and stored in designated areas pending disposal through approved chemical waste contractors. All storage areas maintained appropriate containment systems and were inspected weekly by facility environmental personnel.

## IV. WATER USAGE AND DISCHARGE MONITORING

### Water Supply and Consumption

The Woburn facility obtained water for manufacturing and administrative purposes from the municipal water system operated by the City of Woburn. Total water consumption for the first quarter of 1975 was 2.7 million gallons, representing a 4% decrease from the comparable period in 1974 due to improved process efficiency measures implemented in late 1974.

### Wastewater Management

All process wastewater generated at the facility was managed through our permitted discharge system in accordance with NPDES permit requirements:

- **Process Water Treatment**: Manufacturing process water was treated through our primary clarification system before discharge to the municipal sewer system. Treatment efficiency averaged 89% removal of suspended solids during the reporting period.

- **Discharge Monitoring**: Monthly sampling of treated discharge water was conducted by certified laboratory personnel. All analytical results indicated compliance with permit limitations for pH, suspended solids, and other regulated parameters.

- **Record Keeping**: Complete records of all discharge monitoring activities were maintained on-site and are available for regulatory inspection as required.

## V. AIR EMISSIONS MANAGEMENT

### Emission Sources and Controls

Air emissions from the Woburn facility were generated primarily from manufacturing process equipment and building ventilation systems. All emission sources operated within established permit parameters:

- **Process Equipment Emissions**: Manufacturing equipment emissions were controlled through existing ventilation systems and emission control devices. Stack testing conducted in February 1975 confirmed continued compliance with air quality standards.

- **Fugitive Emissions**: Routine inspections of process equipment and storage areas were conducted to identify and address potential fugitive emission sources. No significant fugitive emission issues were identified during the reporting period.

### Monitoring and Compliance

Air quality monitoring activities continued as required by facility air permits. Monthly ambient air monitoring at designated locations around the facility perimeter showed all measured parameters within acceptable ranges established by DEP air quality standards.

## VI. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES

### Pollution Prevention Programs

W.R. Grace continued implementation of pollution prevention initiatives designed to reduce waste generation and improve environmental performance:

- **Process Optimization**: Engineering studies completed during the quarter identified opportunities to reduce solvent usage in Manufacturing Line 2 operations by an estimated 12% through improved process controls.

- **Equipment Upgrades**: Capital improvements approved for implementation in the second quarter of 1975 will enhance containment systems for chemical storage areas, further reducing potential environmental impacts.

### Employee Training and Awareness

Environmental awareness training programs were conducted for all facility personnel during the quarter. Training topics included proper waste handling procedures, emergency response protocols, and regulatory compliance requirements. Employee feedback indicated strong support for environmental protection initiatives.

## VII. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

### Permit Compliance

All facility operations continued in full compliance with applicable environmental permits and approvals:

- **Air Quality Permits**: Stack testing and monitoring results confirmed continued compliance with all air emission limitations and requirements.

- **Water Discharge Permits**: Discharge monitoring data demonstrated consistent compliance with NPDES permit limitations throughout the reporting period.

- **Waste Management Approvals**: All waste disposal activities were conducted in accordance with approved waste management plans and contractor certifications.

### Inspection Activities

No regulatory inspections of the Woburn facility were conducted during the first quarter of 1975. Facility management maintains ongoing readiness for regulatory inspections through regular internal compliance audits and staff training programs.

## VIII. FUTURE PLANNING AND COMMITMENTS

### Capital Improvements

W.R. Grace has approved capital expenditures totaling $347,000 for environmental improvements at the Woburn facility during 1975. Planned improvements include:

- **Secondary Containment Systems**: Installation of enhanced containment systems for chemical storage areas to provide additional protection against potential releases.

- **Process Equipment Upgrades**: Replacement of aging process equipment with more efficient systems designed to reduce waste generation and improve environmental performance.

### Regulatory Engagement

Facility management will continue active engagement with DEP personnel to ensure ongoing compliance with evolving environmental regulations. We anticipate participating in upcoming DEP workshops on industrial waste management best practices scheduled for the second quarter of 1975.
