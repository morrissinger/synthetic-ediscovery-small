# Obituary Notice for Carl W. Robbins III

August 10, 1981

Dear Editor,

I am writing to submit the following obituary notice for publication in tomorrow's edition of the Woburn Daily Times. Please include this in your obituary section.

**ROBBINS, Carl W. III** - Age 7, of 42 Maple Street, Woburn, passed away peacefully on August 9, 1981, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston after a courageous battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Carl was the beloved son of Carl W. Robbins Jr. and Donna (Sullivan) Robbins, and the cherished little brother of Susan Marie Robbins, age 12, and David Michael Robbins, age 9.

Born on March 15, 1974, in Woburn, Carl was a bright and spirited child who brought joy to everyone who knew him. He was a student at the Altavela Elementary School, where his teachers remember him as an eager learner with a particular love for drawing and storytelling. Carl enjoyed playing with his Matchbox cars, building elaborate cities with his Lego blocks, and spending time outdoors riding his bicycle around the neighborhood with his older siblings.

Carl was diagnosed with leukemia in September 1978, just after his fourth birthday. Throughout his three-year battle with this terrible disease, he showed remarkable courage and maintained his cheerful disposition, always managing to smile even during his most difficult treatments at the hospital. His family drew strength from his bravery, and his determination to keep playing and learning inspired everyone around him.

The Robbins family has lived at their Maple Street home since 1971, where Carl spent his entire life surrounded by the love of his parents and siblings. He was baptized at St. Charles Borromeo Church and was looking forward to making his First Holy Communion next spring. Carl loved attending Sunday services with his family and was known for his questions about everything he heard during Father McKenzie's sermons.

In addition to his parents and siblings, Carl is survived by his paternal grandparents, Carl W. Robbins Sr. and Mary (O'Brien) Robbins of Medford; his maternal grandparents, Patrick and Catherine Sullivan of Somerville; and numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins who adored him. He was predeceased by his maternal great-grandmother, Bridget Sullivan, whom he loved dearly and who used to tell him stories about Ireland.

Carl's favorite activities included helping his mother in the garden behind their house, where he took special pride in watering the tomato plants and picking vegetables for dinner. He also loved going to Woburn Common with his father to feed the ducks and play on the swings. During the winter months, Carl enjoyed sledding down the hill behind the elementary school and building snowmen in the backyard with Susan and David.

The family wishes to express their heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Patricia Coleman and the entire pediatric oncology staff at Massachusetts General Hospital for their compassionate care and dedication during Carl's illness. They also want to thank the many friends, neighbors, and members of St. Charles Borromeo parish who provided meals, transportation, and countless acts of kindness during this difficult time.

Visiting hours will be held at the Lynch-Cantillon Funeral Home, 263 Main Street, Woburn, on Tuesday, August 11, from 2:00 to 4:00 PM and 7:00 to 9:00 PM. A funeral Mass will be celebrated at St. Charles Borromeo Church, 280 Main Street, Woburn, on Wednesday, August 12, at 10:00 AM. Burial will follow at Woodbrook Cemetery in Woburn.

In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial donations be made to the Jimmy Fund at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, to support research into childhood leukemia and other pediatric cancers.

Carl's memory will live on in the hearts of all who knew and loved him. His laughter, his curiosity about the world around him, and his unwavering spirit in the face of adversity will never be forgotten. Though our hearts are broken, we find comfort in knowing that Carl is now at peace, free from pain and suffering.

"For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." - Romans 8:38-39
