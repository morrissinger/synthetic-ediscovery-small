# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Boston Globe Management  
**FROM:** Editorial Staff  
**DATE:** April 22, 1981  
**RE:** Editorial Meeting Notes - Woburn Environmental Story Coverage

## Meeting Summary

Following today's editorial board meeting, we are documenting our discussion regarding the developing environmental health story in Woburn, Massachusetts. The tragic death of twelve-year-old James Anderson on January 18 has brought significant attention to what appears to be a cluster of childhood leukemia cases in the East Woburn area, potentially linked to contaminated municipal water supplies from Wells G and H.

## Story Development Assessment

Our preliminary investigation suggests this story has substantial merit and warrants continued coverage. The Anderson family's situation presents a compelling human interest angle—Anne Anderson, a seventeen-year resident of 11 Orange Street, has lost her youngest son after a nine-year battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The family received water from the municipal wells throughout James's entire life, from prenatal development through his death at age twelve. Initial reports indicate the presence of industrial solvents, including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, in concentrations that far exceed safe drinking water standards.

The story involves multiple corporate entities with significant industrial operations in the Woburn area, including W.R. Grace Company, Cryovac Inc., Beatrice Foods, and John J. Riley Company. These companies have operated chemical processing and manufacturing facilities that may have contributed to groundwater contamination through improper disposal of toxic solvents. The EPA and Massachusetts Department of Public Health are conducting investigations, which provides official regulatory backing for our coverage.

## Editorial Position and Coverage Strategy

We recommend pursuing aggressive investigative reporting on this story while maintaining sensitivity to the affected families. The Anderson case appears to be part of a larger pattern—we have identified additional victims including Kevin Kane Jr., Michael Zona, Patrick Toomey, Carl Robbins III, and Roland Gamache, all young residents who have suffered from leukemia or other serious health conditions. This suggests a systematic environmental health crisis rather than isolated incidents.

Our coverage should focus on three primary angles: the human cost of industrial contamination, the failure of regulatory oversight that allowed dangerous chemicals to enter the municipal water supply, and the corporate responsibility of companies whose disposal practices may have caused this contamination. We should also examine the timeline of when Wells G and H became operational (1964 and 1966 respectively) and correlate this with the onset of health problems in the affected families.

## Recommendations for Continued Coverage

The editorial board recommends assigning our most experienced environmental reporters to develop this story comprehensively. We should coordinate with our investigative team to examine corporate records, EPA filings, and municipal water quality reports. Additionally, we should establish relationships with affected families, particularly Anne Anderson, who may serve as a primary source for understanding the community impact of this contamination.

This story has the potential to expose significant environmental justice issues and corporate accountability failures. We believe it deserves prominent placement and sustained coverage as developments unfold. The combination of childhood victims, corporate malfeasance, and regulatory failure creates a narrative that serves the public interest while maintaining our commitment to thorough, factual reporting.

We will continue monitoring developments and provide regular updates to management regarding story progression and resource allocation needs.
