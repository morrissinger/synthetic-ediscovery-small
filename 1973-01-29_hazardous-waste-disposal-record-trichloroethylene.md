## DISPOSAL METHODOLOGY

### Primary Disposal Method: On-Site Evaporation Lagoons
**Location:** Rear of manufacturing facility, approximately 200 feet southeast of main production building  
**Lagoon Specifications:**
- Lagoon #1: 40' x 60' x 8' depth, unlined earthen construction
- Lagoon #2: 35' x 50' x 6' depth, unlined earthen construction
- Total capacity: 1.2 million gallons combined

**Volume Disposed:** 2,245 gallons TCE waste  
**Disposal Period:** January 3-27, 1973  
**Method:** Direct discharge into lagoons for natural evaporation  
**Estimated Evaporation Rate:** 65-70% during January (cold weather conditions)  
**Residual Handling:** Remaining liquid allowed to percolate into subsoil

### Secondary Disposal Method: Drum Storage for Future Processing
**Volume:** 602 gallons  
**Container Type:** 55-gallon steel drums, DOT specification 17E  
**Storage Location:** Chemical storage building, Bay 3  
**Intended Disposition:** Transfer to off-site disposal contractor (scheduled February 1973)

## ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

### Groundwater Observations
**Monitoring Wells:** None currently installed at facility  
**Visual Inspections:** Monthly visual inspection of disposal area conducted January 15, 1973  
**Observations:** No visible surface contamination or unusual odors detected during inspection  
**Soil Conditions:** Frozen ground conditions limited detailed soil assessment

### Air Quality Assessment
**Monitoring Equipment:** None currently deployed  
**Subjective Observations:** Occasional chemical odors noted in disposal area during warmer days  
**Worker Exposure:** Standard safety protocols followed, including use of rubber gloves and adequate ventilation

---

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

### Massachusetts Department of Public Health Requirements
- **Applicable Regulations:** Chapter 111, Section 150A (Industrial Waste Disposal)
- **Permit Status:** Operating under general industrial permit issued June 1970
- **Reporting Requirements:** Annual summary report due March 31, 1973
- **Compliance Status:** Current disposal methods consistent with permit conditions

### Federal Guidelines
- **EPA Applicability:** Limited federal oversight at this time
- **Industry Standards:** Following Chemical Manufacturers Association recommended practices
- **Safety Protocols:** OSHA workplace safety standards implemented where applicable

## OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Short-term Actions (Next 30 Days)
1. **Drum Inventory:** Complete inventory of stored TCE waste drums and schedule removal
2. **Lagoon Maintenance:** Inspect lagoon berms for winter damage, repair as needed
3. **Documentation:** Maintain detailed logs of all disposal activities per company protocol

### Medium-term Considerations (Next 6 Months)
1. **Alternative Disposal:** Investigate contracted disposal services to reduce on-site storage
2. **Process Optimization:** Review manufacturing processes to minimize TCE waste generation
3. **Monitoring Enhancement:** Consider installation of groundwater monitoring wells if required by future regulations

### Long-term Planning (Next 12 Months)
1. **Regulatory Compliance:** Monitor evolving state and federal environmental regulations
2. **Technology Assessment:** Evaluate new disposal technologies as they become available
3. **Cost Analysis:** Conduct comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of disposal alternatives

## COST SUMMARY

**Direct Disposal Costs:**
- Lagoon maintenance and operation: $340.00
- Drum storage and handling: $180.00
- Labor costs (disposal operations): $520.00
- **Total Direct Costs:** $1,040.00

**Estimated Future Costs:**
- Off-site disposal of stored drums: $850.00 (estimated)
- Regulatory compliance activities: $200.00 (estimated)
