## DAILY PRODUCTION SHIFT REPORT
### WASTE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

**TO:** Frank J. Sullivan, Plant Manager

**RE:** Day Shift Production Summary and Waste Disposal Operations

## Production Summary - Day Shift (6:00 AM - 4:00 PM)

Production levels maintained normal capacity today with Line A through Line D operating at approximately 85% efficiency. Total polyethylene film output reached 12,400 pounds across all production lines. Quality control reported minimal defects with rejection rates holding steady at 2.3%, well within acceptable parameters.

The solvent recovery system experienced minor maintenance issues around 10:30 AM when the primary distillation unit required adjustment of temperature controls. Maintenance crew responded promptly and operations resumed within forty minutes. During this brief interruption, we diverted approximately 180 gallons of waste solvent mixture to temporary holding tanks as per standard protocol.

## Waste Management Operations

Per your directive regarding cost reduction measures, we continued implementation of the revised waste disposal procedures. Today's activities included the following:

**Liquid Waste Disposal:** Disposed of 320 gallons of mixed industrial solvents, primarily trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, along with smaller quantities of acetone and methyl ethyl ketone. The waste was transported to the rear disposal area behind Building C where it was discharged into the prepared trenches as directed. Weather conditions were favorable with minimal wind, which facilitated the operation.

**Solid Waste Management:** Removed 1,200 pounds of contaminated packaging materials, defective film products, and general manufacturing debris. Materials were sorted according to contamination levels, with heavily contaminated items directed to the burning area and remaining materials prepared for standard refuse collection.

The disposal trenches are performing adequately for liquid waste absorption. However, I note that recent rainfall has caused some pooling in the eastern section of the disposal area. The maintenance crew covered the affected area with additional soil and lime as a precautionary measure to control any potential odor issues.

## Personnel and Safety Notes

All personnel followed established safety protocols during waste handling operations. Personal protective equipment was utilized as required, including rubber gloves and safety goggles during solvent transfer operations. No incidents or injuries occurred during the shift.

I did receive one inquiry from a local resident who was walking along the perimeter fence around 2:15 PM. The individual, who identified himself as living on Salem Street, mentioned noticing an unusual odor in the area over the past several weeks. I assured him that all operations are conducted in accordance with company policy and suggested he contact the main office if he had specific concerns. The individual seemed satisfied with this response and continued on his way.

## Recommendations and Concerns

The current disposal methods are proving effective from an operational standpoint and are generating the cost savings you requested. However, I recommend we monitor the absorption capacity of the disposal trenches more closely, particularly during periods of heavy rainfall. The recent wet weather has highlighted some limitations in the current system's ability to handle large volumes of liquid waste during adverse conditions.

Additionally, I suggest we consider expanding the disposal area to provide additional capacity for future operations. The current trenches are approaching their optimal capacity, and expanding our disposal capabilities would provide operational flexibility while maintaining the cost efficiencies achieved through our current methods.

## Action Items for Tomorrow's Shift

1. Continue monitoring of trench absorption rates following weekend rainfall
2. Complete maintenance inspection of solvent recovery system
3. Coordinate with maintenance crew regarding lime application schedule
4. Review inventory levels of protective equipment for waste handling operations

Please let me know if you require any additional information regarding today's operations or if you would like to discuss any modifications to current procedures.
