# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** W.R. Grace Operations Division  
**FROM:** Robert H. Mitchell, Construction Manager  
**DATE:** August 14, 1960  
**RE:** Construction Commencement Notice - Cryovac Manufacturing Facility, East Woburn

## Project Initiation

This memorandum serves as formal notification that construction activities for the new Cryovac manufacturing facility in East Woburn, Massachusetts will commence on Monday, August 22, 1960. The site preparation phase has been completed, and all necessary permits have been secured from the City of Woburn Planning Department and the Massachusetts Department of Public Works.

The facility will be constructed on a 15.2-acre parcel located at 254 Salem Street, directly adjacent to the existing John J. Riley tannery operations. The property selection committee determined this location optimal due to its proximity to established industrial infrastructure, including direct railroad access via the Boston & Maine Railroad spur line, and adequate water table access for manufacturing processes. The site offers strategic advantages for our expanding Cryovac division, particularly given the projected growth in food packaging applications throughout the New England market.

## Construction Specifications and Timeline

Barton & Associates Construction Company of Cambridge has been awarded the primary construction contract, with an estimated completion date of March 15, 1961. The facility design encompasses 47,500 square feet of manufacturing space, including specialized areas for polyethylene film production, vacuum packaging equipment assembly, and chemical storage. Engineering specifications call for reinforced concrete foundation systems extending 8 feet below grade level, with integrated drainage systems to accommodate manufacturing waste disposal requirements.

The construction timeline includes excavation and foundation work through October 1960, structural steel installation from November through January 1961, and interior finishing from February through March 1961. Manufacturing equipment installation is scheduled to begin in April 1961, with full production capacity anticipated by June 1961. Barton & Associates has confirmed adequate availability of skilled labor and materials to maintain this aggressive schedule.

## Operational Planning Considerations

Manufacturing operations will focus primarily on Cryovac's proprietary shrink-wrap packaging materials, utilizing advanced polyethylene processing techniques developed at our research facilities in Cambridge. The East Woburn location will serve as our primary New England production center, with initial capacity projections of 2.3 million pounds of packaging film annually. Raw material requirements include polyethylene resins, various chemical solvents for cleaning and preparation processes, and specialized additives for film enhancement properties.

The facility design incorporates standard industrial waste management systems, including underground storage tanks for chemical solvents and process cleaning agents. Waste disposal protocols will follow established W.R. Grace procedures for chemical manufacturing operations, with liquid waste materials directed to on-site disposal areas consistent with current industry practices. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has reviewed our operational plans and confirmed compliance with existing industrial waste regulations.

## Coordination with Existing Operations

Construction activities have been coordinated with the adjacent Riley tannery to minimize disruption to their ongoing leather processing operations. John J. Riley has expressed full cooperation with our construction schedule and has agreed to temporary modifications to his truck delivery routes during peak construction periods. The shared industrial nature of the Salem Street corridor provides excellent synergy for both manufacturing operations.

Local utility connections are being established through Massachusetts Electric Company and New England Telephone & Telegraph Company, with service installations scheduled for completion by February 1961. Water supply requirements will be met through direct connection to the Woburn municipal system, supplemented by on-site wells if necessary to meet peak manufacturing demands.

Please ensure that all relevant department heads receive copies of this memorandum and coordinate with their respective teams regarding the transition timeline for Cryovac operations. I will provide weekly construction progress reports beginning August 29, 1960.
