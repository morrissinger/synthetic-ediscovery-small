## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Beatrice Foods Inc., a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 2 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois, hereby submits this formal response to the City of Woburn's inquiry dated June 5, 1979, regarding potential groundwater contamination in the vicinity of municipal Wells G and H. This submission addresses the specific information requests contained in your correspondence and provides comprehensive documentation of our subsidiary operations' environmental compliance practices.

## CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND PROPERTY OWNERSHIP

Beatrice Foods Inc. confirms ownership of the John J. Riley Company tannery facility located at 228 Salem Street, Woburn, Massachusetts, and an adjacent 14.73-acre undeveloped parcel. The Riley tannery operation was acquired by Beatrice Foods through corporate acquisition in 1968 and has operated continuously as a leather processing facility serving the New England industrial market.

The Riley tannery facility consists of:
- Primary tanning building (approximately 45,000 square feet)
- Chemical storage warehouse (8,500 square feet)
- Administrative offices (2,200 square feet)
- Loading dock and shipping facilities
- Employee parking areas
- Undeveloped buffer land

## OPERATIONAL HISTORY AND CHEMICAL USAGE

### Historical Operations (1968-1979)

The John J. Riley Company has operated as a commercial leather tanning facility since 1952, with Beatrice Foods assuming operational control in 1968. The facility processes approximately 2,500 hides per month using standard industry tanning methods and chemicals. Our records indicate consistent compliance with all applicable federal and state environmental regulations throughout the period of Beatrice ownership.

### Chemical Inventory and Storage

The Riley tannery utilizes the following chemicals in standard leather processing operations:

**Primary Tanning Chemicals:**
- Chromium sulfate (Cr₂(SO₄)₃) - 15,000 pounds monthly average
- Sodium chloride (NaCl) - 8,200 pounds monthly average
- Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) - 2,100 gallons monthly average
- Formic acid (HCOOH) - 850 gallons monthly average

**Auxiliary Processing Chemicals:**
- Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) - 1,200 pounds monthly average
- Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂) - 900 pounds monthly average
- Various organic dyes and finishing compounds

**Storage and Handling Protocols:**
All chemicals are stored in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations and industry best practices. Chemical storage areas feature concrete containment systems, proper ventilation, and spill response equipment. Monthly inventory audits ensure accurate tracking of chemical usage and waste generation.

## WASTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

### Solid Waste Disposal

Solid waste materials from tanning operations, including hair, flesh, and trimmed hide materials, are collected by licensed waste management contractors for disposal at approved facilities. Records of waste manifests and disposal receipts are maintained for regulatory compliance purposes.

### Liquid Waste Management

Process wastewater from tanning operations undergoes primary treatment in on-site settling ponds before discharge to the municipal sewer system under permit issued by the Woburn Department of Public Works. Discharge monitoring reports are filed quarterly with city officials as required.

### Historical Waste Disposal (1952-1968)

Prior to Beatrice Foods ownership, waste disposal practices at the Riley facility followed industry standards of the period. Historical records indicate that some liquid wastes may have been disposed of on the undeveloped portions of the property through land application methods common to the leather industry during the 1950s and 1960s.

## ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE RECORD

Beatrice Foods maintains comprehensive environmental compliance documentation for all subsidiary operations. The Riley tannery facility has operated under the following permits and authorizations:

- **Massachusetts Department of Public Health Operating Permit** (Renewed annually)
- **Woburn Department of Public Works Sewer Discharge Permit** (Permit #WB-IND-68-014)
- **Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Air Emissions Authorization**

No violations of environmental regulations have been recorded against the Riley facility during the period of Beatrice Foods ownership (1968-1979).

## GROUNDWATER MONITORING AND TESTING

### Current Monitoring Program

In response to industry best practices and regulatory guidance, Beatrice Foods initiated voluntary groundwater monitoring at the Riley facility in March 1979. Three monitoring wells were installed on the property perimeter to assess potential impacts from historical operations.

**Monitoring Well Locations:**
- **MW-1:** Northeast property boundary (upgradient)
- **MW-2:** Southeast property boundary (downgradient toward Wells G and H)
- **MW-3:** Southwest property boundary (downgradient toward Aberjona River)

### Testing Results Summary

Quarterly groundwater samples collected from March through June 1979 indicate the following conditions:

**MW-1 (Upgradient Control):**
- pH: 6.8-7.2
- Total dissolved solids: 320-380 mg/L
- Chromium (total): <0.05 mg/L
- Volatile organic compounds: Not detected

**MW-2 (Downgradient - Wells G&H Direction):**
- pH: 6.9-7.4
- Total dissolved solids: 340-420 mg/L
- Chromium (total): 0.08-0.12 mg/L
- Trichloroethylene: <0.001 mg/L
- Tetrachloroethylene: <0.001 mg/L

**MW-3 (Downgradient - River Direction):**
- pH: 7.1-7.6
- Total dissolved solids: 310-390 mg/L
- Chromium (total): 0.06-0.09 mg/L
- Volatile organic compounds: Not detected

## ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS

### Hydrogeological Considerations

Professional hydrogeological assessment of the Riley facility indicates groundwater flow direction from northwest to southeast, generally consistent with the regional gradient toward the Aberjona River. The facility is located approximately 1,200 feet southwest of municipal Wells G and H, with intervening geological formations that may influence contaminant migration patterns.

### Chemical Migration Analysis

Based on available data and professional hydrogeological analysis, the potential for chemical migration from the Riley facility to Wells G and H appears limited by:

1. **Distance and Flow Direction:** Significant separation distance and oblique groundwater flow patterns
2. **Geological Barriers:** Intervening clay and silt layers that may retard contaminant migration
3. **Chemical Properties:** Low mobility characteristics of chromium compounds in typical soil conditions
4. **Monitoring Results:** Minimal detection of target compounds in downgradient monitoring wells

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE COMMITMENT

Beatrice Foods reaffirms its commitment to full compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and cooperative participation in ongoing investigations. The company will continue quarterly groundwater monitoring and reporting to appropriate regulatory authorities.

### Proposed Additional Measures

In the interest of community health protection and environmental stewardship, Beatrice Foods proposes the following additional measures:

1. **Expanded Monitoring Program:** Installation of additional monitoring wells to provide comprehensive groundwater assessment
2. **Enhanced Testing Protocol:** Monthly sampling for expanded analytical parameters including volatile organic compounds
3. **Historical Investigation:** Comprehensive review of pre-1968 operational records and disposal practices
4. **Remediation Planning:** Development of corrective action plans if monitoring indicates environmental impacts

## LEGAL POSITION AND LIMITATIONS

This submission is provided in response to the City of Woburn's information request and in the interest of cooperative environmental investigation. Beatrice Foods reserves all legal rights and defenses, and this submission should not be construed as an admission of liability or responsibility for any alleged environmental contamination.
