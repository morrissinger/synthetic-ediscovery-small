## PROCUREMENT JUSTIFICATION

**Business Need:** These industrial solvents and treatment compounds are required for ongoing degreasing operations in our precision manufacturing processes. The trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene will be utilized primarily in our vapor degreasing units for cleaning metal components prior to assembly. The 1,1,1-trichloroethane serves as our primary cold cleaning solvent for smaller parts and equipment maintenance.

**Usage Projections:** Based on current production schedules and historical consumption data, these quantities represent approximately 4-6 months of normal operations. The methylene chloride and ketone solvents are essential for our specialty coating removal processes, while the Freon-113 is required for precision electronic component cleaning in our instrument division.

**Storage and Handling:** All chemical materials will be stored in designated areas within Buildings 2 and 3, in compliance with company safety protocols. Our maintenance staff has been trained in proper handling procedures, and we maintain current safety data sheets for all purchased chemicals. Waste solvents from operations are collected and disposed of through our established waste management contractor, Yankee Environmental Services.

**Budget Allocation:** Total procurement value of $10,511.00 falls within approved Q4 1971 chemical purchasing budget of $45,000. These purchases represent essential materials for maintaining production schedules through the first quarter of 1972.

**Environmental Considerations:** Company policy requires all chemical waste to be properly containerized and removed from the premises by licensed waste disposal contractors. Used solvents are not to be discharged to sanitary sewers or storm drains under any circumstances, in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines.
