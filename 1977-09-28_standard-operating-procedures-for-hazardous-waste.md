# BEATRICE FOODS CORPORATION
## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE OBSERVATION

**TO:** All Tannery Personnel  
**FROM:** Safety Department, Beatrice Foods Corporation  
**DATE:** September 28, 1977  
**RE:** Implementation of Hazardous Waste Observation Protocols

---

## PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes mandatory protocols for the observation, documentation, and reporting of hazardous waste materials at the Beatrice Foods tannery facility located at 15 Olympia Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts. All personnel involved in tannery operations, including but not limited to production supervisors, maintenance staff, quality control inspectors, and general laborers, must comply with these procedures effective October 1, 1977.

The implementation of these protocols responds to recent regulatory guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering and aligns with corporate risk management objectives. These procedures shall be considered minimum standards and may be supplemented by additional safety measures as deemed necessary by facility management.

## HAZARDOUS WASTE IDENTIFICATION

Personnel must maintain awareness of the following categories of hazardous materials commonly present in tannery operations:

### Chemical Solvents
- Trichloroethylene (TCE) used in degreasing operations
- Perchloroethylene (PCE) utilized in cleaning processes
- Methylene chloride employed in various finishing applications
- Carbon tetrachloride present in certain specialty treatments

### Heavy Metal Compounds
- Chromium-based tanning agents
- Lead-containing dyes and pigments
- Mercury compounds in preservation solutions
- Arsenic-based biocides and fungicides

### Organic Waste Products
- Animal hide remnants and processing byproducts
- Contaminated leather scraps containing chemical residues
- Spent process solutions with elevated pH levels
- Biological waste materials from hide preparation

## OBSERVATION PROTOCOLS

### Daily Visual Inspections

All personnel must conduct visual inspections of their assigned work areas at the beginning of each shift and document observations using Form BF-HW-001 (Hazardous Waste Observation Log). Specific attention shall be directed to:

1. **Container Integrity**: Examine all drums, tanks, and storage vessels for signs of corrosion, leakage, or structural compromise. Any container showing visible damage must be reported immediately to the shift supervisor.

2. **Spill Detection**: Monitor floor areas, drainage systems, and equipment surfaces for evidence of chemical spills or unusual discoloration. Particular attention must be paid to areas surrounding solvent storage tanks and chemical mixing stations.

3. **Vapor Emissions**: Note any unusual odors, visible vapors, or atmospheric conditions that may indicate chemical releases. Personnel experiencing respiratory irritation or unusual symptoms must report these conditions immediately.

4. **Waste Accumulation**: Document the location and approximate volume of hazardous waste materials awaiting disposal, including contaminated equipment, spent chemicals, and process byproducts.

### Weekly Comprehensive Assessments

Each Wednesday, designated personnel from each department must conduct comprehensive hazardous waste assessments covering:

- **Inventory Verification**: Reconcile chemical usage records with remaining inventory to identify potential losses or unaccounted materials
- **Storage Compliance**: Ensure all hazardous materials remain in designated storage areas with appropriate labeling and containment measures
- **Equipment Condition**: Evaluate the operational status of waste handling equipment, including pumps, conveyor systems, and containment structures
- **Documentation Review**: Verify completion of daily observation logs and identify any patterns or recurring issues requiring management attention

## DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Immediate Reporting

Any observation of the following conditions requires immediate notification of the shift supervisor and completion of Form BF-HW-002 (Incident Report):

- Visible chemical spills exceeding one gallon in volume
- Container failures resulting in material release
- Equipment malfunctions affecting waste containment systems
- Personnel exposure incidents involving direct contact with hazardous materials
- Detection of unusual odors or atmospheric conditions in work areas

### Record Maintenance

All hazardous waste observation documentation must be maintained in accordance with the following standards:

1. **Daily Logs**: Retain on-site for minimum of three years, with copies forwarded monthly to corporate safety department
2. **Incident Reports**: Submit to facility management within 24 hours, with copies maintained permanently in personnel safety files
3. **Weekly Assessments**: File with monthly operational reports and maintain for minimum of five years
4. **Training Records**: Document all personnel training related to hazardous waste observation and maintain in individual employee files

## TRAINING AND COMPETENCY

### Initial Training Requirements

All personnel subject to these procedures must complete hazardous waste observation training within thirty days of this SOP implementation. Training curriculum includes:

- Recognition of common hazardous materials used in tannery operations
- Proper completion of observation documentation
- Emergency response procedures for chemical spills and exposures
- Personal protective equipment requirements and limitations
- Regulatory compliance obligations and reporting procedures

### Ongoing Education

Quarterly refresher training sessions will address updates to procedures, lessons learned from incident investigations, and regulatory developments affecting hazardous waste management. Attendance at these sessions is mandatory for all covered personnel.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

### Supervisor Verification

Department supervisors must review all hazardous waste observation documentation weekly and verify compliance with established procedures. Any deficiencies in documentation or procedural adherence must be addressed through corrective action and additional training as necessary.

### Management Review

Facility management will conduct monthly reviews of hazardous waste observation data to identify trends, evaluate procedural effectiveness, and implement improvements as warranted. These reviews will consider both operational efficiency and regulatory compliance requirements.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

These procedures support compliance with applicable federal and state regulations governing hazardous waste management, including but not limited to:

- Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements for waste identification and management
- Massachusetts Hazardous Waste Management Act provisions for industrial facilities
- Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for workplace chemical exposure
- Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for industrial waste handling

Failure to comply with these procedures may result in regulatory violations, financial penalties, and potential legal liability for the corporation and individual personnel.

## IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE

- **October 1, 1977**: Mandatory compliance date for all procedures
- **October 15, 1977**: Completion deadline for initial personnel training
- **November 1, 1977**: First monthly management review of observation data
- **January 1, 1978**: First quarterly refresher training session
