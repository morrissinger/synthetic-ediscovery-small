### CHIEF COMPLAINT
Patient presents with mother reporting continued fatigue, intermittent fever, and new onset of petechial rash on lower extremities. Mother states symptoms have persisted for approximately three weeks despite previous antibiotic treatment.

### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
James is a 13-year-old male who was previously seen in our emergency department on April 18, 1980, for complaints of persistent fatigue and low-grade fever. At that time, he was diagnosed with probable viral syndrome and discharged home with supportive care recommendations. Mother reports that symptoms have not resolved and have actually worsened over the past week.

Patient now complains of:
- Severe fatigue limiting normal activities
- Intermittent fevers ranging from 100.2°F to 102.8°F
- Loss of appetite with 8-pound weight loss over past month
- New onset of small red spots on legs (petechiae)
- Occasional nosebleeds
- Generalized weakness
- Difficulty concentrating in school

Mother reports that James has been unable to participate in his usual activities including baseball practice and has been sleeping 12-14 hours per day. She notes that several other children in their East Woburn neighborhood have been experiencing similar symptoms, which prompted her to bring James back for further evaluation.

### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
- Born full-term, normal delivery
- Childhood immunizations up to date
- No significant past illnesses
- No known allergies
- No previous hospitalizations
- Lives in East Woburn, family has resided at current address since 1965

- Height: 5'2"

**General Appearance:** Pale, thin male appearing chronically ill and fatigued. Alert but lethargic.

**HEENT:** Pale conjunctiva, no scleral icterus. Oral mucosa pale with small petechial lesions on soft palate. No lymphadenopathy palpable in neck.

**Cardiovascular:** Tachycardic, regular rhythm. Grade II/VI systolic murmur heard best at left sternal border, consistent with flow murmur secondary to anemia.

**Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or rales.

**Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender. Spleen palpable 2 cm below left costal margin. Liver edge palpable 1 cm below right costal margin.

**Extremities:** Multiple petechial lesions noted on bilateral lower extremities, particularly around ankles. No edema. No joint swelling or tenderness.

**Skin:** Pallor noted throughout. Scattered petechiae as noted above. No jaundice.

### LABORATORY RESULTS
Blood drawn at 11:15 AM for complete blood count with differential:

**Complete Blood Count:**
- White Blood Cell Count: 2,800/μL (Normal: 4,500-13,500)
- Red Blood Cell Count: 2.1 million/μL (Normal: 4.0-5.2 million)
- Hemoglobin: 6.8 g/dL (Normal: 11.5-15.5)
- Hematocrit: 20.1% (Normal: 34-46%)
- Platelet Count: 28,000/μL (Normal: 150,000-450,000)
- Mean Corpuscular Volume: 95 fL (Normal: 80-100)

**Differential:**
- Neutrophils: 45%
- Lymphocytes: 40%
- Monocytes: 10%
- Eosinophils: 3%
- Basophils: 2%
- **Blast cells present: 15% (ABNORMAL)**

**Blood Chemistry:**
- Glucose: 88 mg/dL
- BUN: 18 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
- LDH: 485 U/L (Elevated)

### ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

**Primary Diagnosis:** Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) - highly suspected based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings

**Secondary Diagnoses:**
- Severe anemia
- Thrombocytopenia
- Neutropenia

The constellation of symptoms including fatigue, fever, weight loss, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, and the laboratory findings of pancytopenia with circulating blast cells is highly concerning for acute leukemia. The patient requires immediate hematologic evaluation and bone marrow biopsy for definitive diagnosis.

**Immediate Management:**
1. **Urgent referral** to Children's Hospital Boston Hematology/Oncology service
2. **Admission** recommended for further workup and initiation of treatment
3. **Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy** to be performed within 24 hours
4. **Blood transfusion** - 2 units packed red blood cells to be administered today
5. **Platelet transfusion** - 6 units platelets given low platelet count and bleeding risk
6. **Isolation precautions** due to neutropenia and infection risk

**Patient Education and Family Discussion:**
Extensive discussion held with mother Anne Anderson regarding preliminary findings and urgent need for specialized care. Mother was informed that the blood work results are very concerning and consistent with a serious blood disorder that requires immediate treatment at a specialized children's hospital. She was advised that James should not return to school and should avoid contact with sick individuals due to his compromised immune system.

Mother expressed significant concern and asked multiple questions about potential causes. She mentioned that several other children in their East Woburn neighborhood have been diagnosed with similar blood disorders over the past year, including Kevin Kane Jr. and Michael Zona. She specifically asked if there could be an environmental cause, mentioning that their drinking water had "tasted funny" for several years.

**Social Services Consultation:** Given the serious nature of diagnosis and family's financial concerns about treatment costs, social services consultation arranged to assist with insurance coordination and transportation to Children's Hospital Boston.

**Pain Assessment:** Patient reports generalized body aches and fatigue but denies severe pain at this time. Pain scale assessment 3/10. Mother reports James has been experiencing headaches and bone pain, particularly in legs, over past two weeks. This pain has interfered with his sleep and daily activities, causing him significant distress and limiting his ability to participate in normal childhood activities.

**Follow-up:**
- **Immediate transfer** to Children's Hospital Boston arranged via ambulance
- Dr. Patricia Williams at Children's Hospital Hematology/Oncology contacted and expecting patient
- Copy of all records and laboratory results to accompany patient
- Mother provided with contact information and directions

**Prognosis Discussion:** Given the young age of patient and if confirmed diagnosis of ALL, treatment options are available, though the road ahead will be challenging. Survival rates for pediatric ALL have improved significantly with current treatment protocols, but immediate aggressive treatment is essential.
