# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Riley Company Operations Manager  
**FROM:** John J. Riley, President  
**DATE:** December 7, 1970  
**RE:** Authorization for Continued Riverside Waste Storage Operations

This memo serves to confirm authorization for continued storage and disposal operations at our riverside facility, effective immediately through the end of fiscal year 1971. Following our discussion last week regarding the expansion of our chemical processing operations, I am directing that we proceed with current waste management protocols while implementing the cost-saving measures we discussed.

The recent increase in production volume from our industrial clients, particularly the expanded contracts with local manufacturing facilities, has resulted in substantially higher volumes of waste solvents and chemical byproducts requiring disposal. Our current riverside storage area has proven adequate for handling these increased volumes, and the proximity to the Aberjona River continues to provide convenient access for our disposal trucks. The location remains optimal for our operations, as it allows for efficient processing of materials while maintaining reasonable distance from the main facility buildings.

I am authorizing the continued use of the existing storage pits and lagoons for liquid waste materials, including trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and other industrial solvents that comprise the majority of our waste stream. The current practice of allowing natural percolation and evaporation has proven cost-effective and should be maintained. Any concerns regarding groundwater in the area should be considered secondary to operational efficiency, as our primary responsibility is to our clients and shareholders. The Massachusetts environmental regulations remain minimal in this area, and we should take advantage of this regulatory environment while it exists.

Effective with this authorization, I am also approving the expansion of storage capacity through the excavation of additional disposal areas as needed. The operations manager is hereby authorized to contract for earthmoving services to create new lagoons or expand existing ones without requiring additional approval from this office, provided that costs remain within the established budget parameters. All disposal activities should continue to be conducted with appropriate discretion, and detailed records of waste volumes and types should be maintained in our internal files only.

**John J. Riley**
