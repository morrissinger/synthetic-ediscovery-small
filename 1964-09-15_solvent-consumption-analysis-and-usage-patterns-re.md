# SOLVENT CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS AND USAGE PATTERNS REPORT

**Prepared by:** Environmental Coordinator, Cryovac Division  
**Prepared for:** W.R. Grace Company Safety Department  
**Date:** September 15, 1964  
**Report Number:** CRY-ENV-64-037

## ABSTRACT

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of solvent consumption patterns and usage at the Cryovac manufacturing facility in Woburn, Massachusetts for the period January 1964 through August 1964. The analysis examines consumption rates of primary solvents including trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and related cleaning compounds utilized in the plastic film manufacturing process. Data indicates increasing solvent requirements correlating with expanded production capacity and identifies areas for potential efficiency improvements.

## INTRODUCTION

The Cryovac Division of W.R. Grace Company has experienced significant growth in production volume during 1964, necessitating increased utilization of industrial solvents for equipment cleaning and degreasing operations. This analysis was commissioned to evaluate current consumption patterns, identify trends, and assess the adequacy of existing solvent management procedures to support continued operational expansion.

The Woburn facility, located at 201 Merrimac Street in East Woburn, operates continuous production lines for plastic film manufacturing, requiring regular cleaning cycles to maintain product quality standards. Solvent usage occurs primarily in three operational areas: equipment degreasing, parts cleaning, and maintenance operations.

## METHODOLOGY

Data collection encompassed inventory records, purchase orders, and production logs maintained by the Plant Operations Department. Consumption figures were cross-referenced with production output data to establish usage ratios and identify operational efficiency metrics. Monthly consumption patterns were analyzed to identify seasonal variations and correlate usage with production schedules.

Solvent storage and handling procedures were reviewed in consultation with Plant Maintenance and Safety personnel. Current disposal methods were documented through interviews with facility management and review of waste handling protocols.

## FINDINGS

### Primary Solvent Consumption (January - August 1964)

**Trichloroethylene (TCE):**
- Total consumption: 18,450 gallons
- Average monthly usage: 2,306 gallons
- Peak consumption: March 1964 (2,890 gallons)
- Primary applications: Equipment degreasing, parts cleaning

**Perchloroethylene (PCE):**
- Total consumption: 12,330 gallons
- Average monthly usage: 1,541 gallons
- Peak consumption: July 1964 (1,825 gallons)
- Primary applications: Precision cleaning operations

**Mixed Chlorinated Solvents:**
- Total consumption: 6,780 gallons
- Average monthly usage: 848 gallons
- Applications: General maintenance cleaning

### Usage Patterns and Trends

Analysis reveals a 23% increase in total solvent consumption compared to the corresponding period in 1963, directly correlating with the 19% increase in production output. The consumption-to-production ratio has increased slightly, indicating potential areas for efficiency improvement.

Monthly consumption patterns show peaks during March and July, corresponding to scheduled maintenance periods and increased production demands. The facility's expansion of operations to include additional production lines has necessitated proportional increases in cleaning solvent requirements.

### Storage and Handling Procedures

Current solvent inventory is maintained in above-ground storage tanks located in the northeastern section of the facility property. Primary storage consists of:
- Two 5,000-gallon TCE storage tanks
- One 3,000-gallon PCE storage tank
- Multiple 55-gallon drums for specialty solvents

Storage areas are equipped with containment berms and drainage systems designed to manage potential spills. However, inspection reveals several areas where containment integrity may be compromised, particularly around older drum storage areas where concrete surfaces show signs of deterioration.

### Waste Solvent Management

Spent solvents are currently managed through multiple disposal methods:
- Distillation recovery for high-grade solvents (approximately 35% of total volume)
- Off-site disposal through licensed contractors (40% of total volume)
- On-site disposal in designated areas (25% of total volume)

On-site disposal practices include discharge to unlined lagoons located in the rear portion of the facility property, adjacent to wetland areas that connect to the Aberjona River watershed. These lagoons receive approximately 1,200 gallons of spent solvent monthly, primarily consisting of TCE and PCE mixtures with water and particulate matter.

### Environmental Considerations

The facility's location within the Aberjona River watershed requires careful consideration of solvent management practices. Soil conditions in the area consist primarily of sandy loam with high permeability, potentially allowing rapid migration of spilled or disposed materials toward groundwater resources.

Recent municipal water supply expansion in East Woburn, including the opening of Well G in early 1964, has increased the importance of maintaining appropriate environmental safeguards. The well's proximity to industrial operations in the area necessitates enhanced attention to potential groundwater protection measures.

## CONCLUSIONS

Current solvent consumption patterns reflect normal operational requirements for expanded production capacity. The observed increase in usage is proportional to production growth and falls within expected parameters for similar manufacturing operations.

Existing storage and handling procedures generally conform to current industry standards, though several areas have been identified where improvements could enhance operational safety and environmental protection. The facility's waste solvent management practices require evaluation to ensure continued compliance with evolving regulatory expectations.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (30 days)
1. **Containment System Inspection:** Conduct comprehensive evaluation of all solvent storage containment systems, with particular attention to concrete integrity around drum storage areas.

2. **Disposal Practice Review:** Evaluate current on-site disposal methods in light of expanding municipal water supply operations in the vicinity.

3. **Inventory Management:** Implement enhanced inventory tracking systems to optimize solvent purchasing and minimize waste generation.

### Medium-term Improvements (90 days)
1. **Recovery System Enhancement:** Investigate expanded distillation capacity to increase solvent recovery rates and reduce disposal requirements.

2. **Alternative Disposal Methods:** Evaluate additional off-site disposal options to reduce reliance on on-site lagoon systems.

3. **Personnel Training:** Implement enhanced training programs for personnel involved in solvent handling and disposal operations.

### Long-term Considerations (12 months)
1. **Process Optimization:** Conduct comprehensive review of cleaning procedures to identify opportunities for reduced solvent consumption while maintaining quality standards.

2. **Facility Upgrades:** Consider infrastructure improvements to enhance environmental protection capabilities, particularly in waste management areas.

3. **Regulatory Compliance:** Monitor evolving environmental regulations and adjust operational procedures as necessary to maintain compliance.

The continued growth of Cryovac operations necessitates proactive management of solvent usage and disposal practices. Implementation of these recommendations will support operational efficiency while maintaining appropriate environmental stewardship consistent with W.R. Grace Company's commitment to responsible manufacturing practices.
