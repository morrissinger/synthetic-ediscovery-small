# October 11, 1977

Tuesday afternoon, after lunch

Had the whole family together for Sunday dinner this past weekend, which doesn't happen as often as it used to. Pat's been working extra shifts at the plant, and with the older kids having their own schedules now, it's harder to coordinate. But Sunday we managed to get everyone around the table at the same time.

Made a pot roast with potatoes and carrots - Michael always loved that meal. I still find myself setting an extra place sometimes, or buying too much milk at the grocery store. It's been three and a half years now since we lost him, but these little habits die hard. The empty chair at the dinner table still catches my eye, especially when we're all gathered together like that.

Susan brought her boyfriend over to meet everyone properly. He seems like a nice enough young man, works at the garage on Main Street. She's been talking about him for months, so it was good to finally put a face to the name. Pat was his usual gruff self at first, asking all sorts of questions about the boy's family and his intentions. But by the end of the meal they were talking about the Red Sox and getting along fine.

The younger ones are doing well in school this fall. Tommy's in his senior year now and talking about maybe going to community college next year, though the money situation is still tight. All those medical bills from Michael's treatment really set us back, and we're still paying some of them off. The insurance covered most of it, but there were so many things that weren't covered - the special foods the doctor recommended, the extra trips to Boston when he had to stay overnight, the time I had to take off work to care for him.

I've been thinking more about the other families in the neighborhood lately. The Andersons lost their Jimmy just last year, and I see Anne at the grocery store sometimes. We don't talk about it directly, but there's an understanding between us that other people don't have. You can see it in her eyes - that same exhaustion and grief that I recognize from my own mirror. She looks older now, like we all do.

Mrs. Kane down the street mentioned that her Kevin hasn't been feeling well lately. He's been tired a lot, she says, and bruising easily. It reminded me so much of how Michael was in those early weeks before we knew what was wrong. I wanted to tell her to take him to the doctor right away, but I didn't want to frighten her. Maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's just a phase that kids go through.

The water from the tap has been tasting funny again lately. Pat says I'm imagining things, but I swear there's a chemical taste to it sometimes, especially in the morning. I've started buying bottled water for drinking, though Pat thinks it's a waste of money. He says the city water is fine, that they test it all the time. But after everything we've been through, I'd rather be safe than sorry.

Been doing some cleaning in Michael's room this week. I've been putting it off for too long, but Pat says we need to think about using that space for something else. Found his collection of baseball cards in the closet, and his glove that he was so proud of. He was going to try out for Little League the spring after he got sick. Had it all planned out - said he was going to practice every day in the backyard until he made the team.

The neighborhood feels different now than it did when we first moved here. There used to be more children playing outside, riding bikes up and down Montvale Road. Now it's quieter. Some families have moved away, and others keep their kids inside more. Mrs. Toomey told me last week that they're thinking about looking for a house in a different part of town. Her Patrick has been having health problems too, and the doctor can't seem to figure out what's causing them.

I've been having trouble sleeping again lately. Keep thinking about all the what-ifs. What if we had moved somewhere else when Pat first got his job? What if I had insisted on taking Michael to the doctor sooner when he first started getting tired? What if there was something in the environment here that made him sick? The doctors never could give us a clear answer about why he got leukemia. They said it just happens sometimes, that there's no way to prevent it or predict it.

Pat doesn't like it when I talk about these things. He says we can't change what happened, and dwelling on it won't bring Michael back. He's right, of course, but a mother can't help but wonder. Especially when you hear about other children in the same neighborhood getting sick with the same disease.

Tomorrow I need to go to the bank to make a payment on the medical bills, and then stop by the school to pick up Tommy's report card. Life keeps moving forward, even when part of your heart is stuck in the past. That's what I've learned these past few years - you don't get over losing a child, you just learn to carry the weight of it differently.

The leaves are turning beautiful colors this fall. Michael always loved autumn - said it was like the whole world was putting on a show just for him. I try to notice these things now, the way he would have. Try to see the beauty he would have seen, if he had been given more time to see it.
