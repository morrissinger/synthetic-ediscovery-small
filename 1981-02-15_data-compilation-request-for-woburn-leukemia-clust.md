# CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL
## ATLANTA, GEORGIA 30333

**MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR**
**MASSACHUSETTS CANCER REGISTRY**

**FROM:** Dr. Robert Chen, M.D., M.P.H.  
**Chief, Environmental Epidemiology Section**  
**Division of Environmental Health**  
**Centers for Disease Control**

**DATE:** February 15, 1981

**SUBJECT:** Urgent Data Compilation Request - Woburn, Massachusetts Childhood Leukemia Cluster Investigation

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Centers for Disease Control hereby formally requests comprehensive cancer incidence data from the Massachusetts Cancer Registry to support an ongoing epidemiological investigation into a suspected childhood leukemia cluster in Woburn, Massachusetts. This request is made pursuant to our statutory authority under the Public Health Service Act and in response to mounting concerns regarding an apparent excess of childhood leukemia cases in the East Woburn area, particularly among families served by municipal Wells G and H.

## BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION

Recent preliminary investigations have identified a statistically significant cluster of childhood leukemia cases in Woburn, Massachusetts, with particular concentration in the East Woburn residential area. Of immediate concern is the temporal correlation between the opening of municipal Wells G and H (1964 and 1966 respectively) and the subsequent increase in pediatric leukemia diagnoses among children whose families resided within the wells' service area.

The death of James Anderson on January 18, 1981, at age twelve, has brought urgent attention to this matter. James Anderson, residing at 11 Orange Street with his mother Anne Anderson since 1964, was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in January 1972 at age three. His family had consumed water exclusively from the municipal system supplied by Wells G and H throughout his prenatal development, infancy, and childhood. This case, while tragic in its individual circumstances, represents a pattern that demands immediate scientific investigation.

## SPECIFIC DATA REQUIREMENTS

### Geographic Parameters
We require all cancer incidence data for the following geographic boundaries:
- **Primary Study Area:** East Woburn residential district, bounded by the Aberjona River to the west, Route 38 to the east, with particular focus on the service area of Wells G and H
- **Comparison Areas:** West Woburn and surrounding municipalities for control population analysis
- **Radius Analysis:** All cases within a 2-mile radius of Wells G and H

### Temporal Parameters
- **Primary Study Period:** January 1, 1964 through December 31, 1980
- **Extended Analysis Period:** January 1, 1950 through December 31, 1980 for baseline comparison
- **Quarterly breakdown required for the period 1964-1980 to assess temporal clustering

### Demographic Specifications
**Age Groups:**
- Primary focus: Children ages 0-19 at time of diagnosis
- Secondary analysis: All ages for comprehensive assessment

**Cancer Types:**
- **Priority 1:** All leukemia cases (acute lymphocytic, acute myeloid, chronic forms)
- **Priority 2:** Other hematopoietic malignancies (lymphomas, multiple myeloma)
- **Priority 3:** All solid tumors for comprehensive analysis

### Required Data Elements
For each case identified, we require:
1. **Patient Demographics:** Age at diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity
2. **Geographic Information:** Residential address at time of diagnosis, length of residence
3. **Clinical Data:** Specific cancer type, date of diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, treatment facility
4. **Outcome Data:** Survival status, date of death if applicable
5. **Water Supply Information:** Municipal water source serving residence during relevant exposure period

## METHODOLOGY AND STATISTICAL APPROACH

### Case Definition
**Confirmed Case:** Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of leukemia in a child under age 20, with residence in the study area for minimum of six months prior to diagnosis.

**Probable Case:** Clinical diagnosis of leukemia with supporting laboratory evidence but without definitive histological confirmation, meeting residence criteria.

### Statistical Analysis Plan
1. **Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIR)** comparing observed versus expected cases based on Massachusetts state rates
2. **Spatial clustering analysis** using nearest neighbor and kernel density methods
3. **Temporal clustering assessment** using scan statistics and change-point analysis
4. **Dose-response evaluation** correlating distance from Wells G and H with incidence rates

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

Recent water quality testing has revealed significant contamination of Wells G and H with industrial solvents, including:
- **Trichloroethylene (TCE):** Detected at concentrations up to 400 parts per billion
- **Tetrachloroethylene (PCE):** Detected at concentrations up to 43 parts per billion
- **Other volatile organic compounds:** Various chlorinated solvents at lower concentrations

These concentrations substantially exceed current EPA guidelines and represent potential carcinogenic exposure levels for the served population. The temporal correlation between well opening dates and subsequent leukemia diagnoses suggests a possible causal relationship requiring urgent investigation.

## LEGAL AND REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS

This investigation carries significant legal implications, as affected families may pursue litigation against responsible parties for alleged negligence in the disposal of industrial chemicals that contaminated the municipal water supply. Our epidemiological analysis must meet the highest scientific standards to support potential legal proceedings while maintaining objectivity and scientific integrity.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has been notified of our investigation, and we anticipate coordination with EPA Region I regarding potential enforcement actions against industries identified as sources of contamination.

## TIMELINE AND DELIVERABLES

**Phase I (Immediate - 30 days):**
- Complete data extraction and compilation
- Preliminary statistical analysis
- Geographic mapping of cases

**Phase II (30-60 days):**
- Comprehensive epidemiological analysis
- Environmental correlation studies
- Draft report preparation

**Phase III (60-90 days):**
- Peer review and validation
- Final report completion
- Regulatory and legal consultation

## CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA SECURITY

All patient data will be handled in strict accordance with federal privacy regulations and CDC data security protocols. Individual patient identifiers will be removed following geographic and temporal coding, with access restricted to authorized epidemiological staff. Results will be reported in aggregate form only, protecting individual privacy while enabling scientific analysis.

## RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

We request priority processing of this data request given the public health urgency and ongoing legal developments. CDC will provide full reimbursement for data compilation costs and technical assistance for complex queries as needed.

## CONCLUSION

The Woburn childhood leukemia cluster represents a potential environmental health emergency requiring immediate scientific investigation. The death of James Anderson and the documented contamination of municipal Wells G and H create an urgent need for comprehensive epidemiological analysis to determine causation and protect public health.

We appreciate the Massachusetts Cancer Registry's cooperation in this critical investigation and look forward to your prompt response to this data request.
