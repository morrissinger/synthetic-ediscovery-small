# AFFIDAVIT

**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**

**MIDDLESEX COUNTY, ss.**

I, Robert M. Sullivan, being first duly sworn, depose and say:

## Personal Background and Employment

1. I am forty-three years of age and reside at 47 Maple Street, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801. I have lived in Woburn for the past eighteen years and am familiar with the community, its residents, and local businesses.

2. From March 1965 through September 1980, I was employed by W.R. Grace Company at their facility located at 410 Boston Street, Woburn, Massachusetts. During my fifteen years of employment, I held various positions within the company's operations, ultimately serving as a shift supervisor in the chemical processing department from 1974 until my departure.

3. My employment with W.R. Grace was terminated on September 15, 1980, following what the company characterized as "workforce reduction due to operational changes." However, I believe my termination was related to my growing concerns about the company's waste disposal practices and my inquiries to management regarding these practices.

## Knowledge of Chemical Operations and Disposal Practices

4. During my tenure at the W.R. Grace facility, I had direct knowledge of and participation in the company's chemical processing operations. The facility regularly used industrial solvents including trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (also known as perchloroethylene or PCE), and other chlorinated compounds in various manufacturing processes.

5. These solvents were used primarily for degreasing metal components and cleaning equipment. On average, the facility used approximately 200 to 300 gallons of TCE per month and 150 to 200 gallons of PCE per month during the period from 1970 through 1980.

6. I personally observed and, under direct orders from my supervisors, participated in the disposal of these chemical solvents on the company property. The standard practice, which I was told had been in place since at least the mid-1960s, involved pouring spent solvents and solvent-contaminated materials directly onto the ground in an area behind the main manufacturing building.

## Specific Disposal Incidents and Practices

7. The disposal area was located approximately 200 yards northeast of the main building, in what appeared to be a natural depression in the land. This area was not lined with any protective material, nor was it designed as a proper waste containment facility. Employees, including myself, were instructed to dump waste solvents, cleaning rags soaked with chemicals, and contaminated equipment washings directly onto the soil.

8. On numerous occasions between 1970 and 1980, I personally witnessed the disposal of substantial quantities of TCE and PCE. I recall specific instances where 50-gallon drums of spent solvent were emptied directly onto the ground. This occurred approximately once every two to three months during busy production periods.

9. In the summer of 1976, I observed what I believe was the largest single disposal event during my employment. Following a major equipment cleaning operation, approximately 300 gallons of TCE-contaminated waste was disposed of in the designated area over the course of three days. The smell was so strong that several employees complained of headaches and nausea.

10. When I questioned my immediate supervisor, Thomas Brennan, about the environmental safety of these disposal methods, he told me that the company had "looked into it" and that the chemicals would "break down naturally" in the soil. He instructed me not to discuss the disposal practices with anyone outside the company and emphasized that my job security depended on following company procedures without question.

## Knowledge of Water Supply Proximity

11. I was aware that the municipal water supply wells, specifically Wells G and H, were located in the general vicinity of our facility. Many of my coworkers lived in the neighborhoods served by these wells, and several had mentioned that their water occasionally had an unusual taste or odor, particularly during the summer months.

12. In approximately 1978, I learned from a conversation with a municipal worker that Wells G and H were located less than half a mile from the W.R. Grace facility. When I mentioned this proximity to my supervisor and suggested that our disposal practices might pose a risk to the water supply, I was told that the company's legal department had reviewed all disposal procedures and found them to be in compliance with applicable regulations.

## Management Knowledge and Corporate Awareness

13. Based on my observations and conversations with management personnel, I believe that W.R. Grace executives were aware of the disposal practices at the Woburn facility. During quarterly safety meetings, supervisors would remind employees about the importance of following "established procedures" for waste handling, which I understood to include the ground disposal methods I have described.

14. In 1979, I attended a company meeting where Regional Manager David Patterson discussed "cost-effective waste management" and praised the Woburn facility for keeping disposal costs lower than other company locations. While he did not explicitly describe the disposal methods, his comments suggested that upper management was aware of and approved of our practices.

15. On at least two occasions, I observed individuals who appeared to be company executives or consultants visiting the disposal area with plant management. These visits typically occurred during daylight hours when disposal activities were not taking place, but the visitors were shown the area and engaged in discussions with local management.

## Health and Environmental Concerns

16. During my final years of employment, I became increasingly concerned about potential health effects from our disposal practices. Several coworkers complained of persistent headaches, skin irritation, and respiratory problems that seemed to worsen during periods of heavy chemical use and disposal.

17. I also became aware through community conversations that there appeared to be an unusual number of childhood illnesses, particularly leukemia cases, in the neighborhoods surrounding our facility. While I cannot definitively establish a connection, the timing and proximity of these cases to our operations troubled me greatly.

18. My own health began to deteriorate during my final years of employment. I developed chronic respiratory problems and skin rashes that my physician could not definitively diagnose. These symptoms improved significantly after I left W.R. Grace employment, though they have not completely resolved.

## Reasons for Coming Forward

19. I am providing this sworn statement because I believe the public has a right to know about the disposal practices that occurred at the W.R. Grace facility. The recent news reports about contamination in the municipal water supply and the tragic deaths of children in our community have compelled me to speak out about what I witnessed during my employment.

20. I understand that by providing this testimony, I may face legal or financial consequences from my former employer. However, I believe that my moral obligation to the community, particularly to the families who have been affected by this contamination, outweighs any personal risks I may face.

21. I am prepared to testify under oath in any legal proceedings regarding these matters and to provide any additional information that may be helpful in determining the extent of contamination and the responsibility of W.R. Grace Company for any resulting harm.

## Conclusion

22. The information contained in this affidavit is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and recollection. I have not been promised any compensation or benefit in exchange for this testimony, nor have I been threatened or coerced in any way.

23. I understand the serious nature of these allegations and the potential legal implications for all parties involved. I am providing this information solely because I believe it is necessary for the protection of public health and the pursuit of justice for those who have been harmed by these disposal practices.

Further affiant sayeth not.
