**RE: Estate of Carl Robbins III - Authorization for Legal Representation in Wrongful Death Action**

Dear Mrs. Robbins:

This letter serves to confirm our discussion of July 29, 1981, regarding the tragic loss of your son, Carl Robbins III, and your decision to pursue legal action against those parties responsible for his untimely death. As we discussed, Carl's passing on March 14, 1981, at the age of eight years, represents not only an immeasurable personal loss to you and your family, but also appears to be directly connected to the contamination of Woburn's municipal water supply through Wells G and H.

Based on our preliminary investigation and the information you have provided regarding Carl's medical history, we believe there are substantial grounds for a wrongful death action. Carl was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in September 1974 at the age of two years and three months, after your family had been consuming water from the municipal wells for approximately eight years at your residence on Pine Street. The timing of his diagnosis, combined with the recent revelations regarding trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene contamination in Wells G and H, establishes a compelling factual pattern that supports legal action against the industrial defendants who disposed of these toxic chemicals in a manner that contaminated the groundwater supplying these municipal wells.

Our firm is prepared to represent you and the estate of Carl Robbins III in pursuing claims for wrongful death, conscious pain and suffering, medical expenses, and related damages against W.R. Grace Company, Cryovac Inc., Beatrice Foods, and John J. Riley Company, as well as any other parties whose negligent or reckless conduct contributed to the contamination of Woburn's water supply. We understand that Carl endured six and one-half years of treatments, hospitalizations, and suffering before succumbing to his illness, during which time you incurred substantial medical expenses and witnessed the devastating impact of this disease on your child's quality of life.

To proceed with this representation, we will require your formal authorization as the administrator of Carl's estate. Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 229, Section 2, you have the right to bring an action for wrongful death as Carl's surviving parent and the natural person entitled to administer his estate. We have prepared the necessary estate administration documents, including a Petition for Administration and supporting affidavits, which we will file with the Middlesex County Probate Court to establish your legal authority to pursue this action on Carl's behalf.

The evidence we have gathered thus far indicates that the defendant companies engaged in the systematic disposal of industrial solvents, including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, in areas where these chemicals could and did infiltrate the groundwater system serving Woburn's municipal wells. Internal company documents suggest that these defendants were aware, or should have been aware, that their disposal practices posed significant risks to public health, yet they continued these practices for years while families like yours unknowingly consumed contaminated water on a daily basis.

We anticipate that this litigation will be complex and protracted, involving extensive discovery regarding the defendants' disposal practices, expert testimony regarding the causal relationship between chemical exposure and leukemia, and detailed analysis of the hydrogeological conditions that allowed these contaminants to reach the municipal water supply. However, we are confident that the evidence will demonstrate that Carl's death was a direct and foreseeable consequence of the defendants' negligent and reckless conduct.

Our fee arrangement, as discussed, will be on a contingency basis, whereby our firm will advance all costs associated with the litigation and receive compensation only upon successful resolution of the case. This arrangement ensures that you will not bear any financial risk in pursuing justice for Carl, while providing our firm with the necessary incentive to pursue this matter vigorously and to its conclusion.

We recognize that no amount of monetary compensation can restore Carl to you or alleviate the profound grief you have experienced. However, this legal action serves multiple important purposes: it holds the responsible parties accountable for their conduct, provides financial support to help address the substantial costs you have incurred, and potentially prevents similar tragedies from befalling other families in the future by exposing the dangers of industrial chemical disposal practices.

Please review the enclosed estate administration documents and contact our office at your earliest convenience to schedule an appointment for execution of these materials. Once your authority as estate administrator is established, we will immediately commence formal discovery proceedings against all defendants to preserve evidence and begin building the comprehensive case record necessary to prove liability and damages.

We want to assure you that our firm is committed to pursuing this matter with the utmost diligence and professionalism. Carl's memory deserves nothing less than our complete dedication to achieving justice in his name. We look forward to working with you in this important endeavor and will keep you informed of all significant developments as the case proceeds.

Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you have any questions or concerns regarding this representation or the legal proceedings ahead.

Very truly yours,

**WOBURN LEGAL SERVICES**
