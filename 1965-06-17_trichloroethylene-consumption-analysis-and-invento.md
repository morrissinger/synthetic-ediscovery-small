## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of trichloroethylene (TCE) consumption patterns and inventory management at the W.R. Grace Company Woburn facility for the period January 1964 through May 1965. The analysis reveals significant increases in TCE usage corresponding to expanded production operations, particularly in the metal degreasing and chemical processing divisions. Current inventory levels and consumption rates are documented to support operational planning and regulatory compliance requirements.

## Introduction

Trichloroethylene serves as a critical industrial solvent in multiple manufacturing processes at the Woburn facility. Primary applications include metal degreasing operations for precision components, chemical intermediate processing, and equipment cleaning procedures. This analysis was conducted to evaluate consumption efficiency, identify potential cost savings opportunities, and ensure adequate inventory management for uninterrupted production operations.

The evaluation period covers 17 months of operational data, during which the facility experienced a 34% increase in overall production volume, necessitating corresponding increases in solvent consumption across all manufacturing divisions.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

Consumption data were compiled from daily production logs, chemical receiving records, and monthly inventory reports maintained by the Production Control Department. All measurements are reported in gallons unless otherwise specified. Waste generation estimates are based on standard industry calculations assuming 15% loss during normal operations.

### Analysis Parameters

- **Reporting Period:** January 1, 1964 - May 31, 1965
- **Measurement Units:** Gallons (liquid volume at 68°F)
- **Inventory Locations:** Main storage tank (15,000 gallon capacity), secondary storage (5,000 gallon capacity), department day tanks (500 gallon total capacity)
- **Quality Standards:** Industrial grade TCE, minimum 99.5% purity per specification WG-CHEM-147

## Findings

### Consumption Analysis

**Total TCE Consumption by Quarter:**

| Quarter | Consumption (Gallons) | Production Index | Efficiency Ratio |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Q1 1964 | 8,450 | 100 | 1.00 |
| Q2 1964 | 9,200 | 108 | 1.02 |
| Q3 1964 | 10,800 | 115 | 1.12 |
| Q4 1964 | 12,300 | 125 | 1.18 |
| Q1 1965 | 13,750 | 134 | 1.23 |
| Q2 1965* | 7,200 | 142 | 1.25 |

*Q2 1965 represents partial quarter (April-May only)

### Department-Specific Usage

**Metal Degreasing Operations:** Accounts for 67% of total TCE consumption. Primary usage occurs in Building 3 degreasing bays where precision metal components undergo cleaning prior to assembly. Average consumption rate: 45 gallons per production day.

**Chemical Processing Division:** Represents 28% of consumption, primarily for intermediate chemical synthesis and reaction vessel cleaning. Usage concentrated in Buildings 5 and 7. Average consumption rate: 18 gallons per production day.

**Maintenance and General Cleaning:** Accounts for remaining 5% of consumption across facility maintenance operations and equipment cleaning procedures.

### Inventory Management

**Current Inventory Status (as of June 15, 1965):**
- Main Storage Tank: 11,200 gallons (75% capacity)
- Secondary Storage: 3,800 gallons (76% capacity)
- Department Day Tanks: 380 gallons (76% capacity)
- **Total On-Site Inventory:** 15,380 gallons

**Procurement Schedule:** Monthly deliveries of 8,000 gallons from Dow Chemical Company under contract WG-DOW-1964-15. Next scheduled delivery: June 28, 1965.

### Waste Generation and Disposal

Based on consumption patterns and operational procedures, estimated TCE waste generation averages 2,100 gallons per quarter. Waste materials consist primarily of:

- Spent solvent from degreasing operations (contaminated with metal particles and oils)
- Process residues from chemical synthesis operations
- Equipment cleaning waste and spill cleanup materials

Current disposal procedures involve temporary storage in approved containers pending pickup by licensed waste contractor Riley Disposal Services under service agreement RDS-1963-08. Waste pickup occurs monthly with materials transported to approved disposal sites.

### Cost Analysis

**Total TCE Procurement Costs (17-month period):**
- Chemical Purchase: $76,400
- Transportation and Handling: $3,200
- Storage and Inventory Management: $1,800
- **Total Cost:** $81,400
- **Average Cost per Gallon:** $0.52

## Conclusions

The analysis reveals consistent increases in TCE consumption correlating directly with expanded production operations. Consumption efficiency ratios indicate stable operational procedures with minimal waste generation during normal operations. Current inventory management practices provide adequate supply security while minimizing storage costs.

The 34% increase in production volume during the evaluation period resulted in a corresponding 38% increase in TCE consumption, indicating slight efficiency degradation likely attributable to startup inefficiencies in new production lines and training of additional personnel.

## Recommendations

### Operational Improvements

1. **Process Optimization:** Implement solvent recovery systems in high-volume degreasing operations to reduce consumption by an estimated 12-15%. Initial capital investment estimated at $18,000 with 14-month payback period.

2. **Inventory Management:** Increase main storage capacity to 20,000 gallons to achieve volume purchase discounts and reduce delivery frequency. Estimated annual savings: $4,200.

3. **Training Programs:** Develop standardized procedures for TCE handling and usage to minimize waste generation and improve safety compliance.

### Safety and Compliance

1. **Monitoring Enhancement:** Install additional ventilation monitoring equipment in Buildings 3, 5, and 7 to ensure compliance with occupational exposure limits.

2. **Documentation Improvement:** Implement daily usage logging procedures for all departments to improve consumption tracking and regulatory compliance.

3. **Emergency Preparedness:** Develop comprehensive spill response procedures and ensure adequate cleanup materials are maintained at all usage locations.

### Future Planning

Based on projected production increases of 15% annually, estimated TCE requirements for 1966 will reach approximately 65,000 gallons. Procurement planning should account for potential supply chain disruptions and price volatility in the industrial solvent market.
