### AGENDA ITEM: WELLS G AND H CONTAMINATION - WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS

Chairman Bolduc called the emergency session to order at 2:05 PM, noting the urgent nature of developments in East Woburn, Massachusetts regarding contamination discovered in municipal water Wells G and H.

**Background Presentation - David Martinez, VP Environmental Affairs:**

Mr. Martinez provided a comprehensive briefing on the situation at our Cryovac facility located at 369 Washington Street, East Woburn. He reported that in May 1979, routine testing of municipal Wells G and H revealed significant concentrations of volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethylene (TCE), which has been used in our manufacturing processes since the facility's establishment in 1954.

The wells, which opened in 1964 and 1966 respectively, have served as supplemental water sources for eastern Woburn neighborhoods. Initial testing results indicate TCE concentrations ranging from 21 to 267 parts per billion in Well G, and 6 to 184 parts per billion in Well H. These levels exceed acceptable standards and have prompted immediate closure of both wells by Woburn municipal authorities.

Mr. Martinez emphasized that our Cryovac operation has utilized TCE and other industrial solvents as degreasers and cleaning agents in our packaging machinery manufacturing processes. Historical disposal practices at the facility included on-site waste management consistent with industry standards of the time period.

**Legal Assessment - Charles Wheeler, General Counsel:**

Mr. Wheeler outlined potential legal exposures facing the company. He noted that preliminary investigations suggest our facility may be one of several industrial operations in the Aberjona River Valley that could be implicated in groundwater contamination. Other potentially responsible parties include Beatrice Foods Inc., which operates the John J. Riley Company tannery southwest of the wells.

Key legal concerns identified:
- Potential negligence claims related to waste disposal practices
- Breach of duty allegations regarding environmental stewardship
- Possible wrongful death litigation if health impacts are established
- Regulatory enforcement actions by EPA and Massachusetts authorities

Mr. Wheeler stressed that while our disposal practices were consistent with industry standards and regulatory requirements at the time, evolving environmental law and changing public attitudes toward industrial waste management create significant litigation risk.

**Risk Management Analysis - Kenneth Walsh:**

Mr. Walsh presented preliminary risk assessments, noting that approximately 5,000 residents may have been exposed to contaminated water from Wells G and H during their operational period. He reported concerning preliminary health data suggesting elevated rates of childhood leukemia in affected neighborhoods, though causation has not been scientifically established.

Insurance coverage analysis indicates potential gaps in our environmental liability policies for claims arising from historical disposal practices. Mr. Walsh recommended immediate retention of specialized environmental counsel and toxicology experts to assess our exposure.

**Operational Impact - Patricia Coleman, Cryovac Division:**

Ms. Coleman reported that the Woburn facility continues normal operations with enhanced waste management protocols. She noted that implementation of improved environmental controls may require capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 million over the next eighteen months.

The facility employs 127 people and generates annual revenues of $18.6 million. Ms. Coleman expressed concern that negative publicity could impact customer relationships and employee morale.

### BOARD DISCUSSION

Director Frist questioned whether the company should consider voluntary remediation measures to demonstrate corporate responsibility. Chairman Bolduc noted that such actions, while potentially beneficial from a public relations standpoint, could be construed as admission of liability.

President Grace emphasized the importance of protecting shareholder interests while maintaining our commitment to environmental stewardship. He noted that the company has consistently complied with applicable regulations throughout the facility's operation.

Director Preska raised concerns about potential impacts on our corporate reputation and suggested consideration of community outreach initiatives to address public concerns.

### RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED

**RESOLVED:** That the company engage Covington & Burling LLP as special environmental counsel to represent W.R. Grace Company in all matters related to the Wells G and H contamination investigation.

**RESOLVED:** That the company retain Environmental Science & Engineering Inc. to conduct comprehensive environmental assessment of the Cryovac facility and surrounding areas.

**RESOLVED:** That a special committee consisting of Directors Frist, Preska, and General Counsel Wheeler be established to oversee the company's response to the Woburn situation and report regularly to the full board.

**RESOLVED:** That the company implement enhanced environmental monitoring and waste management protocols at all manufacturing facilities to prevent similar situations.

### ACTION ITEMS

1. **General Counsel Wheeler** - Retain specialized environmental counsel within 48 hours
2. **VP Martinez** - Coordinate with regulatory authorities and provide requested documentation
3. **Director Walsh** - Complete comprehensive insurance coverage analysis by October 30, 1979
4. **Division Manager Coleman** - Implement enhanced environmental controls at Woburn facility
5. **Corporate Secretary Harrison** - Prepare board resolution authorizing defense fund of up to $5 million for legal and technical expenses

### NEXT MEETING

The board scheduled a follow-up meeting for November 15, 1979, to review progress on action items and assess developments in the Woburn situation.
