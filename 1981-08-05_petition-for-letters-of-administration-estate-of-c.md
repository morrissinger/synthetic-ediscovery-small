TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

**I. DECEDENT INFORMATION**

The decedent, Carl Robbins III, was born on March 15, 1964, and died intestate on July 23, 1981, at the age of seventeen (17) years. At the time of his death, the decedent was unmarried and had no children. The decedent was a resident of Woburn, Massachusetts, and had resided at 47 Pine Street, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801, with his family from birth until the time of his death.

No other heirs at law survive the decedent. The decedent left no will or testament, having died intestate.

**III. ESTATE ASSETS**

To the best of petitioner's knowledge and belief, the decedent died possessed of the following property:

- Personal effects and clothing of minimal value
- Savings account at Woburn Savings Bank, Account No. 47851, approximate balance $247.50
- 1978 Honda motorcycle, registration number 4B7829, estimated value $800.00

- Dr. Margaret Fleming, oncology services, estimated amount $2,156.00
- Woburn Pharmacy prescription charges, estimated amount $345.78
- Funeral expenses to Costello Funeral Home, amount $2,890.00

Total estimated debts and liabilities: $26,473.58

**V. ADMINISTRATION NECESSITY**

Administration of this estate is necessary for the following reasons:

1. To collect and preserve the assets of the decedent
2. To pay the lawful debts of the decedent
3. To investigate potential claims against third parties arising from the wrongful death of the decedent
4. To pursue legal remedies available to the estate for damages resulting from the decedent's illness and death
5. To distribute any remaining assets to the heirs at law according to the laws of intestate succession

**VI. CAUSE OF DEATH AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS**

The decedent died of acute lymphocytic leukemia after a prolonged illness lasting approximately four (4) years. The decedent was first diagnosed with leukemia in August 1977 at the age of thirteen. Throughout his entire life, the decedent and his family consumed water from the municipal water supply of Woburn, Massachusetts, specifically from Wells G and H, which have recently been determined to contain dangerous levels of industrial chemicals including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene.

The petitioner believes that the decedent's illness and death may have been caused by exposure to contaminated drinking water supplied by the City of Woburn, and that said contamination may have resulted from the improper disposal of industrial chemicals by various corporations operating in the vicinity of said wells. The petitioner reserves the right to pursue all legal remedies available to the estate against any and all parties who may be responsible for the decedent's illness and death.

**VII. PETITIONER'S QUALIFICATIONS**

The petitioner is qualified to serve as administratrix of said estate for the following reasons:

1. She is the mother of the decedent and his closest surviving relative
2. She is a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
3. She is of legal age and sound mind
4. She is not under any legal disability
5. She has no interest adverse to the estate
6. She is willing and able to faithfully discharge the duties of administratrix

**VIII. BOND**

The petitioner requests that she be appointed administratrix of said estate without surety on her official bond, as authorized by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 205, Section 1, or alternatively, that the bond be set in the minimal amount permitted by law, given the limited assets of the estate and the substantial debts and liabilities.

**IX. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the petitioner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Grant Letters of Administration to the petitioner, appointing her as administratrix of the estate of Carl Robbins III;
2. Authorize the petitioner to act without surety on her official bond, or alternatively, set the bond in the minimal amount permitted by law;
3. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

**VERIFICATION**

I, Donna Robbins, being first duly sworn, depose and say that I am the petitioner in the above-entitled matter; that I have read the foregoing petition and know the contents thereof; and that the same is true to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.
