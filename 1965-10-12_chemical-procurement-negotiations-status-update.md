# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** William H. Morrison, Operations Manager  
**FROM:** Robert M. Fletcher, Purchasing Agent  
**DATE:** October 12, 1965  
**RE:** Chemical Procurement Negotiations Status Update

Bill,

I wanted to update you on the status of our ongoing negotiations with chemical suppliers for the fourth quarter and early 1966 requirements. As you know, our production schedules have been running at capacity, and we need to ensure adequate supplies of our key chemical inputs to maintain operations without interruption.

**Trichloroethylene (TCE) Supply Contract:**
I've been working with Monsanto Chemical and Dow Chemical on our primary TCE requirements. Monsanto has offered a competitive rate of $0.18 per gallon for industrial grade TCE, with delivery terms FOB their plant in Springfield. Dow's pricing is slightly higher at $0.19 per gallon, but they're offering more flexible delivery scheduling which could help with our storage capacity constraints. Given our current usage rate of approximately 2,800 gallons per month, I recommend we split the contract 60/40 between Monsanto and Dow to ensure supply security. Both suppliers have confirmed they can meet our purity specifications for the plastic film manufacturing process.

**Perchloroethylene (PCE) and Cleaning Solvents:**
Our negotiations with Allied Chemical for PCE are proceeding well. They've agreed to maintain the current pricing structure of $0.22 per gallon through the first quarter of 1966, with a modest increase of 3% thereafter. This is acceptable given the current market conditions. For our degreasing operations, I've also secured favorable terms with DuPont for their Freon TF solvent, which has proven effective in our parts cleaning processes. The pricing is higher than our traditional solvents, but the improved cleaning performance justifies the additional cost.

**Disposal and Waste Management:**
As requested, I've been exploring options for our waste chemical disposal. John J. Riley Company has provided a comprehensive proposal for handling our spent solvents and chemical waste. Their pricing is competitive at $0.08 per gallon for liquid waste pickup and disposal, with monthly service available. Riley Company has assured me they have all necessary permits and disposal capabilities. This would eliminate the need for our current on-site handling procedures and should address the concerns raised by the state inspector during his visit last month.

I'll have final contract recommendations ready for your review by Friday. Please let me know if you need any additional details on these negotiations or if there are other procurement priorities I should be addressing.
