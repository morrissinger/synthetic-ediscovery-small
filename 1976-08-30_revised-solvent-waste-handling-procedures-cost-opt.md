**INTERNAL POLICY MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Plant Operations Staff - All Departments  
**FROM:** W.R. Grace Environmental Compliance Division  
**DATE:** August 30, 1976  
**RE:** Revised Solvent Waste Handling Procedures - Cost Optimization Initiative

---

## Executive Summary

Following comprehensive review of current waste disposal practices and associated operational costs, the Environmental Compliance Division has developed revised procedures for handling industrial solvents and related chemical waste materials. These modifications are designed to optimize disposal costs while maintaining compliance with existing regulatory frameworks. All plant operations personnel are required to implement these procedures effective September 15, 1976.

## Background and Rationale

Current disposal costs for industrial solvents have increased by approximately 40% over the past eighteen months, primarily due to expanded contractor requirements and transportation expenses to approved disposal facilities. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering has indicated that additional regulatory changes may be forthcoming, potentially further increasing compliance costs. In response to these economic pressures, management has authorized the implementation of alternative disposal methods that will reduce operational expenses while meeting current legal requirements.

The revised procedures outlined herein have been reviewed by corporate legal counsel and determined to be consistent with existing federal and state environmental regulations. Plant operations staff should note that these procedures represent standard industry practices employed by comparable manufacturing facilities throughout New England.

## Revised Disposal Procedures

### Primary Solvent Waste Categories

**Category A - High Volume Solvents:** Trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and related chlorinated compounds used in degreasing operations shall be collected in designated 55-gallon drums marked with appropriate hazard classifications. When drum capacity reaches 80% (approximately 44 gallons), contents may be transferred to on-site evaporation ponds located in the northeast section of the facility property. Evaporation ponds shall be monitored weekly for capacity and covered during precipitation events exceeding 0.5 inches.

**Category B - Mixed Industrial Solvents:** Benzene, toluene, xylene, and similar aromatic compounds may be disposed of through controlled subsurface injection when volumes exceed 200 gallons per month. Injection wells shall be located a minimum of 500 feet from property boundaries and 100 feet from existing structures. Injection depth shall not exceed 15 feet below grade to ensure adequate soil filtration.

**Category C - Water-Soluble Compounds:** Methanol, acetone, and similar compounds may be diluted with process water at ratios not exceeding 1:10 before discharge to municipal sewer systems, provided total monthly volumes remain below 1,000 gallons. Discharge shall occur during periods of high municipal water flow to ensure adequate dilution.

### Documentation Requirements

All disposal activities must be logged in the Environmental Compliance Register (Form EC-401) maintained in each department. Entries shall include date, waste type, volume, disposal method, and supervising personnel. Monthly summaries shall be forwarded to the Environmental Compliance Division by the 15th of each following month. Original disposal records must be retained for a minimum of two years.

### Cost Reduction Targets

Implementation of these revised procedures is projected to reduce annual waste disposal costs by approximately $125,000, representing a 35% decrease from current expenditures. Department supervisors are encouraged to identify additional opportunities for waste minimization through process optimization and material substitution where feasible.

## Safety Considerations

Personnel involved in waste handling operations must continue to utilize appropriate personal protective equipment including chemical-resistant gloves, safety goggles, and respiratory protection when working with volatile compounds. The facility medical office maintains current material safety data sheets for all chemicals used in operations. Any incidents involving chemical exposure must be reported immediately to the shift supervisor and documented according to existing protocols.

Employees should be aware that certain solvents may produce vapors that can accumulate in low-lying areas. Adequate ventilation must be maintained in all work areas, and personnel should avoid prolonged exposure to chemical vapors. The company medical program includes annual health screenings for all employees working with industrial chemicals.

## Regulatory Compliance

These procedures have been developed in consultation with environmental engineering consultants and reviewed for compliance with current Environmental Protection Agency guidelines and Massachusetts environmental regulations. The company maintains appropriate permits for all disposal activities and conducts regular monitoring of groundwater and soil conditions in accordance with applicable requirements.

Plant operations staff should direct any questions regarding regulatory compliance to the Environmental Compliance Division. Changes to federal or state regulations that may affect these procedures will be communicated through standard company notification channels.

## Implementation Timeline

**September 1-15, 1976:** Training period for all operations personnel  
**September 15, 1976:** Full implementation of revised procedures  
**October 15, 1976:** First monthly compliance report due  
**December 1, 1976:** Quarterly cost analysis and procedure review

Department supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all personnel under their supervision receive appropriate training on these revised procedures. Training documentation must be completed and filed with Human Resources by September 10, 1976.
