## Executive Summary

This technical analysis presents a comprehensive inventory of chemical substances recommended for leather processing operations at the John J. Riley Company tannery facility in East Woburn, Massachusetts. The chemical formulations listed herein represent current industry standards for hide preparation, tanning, and finishing processes as practiced in modern leather manufacturing establishments throughout New England.

The Boston Chemical Supply Company has conducted this analysis based upon our extensive experience supplying chemical materials to leather processing facilities across Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island since 1887. Our recommendations reflect proven methodologies for achieving superior leather quality while maintaining operational efficiency in commercial tanning operations.

## Methodology

This inventory analysis was prepared through consultation with our senior chemical engineers and review of successful applications at comparable leather processing facilities. Chemical quantities are calculated based upon projected annual production capacity of 50,000 processed hides as indicated in correspondence from Mr. John J. Riley dated October 15, 1909.

All chemical specifications conform to current industry practices and availability through established supply chains serving the Massachusetts leather manufacturing sector. Pricing estimates reflect current market conditions and anticipated stability through the 1910 production season.

## Storage and Handling Recommendations

The chemical inventory outlined above requires appropriate storage facilities with consideration for material compatibility and safety requirements. We recommend construction of a dedicated chemical storage building with separate compartments for acids, bases, solvents, and toxic materials.

Particular attention should be paid to the storage of chlorinated solvents and heavy metal compounds, which require secure containment to prevent environmental release. Ground-level storage with adequate drainage systems will prevent accumulation of spilled materials and facilitate cleanup operations.

Workers handling these materials should be provided with appropriate protective equipment including rubber gloves, protective eyewear, and ventilation masks where indicated. Regular training on proper handling procedures will minimize risk of workplace accidents and ensure optimal material utilization.
