Woburn, Massachusetts 01801

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Toomey,

I hope this letter finds you both well during this most difficult time. As we discussed during my visit yesterday evening, I am writing to formally document the commencement of hospice care services for your beloved son Patrick, effective immediately. After careful consultation with Dr. Samuel Weinstein at Massachusetts General Hospital and your family physician Dr. Robert Chen, we have determined that transitioning Patrick to comfort care at home represents the most appropriate and compassionate course of action at this stage of his illness.

Patrick's condition has progressed significantly since his initial diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia in September 1979. Despite the aggressive treatment protocols he has endured over the past eighteen months—including multiple rounds of chemotherapy with vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase, as well as cranial radiation therapy—the disease has unfortunately advanced to a point where curative interventions are no longer viable. Dr. Weinstein has indicated that Patrick's blast cell count remains elevated at over 85%, and his recent bone marrow biopsy shows extensive infiltration consistent with refractory disease. The medical team agrees that continuing with intensive chemotherapy would likely cause more suffering than benefit, particularly given Patrick's weakened state and the severe side effects he has already endured.

Our hospice care program is specifically designed to ensure that Patrick remains as comfortable as possible while surrounded by the love and familiarity of his home environment. I will be coordinating a comprehensive care plan that addresses not only his physical needs but also provides emotional and spiritual support for your entire family during this journey. We will be implementing a pain management protocol using morphine sulfate as needed, administered both orally and subcutaneously as his condition requires. Additionally, we will provide anti-nausea medications, including Compazine and Tigan, to help manage any discomfort from his treatments or the progression of his illness.

The care team will consist of myself as your primary nurse, visiting three times weekly initially and increasing frequency as needed, along with Dr. Chen who will continue as Patrick's attending physician making house calls as required. We have also arranged for a home health aide, Mrs. Dorothy Sullivan, who will assist with Patrick's daily care needs including bathing, feeding, and mobility assistance. Mrs. Sullivan has extensive experience working with pediatric patients and comes highly recommended from our staff. Should you require additional support, we can also arrange for a social worker and chaplain services through our interfaith program.

I want to ensure you understand that choosing hospice care does not mean we are giving up on Patrick. Rather, we are shifting our focus from attempting to cure his disease to ensuring his remaining time is filled with dignity, comfort, and the precious moments that matter most to a twelve-year-old boy. We will continue to monitor his condition closely and adjust his care plan as needed. If at any point his symptoms become unmanageable at home, we maintain privileges at Woburn Hospital and can arrange for inpatient hospice care if necessary, though our goal is to honor your wishes to keep Patrick at home with his family.

During our consultation, you expressed concerns about Patrick's awareness of his condition and how much he understands about his prognosis. This is completely natural, and we will work together to provide age-appropriate information while following your guidance as his parents regarding what and how much to share with him. Children Patrick's age often have an intuitive understanding of their condition, and we have found that honest, gentle communication typically helps reduce anxiety rather than increase it. Our social worker, Mrs. Janet Morrison, specializes in helping families navigate these difficult conversations and will be available to meet with you and Patrick whenever you feel ready.

I also want to address the practical aspects of Patrick's care at home. We will be providing a hospital bed, which will make it easier to position him comfortably and assist with his care. The bed should be delivered tomorrow afternoon, and I will coordinate with you regarding its placement in your home. We will also supply a bedside commode, wheelchair for mobility when he feels up to it, and all necessary medical supplies including syringes, gauze, and medications. Our pharmacy partner, Woburn Apothecary, will coordinate directly with Dr. Chen for all prescription needs and can provide same-day delivery when required.

Given Patrick's diagnosis and the timeline we are facing, I want to ensure you are both prepared for the changes you may observe in the coming weeks. Patients with advanced leukemia often experience increased fatigue, decreased appetite, and periods of confusion or disorientation. These symptoms can be managed effectively with proper medication and care. Patrick may also experience pain in his bones and joints, which is unfortunately common with his condition, but we have excellent pain management protocols that will keep him comfortable. I will be monitoring him closely for any signs of infection, bleeding, or other complications that require immediate attention.

The emotional toll of caring for a terminally ill child cannot be understated, and I want both of you to know that our support extends to the entire family. We have support group meetings every Tuesday evening at our Brookline office for parents facing similar situations, and many families have found great comfort in connecting with others who understand their journey. Additionally, we can arrange respite care services to give you both breaks when needed—caring for Patrick is a tremendous responsibility, and maintaining your own health and well-being is essential for providing him with the best possible care.

I have spoken with several other families in the Woburn area who have faced similar circumstances, and while I cannot share specific details due to confidentiality, I can tell you that you are not alone in this struggle. There seems to be an unusual concentration of childhood leukemia cases in your neighborhood, which has not gone unnoticed by the medical community. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has been conducting investigations into potential environmental factors, and while this information may not provide immediate comfort, it may be relevant for future families and could potentially lead to important discoveries about prevention.

Please know that our entire team is committed to supporting Patrick and your family through this difficult time. We will work tirelessly to ensure that his remaining days are filled with as much comfort, love, and normalcy as possible. I encourage you to continue with the activities Patrick enjoys when he feels up to it—reading together, watching his favorite television programs, visits from friends and extended family. These moments of joy and connection are incredibly important for his emotional well-being and will create lasting memories for all of you.

I will be calling you this evening to check on how Patrick is feeling today and to answer any additional questions that may have arisen since our meeting. Please do not hesitate to contact me at any time, day or night, if you have concerns or if Patrick's condition changes. My home number is (617) 734-2891, and the answering service will page me immediately for any urgent situations. We also have a 24-hour on-call nurse available through our main number should you need assistance when I am not available.

With deepest sympathy and commitment to your family's care,

Margaret O'Brien, R.N.

**P.S.** I have enclosed several pamphlets about pediatric hospice care and grief support resources that you may find helpful. Additionally, I have included contact information for the Candlelighters Foundation, a national organization that provides support specifically for families of children with cancer.
