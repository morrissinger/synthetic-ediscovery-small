# INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Facilities Management  
**FROM:** R. Mitchell, Maintenance Supervisor  
**DATE:** March 19, 1968  
**RE:** Waste Disposal Incident Report - Ground Surface Contamination

This memo serves to document a waste disposal incident that occurred on March 18, 1968, at approximately 11:30 AM in the rear disposal area adjacent to Building C. During routine maintenance operations, a significant spill of industrial solvents was observed on the ground surface near the designated waste storage area. The incident involved approximately 200 gallons of mixed chemical waste, primarily consisting of trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) used in our Cryovac manufacturing processes.

The spill appears to have resulted from a rupture in one of the 55-gallon drums used for temporary waste storage prior to disposal. Upon inspection, several additional drums in the storage area showed signs of corrosion and potential leakage. The affected area measures approximately 30 feet by 20 feet, with visible surface staining and a strong chemical odor present. Immediate containment efforts were initiated using available absorbent materials, though a substantial portion of the waste had already penetrated into the soil. The maintenance crew covered the affected area with sand and lime as a temporary measure.

Given the proximity of this disposal area to the Aberjona River and the recent opening of municipal wells in the eastern section of Woburn, I recommend we review our current waste storage and disposal procedures. The affected area is located approximately 800 feet from the river and sits upgradient from the residential areas served by the new municipal water supply. While our current disposal practices comply with existing regulations, this incident highlights potential vulnerabilities in our waste management system that could affect surrounding properties and water sources.

I have initiated temporary measures to prevent further incidents, including relocating remaining waste drums to a more secure storage area and arranging for immediate removal of contaminated soil. However, I believe a comprehensive review of our waste disposal protocols is warranted to prevent similar occurrences and ensure continued compliance with our operational standards. Please advise on next steps for permanent remediation of the affected area.
