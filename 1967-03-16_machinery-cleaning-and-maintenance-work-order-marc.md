## MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES REQUIRED

### 1. Machine Shutdown and Preparation
Begin shutdown procedures for Extrusion Line #4 at 3:30 PM shift change. Ensure all electrical connections are properly disconnected and tagged. Allow machinery to cool for minimum 45 minutes before beginning cleaning operations.

### 2. Solvent Application and Cleaning
Apply industrial cleaning solvents to all machinery surfaces requiring degreasing. Use standard trichloroethylene (TCE) solution for heavy degreasing of extrusion components. For lighter cleaning applications, utilize perchloroethylene (PCE) mixture as specified in maintenance manual Section 4.2. 

**Cleaning Protocol:**
- Spray all accessible surfaces with solvent mixture
- Allow 15-minute dwell time for penetration
- Scrub with wire brushes where necessary
- Rinse with additional solvent application
- Wipe down with industrial rags

### 3. Waste Disposal Procedures
All used cleaning solvents and contaminated materials are to be disposed of through standard facility procedures. Used solvent solutions should be collected in designated containers and transported to the rear disposal area behind Building 3. Contaminated rags and debris may be disposed of in the general waste containers or burned in the facility incinerator as conditions permit.

Excess solvent not absorbed by cleaning materials should be directed to floor drains for proper disposal through the facility drainage system. Ensure adequate ventilation during all cleaning operations to maintain worker safety standards.

### 4. Equipment Inspection and Testing
Following completion of cleaning operations, conduct thorough inspection of all machinery components. Check for proper operation of heating elements, sealing mechanisms, and ventilation systems. Document any equipment deficiencies requiring additional maintenance attention.

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

All maintenance personnel must wear appropriate protective equipment including safety goggles and work gloves during solvent handling operations. Ensure adequate ventilation in work areas during cleaning procedures. Any personnel experiencing dizziness or respiratory discomfort should immediately report to supervision and seek fresh air.

The cleaning solvents being utilized are industrial-grade chemicals that require careful handling. While these materials are standard throughout the manufacturing industry, proper ventilation and disposal procedures must be followed to maintain workplace safety standards.
