# Weekly Waste Disposal Summary - Wooded Area Behind Main Building

**RE:** Weekly Waste Disposal Summary - Wooded Area Behind Main Building

## Summary of Disposal Activities (Week of August 22-28, 1947)

This report summarizes waste disposal operations conducted in the wooded area located approximately 200 yards southwest of the main tannery building during the week ending August 28, 1947. All disposal activities were conducted in accordance with current facility procedures and within the designated disposal zones previously established for tannery waste materials.

### Chemical Waste Disposal

During the reporting period, a total of 847 gallons of liquid chemical waste was disposed of in the wooded area disposal site. This material consisted primarily of spent tanning solutions, chromium-bearing liquids from the chrome tanning process, and various cleaning solvents used in hide preparation and finishing operations. The disposal was conducted using the standard pit method, with materials being poured directly into the established excavation sites located in the northeastern section of the wooded area.

The chemical composition of disposed materials included:
- Chrome tanning liquor (approximately 425 gallons)
- Acid solutions from pickling operations (approximately 198 gallons)
- Degreasing solvents including carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene (approximately 156 gallons)
- Mixed cleaning solutions and dyes (approximately 68 gallons)

### Solid Waste Materials

Solid waste disposal during the week totaled approximately 2.3 tons of material, consisting primarily of hair and flesh removed during hide processing, defective leather pieces, and various manufacturing debris. This material was deposited in the central disposal area of the wooded site and covered with approximately six inches of soil excavated from the surrounding area.

### Site Conditions and Observations

Weather conditions during the disposal period were generally favorable, with temperatures ranging from 68 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit and minimal precipitation. Ground conditions in the disposal area remained firm and suitable for vehicle access. The disposal pits showed normal absorption rates for liquid materials, with most chemical waste appearing to penetrate the soil within 24-48 hours of disposal.

No unusual odors or visible seepage were observed beyond the immediate disposal area during routine inspections. The wooded area continues to provide adequate screening from neighboring properties and maintains the discrete nature of disposal operations as required by facility policy.

### Operational Recommendations

Based on current disposal rates and site capacity, the existing disposal areas should accommodate facility needs for approximately 8-10 additional weeks before expansion into the southern section of the wooded area becomes necessary. I recommend beginning preliminary site preparation in that area during the first week of September to ensure continuity of disposal operations.

The recent increase in solvent usage, particularly trichloroethylene for degreasing operations, has resulted in higher volumes of chemical waste requiring disposal. Current pit capacity appears adequate for these increased volumes, though monitoring of absorption rates should continue to ensure proper site performance.

### Cost Analysis

Total disposal costs for the reporting period were $23.50, consisting of:
- Labor for pit excavation and maintenance: $18.00
- Fuel for transportation equipment: $3.25
- Soil covering materials: $2.25

These costs remain well within budgeted parameters for waste disposal operations and represent a significant savings compared to alternative disposal methods that would require transportation to off-site facilities.

### Personnel and Safety

All disposal activities were conducted by regular facility personnel under direct supervision. Standard safety procedures were followed, including the use of protective clothing when handling chemical materials and proper ventilation practices during solvent disposal operations. No incidents or accidents occurred during the reporting period.

The disposal crew consisted of Thomas Kowalski, Stanley Novak, and Robert Fitzgerald, all of whom have been properly trained in facility disposal procedures and are familiar with the safety requirements for handling tannery waste materials.

### Future Considerations

The wooded disposal area continues to provide an effective and economical solution for facility waste management needs. The remote location and natural screening offered by the existing vegetation ensure that disposal operations remain discrete and do not interfere with normal facility operations or neighboring properties.

As production levels continue to increase in response to post-war demand for leather goods, waste volumes are expected to grow correspondingly. The current disposal site should accommodate these increased volumes for the foreseeable future, particularly with the planned expansion into the southern section of the wooded area.

Regular monitoring of site conditions and disposal effectiveness will continue on a weekly basis, with any significant changes or concerns reported immediately to plant management.
