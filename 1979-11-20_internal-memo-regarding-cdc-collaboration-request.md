# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Director, Massachusetts Department of Public Health  
**FROM:** Dr. Michael Thompson, Chief, Division of Environmental Health Assessment  
**DATE:** November 20, 1979  
**RE:** Proposed CDC Collaboration on East Woburn Health Investigation

## Purpose

This memo outlines my recommendation for formal collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control regarding the ongoing health investigation in East Woburn. Following the closure of Wells G and H in May 1979 due to volatile organic contamination, we have received multiple requests from affected families and local physicians concerning potential health impacts from long-term exposure to contaminated municipal water.

## Current Situation

Since the well closures, our preliminary review has identified several concerning patterns that warrant expanded epidemiological investigation. Dr. Sarah Weinberg from our Cancer Surveillance Unit has documented an apparent cluster of childhood leukemia cases in the neighborhoods served by Wells G and H during their fifteen-year operational period (1964-1979). Specifically, we have confirmed diagnoses in at least six children under age twelve, with onset dates ranging from 1972 to 1979. This represents a statistically significant elevation above expected incidence rates for this demographic and geographic area.

The contamination source appears linked to industrial operations in the Aberjona River Valley, particularly the W.R. Grace facility operated by Cryovac Inc. at 369 Washington Street and the former John J. Riley tannery property owned by Beatrice Foods. Testing conducted by the EPA in June revealed trichloroethylene concentrations of 267 parts per billion in Well G and 21 parts per billion in Well H—levels far exceeding safe drinking water standards. Additional volatile organic compounds detected include tetrachloroethylene, chloroform, and 1,2-dichloroethylene.

## CDC Collaboration Benefits

The Centers for Disease Control possesses specialized expertise in environmental health investigations that would significantly enhance our analytical capabilities. Their Epidemic Intelligence Service officers have extensive experience with community-based health studies involving industrial contamination. Additionally, CDC's statistical resources and computer modeling capabilities would allow for more sophisticated analysis of exposure patterns and health outcomes than our current departmental capacity permits.

Dr. Alan Woolf from CDC's Environmental Health Services Division has already expressed preliminary interest in this case following my informal consultation last month. He indicated that the combination of documented environmental contamination, potential chronic exposure through municipal water supply, and apparent childhood cancer clustering meets their criteria for priority investigation support.

## Recommendation

I recommend that you formally request CDC assistance through their Environmental Health Services Division, specifically requesting assignment of an epidemiologist and environmental health specialist for a minimum six-month collaborative investigation. This partnership would provide the scientific rigor necessary to establish or refute potential causal relationships between the documented water contamination and observed health effects in the affected population.

Given the complexity of the exposure pathways and the fifteen-year operational period of the contaminated wells, this investigation will require resources beyond our current departmental allocation. CDC collaboration would provide both technical expertise and federal funding support for comprehensive health assessments, medical record reviews, and environmental exposure modeling.

The families affected by this situation deserve a thorough and scientifically sound investigation. Our preliminary findings suggest this may represent one of the most significant environmental health incidents in Massachusetts history, with implications extending far beyond the immediate Woburn community.

I am available to discuss this recommendation and assist with preparation of the formal CDC collaboration request at your convenience.
