# WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## Monthly Water Supply Distribution Report - Wells G and H

**TO:** Harold F. Peterson, City Manager  
**FROM:** Robert Dempsey, Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** March 22, 1972  
**RE:** February 1972 Water Distribution Summary - Wells G and H Operations

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive summary of water distribution activities for February 1972, with particular focus on the operational status and output of Wells G and H. During the reporting period, both wells maintained regular operational schedules to meet municipal water demand, with total combined output of 847,300 gallons distributed primarily to residential areas east of Main Street (Route 38).

## Well Operations Summary

### Well G Operations
- **Location:** Intersection of Salem Street and Mishawum Road
- **Depth:** 88 feet
- **February Operating Days:** 18 days
- **Total Output:** 423,150 gallons
- **Average Daily Output:** 23,508 gallons
- **Peak Daily Output:** 31,200 gallons (February 14)
- **Operational Status:** Normal

Well G maintained consistent performance throughout February, with pumping operations conducted on alternate days to manage aquifer drawdown and ensure sustainable water table levels. The well's submersible pump system operated without mechanical issues, and routine maintenance was performed on February 7th including inspection of electrical connections and pump housing.

### Well H Operations
- **Location:** Industrial Avenue near Aberjona River
- **Depth:** 90 feet
- **February Operating Days:** 16 days
- **Total Output:** 424,150 gallons
- **Average Daily Output:** 26,509 gallons
- **Peak Daily Output:** 34,800 gallons (February 21)
- **Operational Status:** Normal

Well H demonstrated slightly higher per-day output capacity during February operations. The well's pumping schedule was coordinated with Well G to optimize distribution pressure throughout the eastern service area. Minor electrical maintenance was completed on February 16th with no impact on service delivery.

## Distribution Network Analysis

The combined output from Wells G and H served approximately 1,847 residential connections in East Woburn during February 1972. Primary service areas included:

- **Pine Street Corridor:** 312 connections
- **Wood Street Neighborhood:** 198 connections
- **Salem Street Residential Area:** 267 connections
- **Mishawum Road District:** 189 connections
- **East Woburn Industrial Area:** 43 connections
- **Scattered Rural Connections:** 838 connections

Water pressure maintained adequate levels throughout the distribution network, with average pressure readings of 42-48 PSI recorded at monitoring stations. No service interruptions were reported during the month, and customer complaints remained minimal with only three inquiries regarding water taste and two regarding water pressure.

## Water Quality Monitoring

Routine water quality testing was conducted according to Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines. Samples were collected from both wellheads and at distribution points throughout the service area on February 3rd, 10th, 17th, and 24th.

**Bacteriological Testing Results:**
- All samples tested negative for coliform bacteria
- pH levels ranged from 6.8 to 7.2 across all sampling points
- Chlorine residual maintained at 0.2-0.4 mg/L throughout distribution system

**Chemical Analysis:**
- Iron content: 0.12-0.18 mg/L (within acceptable limits)
- Hardness: 145-162 mg/L as CaCO3
- Total dissolved solids: 298-312 mg/L
- Turbidity: Less than 1.0 NTU at all sampling points

Water quality parameters remained within established guidelines throughout the reporting period. Some residents in the Wood Street and Salem Street areas have reported occasional taste variations, which we attribute to natural mineral content variations in the aquifer system.

## Infrastructure Maintenance

**Completed Maintenance Activities:**
- Routine pump inspection and lubrication at both wells
- Electrical system testing and connection tightening
- Distribution line pressure testing along Pine Street corridor
- Valve exercise program completed for 23 gate valves in the eastern district

**Scheduled Maintenance:**
- Well G pump motor bearing replacement scheduled for March 15th
- Annual water meter reading program to commence March 1st
- Distribution line flushing program scheduled for April 1-15th

## Financial Summary

**February 1972 Operating Costs:**
- Electrical power consumption: $387.42
- Routine maintenance materials: $156.78
- Water quality testing: $45.00
- Personnel costs (allocated): $1,247.50
- **Total Monthly Operating Cost:** $1,836.70
- **Cost per 1,000 gallons:** $2.17

## Recommendations

1. **Aquifer Management:** Continue alternating pumping schedule between Wells G and H to prevent over-extraction and maintain sustainable water table levels.

2. **Quality Monitoring:** Expand water quality sampling to include additional chemical parameters as recommended by recent Massachusetts DPH guidance, particularly for industrial area monitoring.

3. **Infrastructure Investment:** Consider installation of additional pressure monitoring equipment in the Wood Street and Salem Street neighborhoods to better track distribution system performance.

4. **Emergency Preparedness:** Develop contingency pumping protocols to ensure continued service in the event of single-well failure during peak demand periods.

5. **Customer Communication:** Implement quarterly newsletter to inform residents about water quality testing results and conservation recommendations.

## Conclusion

Wells G and H continue to provide reliable water service to East Woburn residential and commercial customers. Water quality remains within all regulatory standards, and distribution system performance meets municipal service requirements. The combined well system demonstrates adequate capacity to meet current demand while maintaining sustainable aquifer management practices.
