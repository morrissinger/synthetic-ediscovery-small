## INTENDED USE

The chemical solvents specified in this purchase order are required for ongoing manufacturing operations at our Woburn facility. **Trichloroethylene** will be utilized primarily in our vapor degreasing systems for cleaning metal components and machinery used in plastic film production. The degreasing operations are essential for maintaining product quality standards and ensuring proper adhesion in our laminated packaging materials.

**Perchloroethylene** will support precision cleaning operations for sensitive manufacturing equipment, particularly in areas where residue-free surfaces are critical for product integrity. **1,1,1-Trichloroethane** will be used for routine maintenance cleaning of production line components and for removing adhesive residues from manufacturing equipment.

These solvents are integral to our quality control processes and production efficiency. The quantities ordered represent approximately three months of normal consumption based on current production schedules and maintenance requirements.
