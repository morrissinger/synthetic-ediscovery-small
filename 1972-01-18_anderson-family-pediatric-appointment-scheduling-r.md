## APPOINTMENT HISTORY - 1972

**January 18, 1972 - 3:20 PM**  
**Scheduled by:** Mrs. Anne Anderson  
**Reason for Visit:** Follow-up examination, persistent fatigue and bruising  
**Appointment Date:** January 25, 1972 at 2:15 PM  
**Duration:** 45 minutes (extended examination requested)  

**Notes from scheduling call:**  
Mrs. Anderson called this afternoon expressing continued concern about Jimmy's condition. She reports that the bruising on his legs has not improved since our December visit, and she has noticed new bruises appearing on his arms and back without any trauma she can identify. The child continues to complain of being tired, even after full nights of sleep, and has been reluctant to participate in his usual outdoor activities with neighborhood children.

Mrs. Anderson mentioned that Jimmy has been experiencing occasional nosebleeds, particularly in the morning, which she initially attributed to the dry winter air. However, the frequency has increased to 3-4 times per week over the past two weeks. She has also observed that small cuts and scrapes are taking longer than usual to heal.

The mother reports no fever or obvious signs of infection, but notes that Jimmy's appetite has decreased somewhat over the past month. She states he has lost approximately 3-4 pounds since his last visit in December, despite maintaining his normal eating schedule.

**Previous Appointments Referenced:**
- December 14, 1971: Routine physical examination
- October 8, 1971: School physical clearance
- August 22, 1971: Summer camp physical

**Scheduling Notes:**  
Scheduled for Dr. Peterson's earliest available extended appointment slot. Mrs. Anderson specifically requested additional time for thorough examination given the constellation of symptoms. Advised to bring Jimmy's school records showing any attendance issues due to fatigue.

**Insurance Verification:**  
Coverage confirmed active through Anderson Trucking & Supply Co. group plan. Pre-authorization not required for diagnostic examination.

**SCHEDULING STAFF OBSERVATIONS:**

Mrs. Anderson sounded quite concerned during today's call, more so than during previous scheduling conversations. She mentioned that several other mothers in the neighborhood have been discussing similar health concerns with their children, though she did not provide specific details. She asked if Dr. Peterson had noticed any patterns among his young patients in the East Woburn area.

The mother also inquired about whether the recent municipal water taste changes might be related to health issues. She noted that the tap water has had an unusual chemical odor intermittently over the past several months, particularly when Wells G and H are in operation. She asked if this was something Dr. Peterson might want to discuss during Jimmy's examination.

**Follow-up Required:**  
- Prepare Jimmy's complete medical file for Dr. Peterson's review prior to appointment
- Note Mrs. Anderson's questions about neighborhood health patterns and water quality for discussion
- Ensure laboratory requisition forms are available if blood work is indicated
- Schedule follow-up appointment availability for the week following January 25th examination

**Next Appointment:** January 25, 1972 at 2:15 PM  
**Scheduled by:** Margaret O'Brien, Scheduling Secretary  
**Confirmed with:** Mrs. Anne Anderson
