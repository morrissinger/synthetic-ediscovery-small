## BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION

This substantial chemical solvent order represents a significant expansion of our tanning and leather finishing operations to meet increased demand from military and commercial contracts. Our production capacity has grown substantially over the past two years, requiring enhanced chemical processing capabilities for hide preparation, degreasing operations, and finishing treatments.

The trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene will be utilized primarily in our new vapor degreasing system installed in Building C, which provides superior cleaning of leather goods prior to final finishing. Carbon tetrachloride serves as our primary solvent for spot cleaning and stain removal operations throughout the production process. Methylene chloride is essential for our paint stripping operations on leather goods requiring refinishing or color changes.

The benzene and toluene will be incorporated into our custom solvent blends used in the leather softening and conditioning processes, particularly for our premium leather lines destined for automotive and furniture applications. These chemicals enable us to achieve the consistent quality standards demanded by our growing customer base.

Our expanded chemical inventory will be stored in accordance with standard industrial practices in our designated chemical storage building, constructed with concrete floors and adequate drainage systems. Waste solvents will continue to be managed through our established disposal procedures, including on-site treatment where feasible and off-site disposal for materials requiring specialized handling.

This order reflects our commitment to maintaining the John J. Riley Company's position as a leading leather manufacturer in the Massachusetts industrial corridor, while ensuring we have adequate chemical supplies to meet production demands through the remainder of 1953 and into early 1954.
