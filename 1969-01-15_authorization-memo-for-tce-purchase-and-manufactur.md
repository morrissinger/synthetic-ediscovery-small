# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Cryovac Purchasing Department  
**FROM:** Robert K. Matthews, Operations Manager  
**DATE:** January 15, 1969  
**RE:** Authorization for Trichloroethylene (TCE) Purchase and Manufacturing Use

## Purpose

This memo serves to authorize the immediate procurement of industrial-grade trichloroethylene (TCE) for use in our East Woburn manufacturing operations. Based on our current production schedules and inventory analysis, we require an initial order of 15,000 gallons to meet Q1 1969 manufacturing demands for our food packaging film production lines.

## Operational Requirements

Our shrink-wrap film manufacturing process requires consistent degreasing and cleaning of production equipment to maintain product quality standards. TCE has proven highly effective as a degreasing solvent in our operations, particularly for cleaning the metal rollers and heating elements in Lines 3 through 7. The chemical's rapid evaporation rate and excellent degreasing properties make it ideal for our high-volume production environment where equipment turnaround time is critical.

Engineering has confirmed that TCE usage at our current rates of approximately 200-300 gallons per week will allow us to maintain production efficiency while meeting our delivery commitments to major food packaging clients. The solvent will be stored in our existing chemical storage area adjacent to the main production floor, utilizing the current ventilation and containment systems already in place for our other industrial solvents.

## Procurement Authorization

You are hereby authorized to proceed with the following procurement:

- **Product:** Industrial Grade Trichloroethylene (TCE), 99.5% purity minimum
- **Quantity:** 15,000 gallons initial order
- **Delivery:** Standard 55-gallon drums, delivered to East Woburn facility
- **Timeline:** Delivery required by February 1, 1969
- **Budget Authorization:** Not to exceed $8,500 for initial order
- **Supplier Preference:** Continue with Dow Chemical Company as primary supplier, with Monsanto Chemical as secondary option

## Handling and Storage Protocols

All TCE deliveries should be directed to our designated chemical receiving area on the north side of the facility. Our maintenance crew has been instructed on proper handling procedures, and all storage will comply with current industrial safety standards. Used solvent and cleaning residues will be managed through our existing waste disposal contractor, who has confirmed capacity to handle the additional volume through their established disposal methods.

Please coordinate delivery scheduling with Plant Supervisor William Harrison to ensure proper receiving and storage. Any questions regarding this authorization should be directed to my office.
