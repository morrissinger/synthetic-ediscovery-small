# WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY QUALITY REPORT

**Report Date:** October 25, 1970  
**Sample Location:** Henry Avenue Distribution System  
**Sample Collection Date:** October 15, 1970  
**Laboratory Analysis Completed:** October 22, 1970  
**Report Number:** WWD-70-284

---

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Woburn Water Department has completed routine water quality testing for the municipal water supply serving the Henry Avenue residential area in East Woburn. This report presents the results of chemical and bacteriological analysis conducted on water samples collected from the distribution system on October 15, 1970. The testing was performed in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines and federal water quality standards.

Water samples were collected from the distribution system serving Henry Avenue and surrounding streets in East Woburn, which receives water from Wells G and H when these supplemental sources are in operation. The wells, located at depths of 88 and 90 feet respectively, draw from the Aberjona River watershed aquifer system.

### SAMPLE COLLECTION METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected by certified Water Department personnel using sterile collection procedures. Samples were taken from the following locations:

- **Primary Sample Point:** 47 Henry Avenue (residential tap)
- **Secondary Sample Point:** Distribution main at Henry Avenue/Wood Street intersection
- **Control Sample:** Main distribution system (Wells A, B, C supply)

All samples were collected in sterile glass containers and transported to the laboratory within four hours of collection. Chain of custody procedures were maintained throughout the sampling and analysis process.

### BACTERIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

**Standard Plate Count (colonies per ml):**
- Henry Avenue residence: 12 colonies/ml
- Distribution main: 8 colonies/ml
- Control sample: 6 colonies/ml

**Coliform Test Results:**
- Total coliforms: Negative
- Fecal coliforms: Negative

**Analysis:** Bacteriological results are within acceptable limits established by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. No evidence of bacterial contamination was detected in any of the samples tested.

### CHEMICAL ANALYSIS

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Color: 5 units (acceptable range: 0-15 units)
- Odor: Threshold odor number 2 (acceptable range: 0-3)
- Turbidity: 0.8 units (acceptable range: 0-1.0 units)
- pH: 7.2 (acceptable range: 6.5-8.5)

**Inorganic Chemical Analysis (mg/L):**
- Chloride: 18.5 mg/L
- Sulfate: 24.2 mg/L
- Total dissolved solids: 142 mg/L
- Hardness (as CaCO3): 68 mg/L
- Iron: 0.12 mg/L
- Manganese: 0.04 mg/L
- Fluoride: 0.8 mg/L

**Heavy Metals Analysis (mg/L):**
- Lead: Less than 0.01 mg/L
- Copper: 0.08 mg/L
- Zinc: 0.15 mg/L

**Note:** Organic chemical analysis was not performed as part of this routine testing protocol. Current Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines do not require regular testing for organic compounds in municipal water supplies.

### FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

The water quality analysis indicates that the municipal water supply serving the Henry Avenue area meets all current state and federal standards for potable water. All measured parameters fall within acceptable ranges established by regulatory authorities.

The slight elevation in standard plate count at the Henry Avenue residence (12 colonies/ml) compared to the control sample (6 colonies/ml) is not considered significant and remains well within acceptable limits. This minor variation is typical of distribution system samples and does not indicate any contamination concerns.

Physical characteristics of the water, including color, odor, and turbidity, are all within normal ranges. The pH level of 7.2 indicates the water is neither acidic nor alkaline, falling comfortably within the acceptable range.

Chemical analysis reveals typical groundwater characteristics for the Woburn area. Chloride and sulfate levels are moderate and consistent with natural groundwater chemistry. Total dissolved solids are within acceptable limits, indicating good overall water quality.

Heavy metals testing shows all measured metals at levels well below maximum allowable concentrations. Lead content is below the detection limit of 0.01 mg/L, which is particularly important for public health protection.

### WATER SOURCE INFORMATION

The Henry Avenue area receives water from the municipal distribution system, which draws from multiple well sources including Wells A, B, and C (primary sources) and Wells G and H (supplemental sources). Wells G and H, commissioned in 1964 and 1966 respectively, are utilized during periods of high demand or when primary wells require maintenance.

Wells G and H draw from an aquifer at depths of 88 and 90 feet, tapping groundwater from the Aberjona River watershed. These wells are equipped with standard pumping equipment and chlorination systems to ensure water quality meets municipal standards.

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

This water quality report demonstrates compliance with:

- **Massachusetts Department of Public Health** drinking water standards
- **U.S. Public Health Service** drinking water standards
- **Federal Water Pollution Control Act** requirements

All testing procedures followed established protocols, and results have been submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health as required by state regulations.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of this analysis, the Woburn Water Department recommends:

1. **Continued Monitoring:** Maintain regular water quality testing schedule in accordance with state requirements
2. **Distribution System Maintenance:** Continue routine maintenance of distribution lines to prevent contamination
3. **Well Source Management:** Monitor performance of all well sources, including Wells G and H, to ensure consistent water quality
4. **Public Information:** Continue providing water quality information to residents as part of our commitment to public health

### CERTIFICATION

This report has been prepared under the supervision of qualified personnel and represents accurate analysis of water samples collected from the Henry Avenue distribution system on the date specified. Laboratory analysis was conducted using standard methods approved by the American Water Works Association and the American Public Health Association.
