# WOBURN WATER DEPARTMENT
## OPERATIONAL ORDER

**TO:** Water Department Operations Staff  
**FROM:** Robert F. McCarthy, Superintendent  
**DATE:** March 18, 1969  
**RE:** Activation of Wells G and H for Peak Demand Supply

---

### IMMEDIATE ACTIVATION REQUIRED

Effective immediately, Wells G and H are to be brought online to supplement our primary water supply system. Recent demand projections and current consumption patterns indicate we will exceed capacity of our main distribution system during peak usage periods over the next several weeks.

**Operational Parameters:**
- Well G: Activate at 0800 hours daily, maintain 450 GPM flow rate
- Well H: Activate at 0800 hours daily, maintain 525 GPM flow rate
- Combined output to supply approximately 35% of total municipal demand
- Primary distribution to East Woburn residential areas via Maple Street and Pleasant Street mains

### DISTRIBUTION ZONES

Wells G and H will provide primary water service to the following residential areas:
- All homes east of Main Street (Route 38)
- Wood Street residential district
- Pine Street neighborhood
- Salem Street corridor
- Sections of Pleasant Street and connecting residential streets

This distribution pattern ensures adequate pressure and volume for approximately 850 residential connections in the eastern portion of our service area.

### OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

**Daily Operations:**
1. Conduct morning system pressure checks at 0730 hours
2. Activate both wells simultaneously at 0800 hours
3. Monitor flow rates and pressure readings every two hours
4. Record daily output volumes in operations log
5. Conduct evening system shutdown at 2200 hours

**Weekly Maintenance:**
- Inspect pump housing and electrical connections
- Test emergency shutdown procedures
- Submit weekly operational reports to Superintendent's office
- Coordinate with Massachusetts Department of Public Health for any required testing protocols

### WATER QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS

Wells G and H have been tested and approved for municipal use in accordance with state health department standards. The wells draw from the Aberjona River aquifer at depths of 88 feet (Well G) and 90 feet (Well H), providing access to groundwater resources that supplement our primary surface water sources.

**Quality Assurance:**
- Monthly bacterial testing as required by state regulations
- Quarterly chemical analysis through approved laboratory
- Maintain detailed records of all testing results
- Report any unusual taste, odor, or appearance immediately

### EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

In the event of equipment failure or water quality concerns:
1. Immediately shut down affected well
2. Notify Superintendent's office
3. Implement backup supply procedures
4. Contact Massachusetts Department of Public Health if water quality issues are suspected

### COMMUNITY IMPACT

This activation will ensure reliable water service to growing residential areas in East Woburn. The wells represent a significant investment in our municipal infrastructure and will provide essential water security for families throughout the eastern service district. Population growth in these neighborhoods, particularly along Wood Street and surrounding residential areas, necessitates this supplemental supply capacity.

**Service Area Demographics:**
- Approximately 850 residential connections
- Estimated 2,800 residents served
- Mix of established families and new homeowners
- Growing number of young families with children

### REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Submit daily operational logs to the Superintendent's office by 0900 hours each morning. Include:
- Total gallons pumped from each well
- System pressure readings
- Any maintenance activities performed
- Unusual observations or incidents

Weekly summary reports due each Friday by 1600 hours, including:
- Total weekly production volumes
- Equipment performance assessments
- Maintenance schedule compliance
- Recommendations for operational improvements

### COORDINATION WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS

**Public Works Department:** Coordinate any street work that might affect water main integrity in the East Woburn service area.

**Health Department:** Maintain communication regarding any resident complaints about water quality, taste, or odor.

**Fire Department:** Ensure adequate pressure maintained for fire protection services in the Wells G and H service areas.

### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Operational costs for Wells G and H activation are covered under the current fiscal year water department budget. Estimated monthly operating costs:
- Electrical power: $280
- Maintenance supplies: $125  
- Testing and analysis: $95
- Personnel time: $340

Total monthly operational cost: $840

### LONG-TERM PLANNING

Wells G and H are expected to remain in regular service to meet growing demand in East Woburn. Future considerations include:
- Potential expansion of pumping capacity
- Additional distribution main connections
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- Integration with planned municipal water system improvements

This activation order remains in effect until further notice. Any questions regarding these operational procedures should be directed to the Superintendent's office immediately.
