City Hall Annex  
10 Common Street  
Woburn, Massachusetts 01801

**TO:** Robert J. McCarthy, City Manager  
**FROM:** Frank Morrison, Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** October 3, 1969  
**RE:** September 1969 Water Production and Quality Assessment - Wells G and H

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents September 1969 operational data for municipal Wells G and H, including production volumes, operational hours, and routine water quality parameters. Both wells maintained consistent output throughout the reporting period, with Well G producing 847,200 gallons and Well H producing 1,124,800 gallons during active pumping periods.

## PRODUCTION DATA

### Well G (Installed 1964, Depth: 88 feet)
- **Total September Production:** 847,200 gallons
- **Operating Days:** 18 days
- **Average Daily Production:** 47,067 gallons
- **Peak Daily Production:** 62,400 gallons (September 15)
- **Pump Operating Hours:** 432 hours
- **Average Flow Rate:** 1,962 gallons per hour

### Well H (Installed 1966, Depth: 90 feet)
- **Total September Production:** 1,124,800 gallons
- **Operating Days:** 22 days
- **Average Daily Production:** 51,127 gallons
- **Peak Daily Production:** 67,200 gallons (September 23)
- **Pump Operating Hours:** 528 hours
- **Average Flow Rate:** 2,131 gallons per hour

### Combined System Performance
- **Total Wells G & H Production:** 1,972,000 gallons
- **Percentage of Municipal Supply:** 34.7%
- **Primary Service Area:** East Woburn residential districts
- **Distribution Pressure:** Maintained at 45-50 PSI throughout system

## OPERATIONAL SCHEDULE

Wells G and H operated on an alternating supplemental basis during September, activated primarily during peak demand periods (6:00 AM - 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM - 9:00 PM) and during maintenance periods at the primary treatment facility on Montvale Avenue. Both wells demonstrated reliable startup and shutdown performance with no mechanical issues reported.

**Notable Operational Events:**
- September 8-10: Well G offline for routine pump maintenance
- September 15-16: Both wells operated continuously due to high residential demand
- September 23: Well H achieved maximum monthly output during system stress test

## WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS

Routine testing conducted in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations revealed the following results for samples collected September 25, 1969:

### Physical Characteristics
- **Color:** Well G - 5 units, Well H - 8 units (Standard: <15 units)
- **Turbidity:** Well G - 0.3 NTU, Well H - 0.4 NTU (Standard: <1.0 NTU)
- **Odor:** Both wells - None detected
- **Taste:** Both wells - No objectionable taste reported

### Chemical Analysis
- **pH:** Well G - 6.8, Well H - 6.9 (Acceptable range: 6.5-8.5)
- **Total Hardness:** Well G - 142 mg/L, Well H - 156 mg/L (as CaCO₃)
- **Iron:** Well G - 0.08 mg/L, Well H - 0.12 mg/L (Standard: <0.3 mg/L)
- **Manganese:** Well G - 0.02 mg/L, Well H - 0.03 mg/L (Standard: <0.05 mg/L)
- **Chloride:** Well G - 18 mg/L, Well H - 22 mg/L (Standard: <250 mg/L)
- **Total Dissolved Solids:** Well G - 285 mg/L, Well H - 312 mg/L (Standard: <500 mg/L)

### Bacteriological Testing
- **Total Coliform:** Both wells - Negative
- **E. coli:** Both wells - Not detected
- **Standard Plate Count:** Well G - 12 CFU/mL, Well H - 8 CFU/mL

All bacteriological samples collected from distribution points in the East Woburn service area on September 28, 1969, showed negative results for coliform bacteria.

## AQUIFER CONDITIONS

Groundwater levels in the Aberjona River watershed remain stable following the summer dry period. Static water levels measured on September 30 showed:
- **Well G:** 12.3 feet below ground surface
- **Well H:** 11.8 feet below ground surface

These levels represent normal seasonal recovery and indicate adequate aquifer recharge from recent precipitation. Drawdown during pumping operations remained within acceptable parameters, with maximum observed drawdown of 8.2 feet at Well G and 7.6 feet at Well H during peak production periods.

## DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE

The East Woburn distribution network, serving approximately 1,847 residential connections, maintained adequate pressure and flow throughout September. Pressure monitoring at key distribution points recorded:
- **Wood Street/Olympia Avenue:** 48 PSI average
- **Salem Street/Cross Street:** 46 PSI average  
- **Washington Street/Montvale Avenue:** 52 PSI average

No customer complaints regarding water pressure, taste, or odor were received during the reporting period.

## MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES

### Completed Work
- September 8: Well G pump inspection and bearing lubrication
- September 12: Well H electrical connections inspection
- September 20: Both wells - chlorination system calibration
- September 25: Water quality sampling and laboratory submission

### Scheduled Maintenance
- October 15: Quarterly aquifer yield testing (both wells)
- October 30: Annual pump efficiency evaluation
- November 5: Distribution system flushing (East Woburn sector)

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

All September 1969 operations and water quality results comply with current Massachusetts Department of Public Health drinking water standards (310 CMR 22.00). Required monthly bacteriological samples were collected and analyzed by the state-certified laboratory at Northeastern University. Results have been forwarded to the MDPH Division of Water Supply as required.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Continue Current Operating Schedule:** The alternating supplemental operation of Wells G and H provides effective system redundancy while managing aquifer drawdown.

2. **Monitor Seasonal Demand Patterns:** October typically shows increased residential consumption; recommend standby activation protocols for both wells during peak periods.

3. **Aquifer Protection:** Consider establishing monitoring protocols for potential contamination sources in the watershed area, particularly given the proximity of industrial facilities along the Aberjona River corridor.

4. **Infrastructure Assessment:** Schedule comprehensive evaluation of distribution mains in the East Woburn service area, with particular attention to sections installed prior to 1955.
