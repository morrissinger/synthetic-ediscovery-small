# W.R. GRACE COMPANY
## INCIDENT REPORT

**TO:** Thomas P. Sullivan, Plant Safety Manager  
**FROM:** Robert J. Mitchell, Production Supervisor  
**DATE:** January 14, 1976  
**RE:** Chemical Spill Incident - Production Area B  
**INCIDENT NO:** WRG-76-014  

### INCIDENT SUMMARY

At approximately 0630 hours on January 14, 1976, a containment failure occurred in Production Area B resulting in the release of approximately 150 gallons of industrial solvent mixture onto the production floor and adjacent staging area. The spill consisted primarily of trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) used in our Cryovac division manufacturing processes. Immediate containment measures were implemented by shift personnel under my supervision.

### INCIDENT DETAILS

**Location:** Production Area B, Building 3, W.R. Grace Woburn Facility  
**Time of Discovery:** 0630 hours  
**Weather Conditions:** Clear, temperature 28°F  
**Personnel Present:** J. Morrison (operator), R. Kowalski (maintenance), D. Chen (quality control)  

The incident occurred when operator Morrison was conducting routine transfer operations from storage tank T-47 to production vessel V-12. During the transfer process, a gasket failure in the 4-inch transfer line resulted in solvent discharge onto the concrete floor. Morrison immediately shut down the transfer pump and activated the emergency containment protocol. The spill area measured approximately 20 feet by 15 feet, with some material flowing toward the floor drain system in the northeast corner of the production area.

### IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACTIONS

Upon discovery of the spill, the following actions were taken:

1. **Shutdown Procedures:** All transfer operations in Area B were immediately halted and electrical equipment was secured to prevent ignition sources.

2. **Personnel Safety:** The three personnel present in the area were evacuated to the upwind assembly point. No personnel reported exposure symptoms during or immediately following the incident.

3. **Containment Efforts:** Maintenance personnel deployed absorbent materials from the emergency response station. Approximately 40 bags of industrial absorbent were utilized to contain the spread of material.

4. **Ventilation:** Building ventilation systems were adjusted to maximum exhaust to minimize vapor accumulation in the work area.

### MATERIAL RECOVERY

Recovery operations commenced at 0800 hours after area ventilation and safety assessment. The contaminated absorbent materials were collected and placed in approved waste containers for disposal through our contracted waste management service, Yankee Environmental Services. Approximately 85% of the spilled material was recovered through absorption methods. The remaining material had penetrated the concrete floor surface or entered the floor drain system.

### FLOOR DRAIN ASSESSMENT

The Production Area B floor drains connect to our internal collection system, which ultimately discharges to the municipal system after passing through our settling ponds located on the south side of the property. Visual inspection of the drain system showed evidence of solvent residue, though the quantity that entered the drainage system could not be precisely determined. Our maintenance department will conduct a thorough flushing of the drain lines using industrial degreasing agents.

### EQUIPMENT INSPECTION

Post-incident inspection revealed that the gasket failure was due to degradation of the rubber sealing material, likely caused by prolonged exposure to the solvent mixture. The gasket had been installed during the last scheduled maintenance cycle in September 1975. Maintenance records indicate this represents normal service life for gaskets in solvent service, though we will review our preventive maintenance schedule to determine if more frequent replacement is warranted.

The transfer line and associated fittings showed no other signs of deterioration or damage. Tank T-47 and vessel V-12 were inspected and found to be in satisfactory condition.

### ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

While the majority of the spilled material was contained and recovered, some quantity did enter our drainage system and may have reached the settling ponds. Our standard operating procedures call for periodic testing of pond water, though specific testing for this incident has not yet been conducted. The settling ponds are designed to contain industrial runoff before discharge, and we maintain appropriate permits for our discharge activities.

The proximity of municipal Wells G and H, located approximately 1,500 feet northeast of our facility, has been noted in our environmental assessments. However, our understanding based on hydrogeological surveys is that groundwater flow patterns in this area move generally eastward toward the Aberjona River, away from the well locations.

### REGULATORY NOTIFICATIONS

Per company policy, this incident will be reported to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering within the required timeframe. The estimated quantity and nature of the release falls below federal reporting thresholds, though we will review EPA notification requirements to ensure full compliance.

### CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

The following corrective measures have been implemented or are planned:

1. **Immediate:** Replacement of all gaskets in the Area B transfer system with upgraded chemical-resistant materials.

2. **Short-term:** Review and revision of preventive maintenance schedules for solvent handling equipment to reduce gasket replacement intervals from 6 months to 4 months.

3. **Long-term:** Engineering assessment of secondary containment options for Area B transfer operations to prevent future floor contamination.

### PERSONNEL ACTIONS

No disciplinary action is recommended regarding this incident. Operator Morrison followed proper procedures for spill response and notification. The equipment failure appears to be due to normal wear rather than operational error or maintenance deficiency.

All personnel involved in the response will receive refresher training on emergency procedures within 30 days. Additionally, we will review our emergency response supplies to ensure adequate quantities of absorbent materials are maintained.

### COST ESTIMATE

Preliminary cost estimates for this incident include:

- Absorbent materials and disposal: $850
- Replacement gaskets and maintenance labor: $320
- Lost production time (4 hours): $1,200
- Environmental assessment and reporting: $500

**Total estimated cost: $2,870**

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Accelerate the planned upgrade of Area B transfer systems to include secondary containment features.

2. Install additional spill response equipment stations in production areas handling large quantities of solvents.

3. Consider implementation of continuous monitoring systems for critical transfer operations.

4. Review insurance coverage for environmental incidents to ensure adequate protection.

### CONCLUSION

While this incident resulted in a significant release of industrial solvents, the prompt response by operations personnel minimized the extent of contamination and prevented any immediate safety hazards. The containment and recovery efforts were effective in limiting the environmental impact, though some material did enter our drainage system.

This incident highlights the ongoing challenges of handling industrial solvents in our manufacturing processes and reinforces the need for continued investment in equipment upgrades and maintenance procedures. The corrective actions outlined above should significantly reduce the likelihood of similar occurrences in the future.

I will continue to monitor the implementation of corrective measures and provide updates as appropriate. Please contact me if you require additional information or clarification regarding any aspect of this incident.
