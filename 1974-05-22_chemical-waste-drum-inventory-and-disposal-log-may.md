## OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Drum Storage Optimization:** Consider consolidation of Area B and Area C storage to improve handling efficiency and reduce exposure time.

2. **Disposal Scheduling:** Implement weekly disposal schedule to reduce on-site inventory and minimize storage duration.

3. **Equipment Maintenance:** Schedule quarterly inspection of burial equipment to ensure proper excavation depths and soil coverage.

4. **Personnel Safety:** Continue monthly safety briefings on chemical handling procedures and protective equipment requirements.

5. **Monitoring Enhancement:** Consider installation of additional groundwater monitoring well at southwest property boundary to improve coverage.
