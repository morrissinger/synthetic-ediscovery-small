# Well G Drilling Operations Commencement Report
## Aberjona River Site

**TO:** Director, Department of Public Works  
**FROM:** Municipal Contractor - Site Operations Team  
**DATE:** March 22, 1964  
**RE:** Commencement of Well G Drilling Operations - East Woburn Water Supply Expansion

### Executive Summary

This report documents the initiation of drilling operations for Well G, located in the eastern section of Woburn, Massachusetts, as part of the municipal water supply expansion project authorized under City Council Resolution 64-WS-07. Operations commenced at 0800 hours on March 22, 1964, with completion anticipated within 14-21 days pending geological conditions and weather.

### Site Location and Specifications

**Site Coordinates:** Approximately 500 feet east of the Aberjona River, adjacent to the existing municipal easement  
**Property Description:** City-owned parcel, Lot 47-B, East Woburn District  
**Target Depth:** 88 feet to penetrate primary aquifer layer  
**Well Diameter:** 12-inch casing with 8-inch production casing  
**Estimated Capacity:** 400-600 gallons per minute based on preliminary geological surveys

The selected location represents optimal positioning within the Aberjona River watershed to access the deep north-south trending bedrock aquifer system. Site selection was based on the 1963 hydrogeological survey conducted by Whitman & Associates, which identified this location as having the highest probability of sustained yield while maintaining adequate distance from existing residential structures.

### Drilling Methodology and Equipment

**Primary Contractor:** Acme Well Drilling Company, Billerica, MA  
**Equipment Deployed:**
- Ingersoll-Rand T-4W rotary drilling rig
- 12-inch steel surface casing (20 feet)
- 8-inch steel production casing (full depth)
- Centrifugal mud pump system
- Bentonite drilling mud for stabilization

Drilling operations utilize standard rotary drilling techniques with bentonite mud circulation to maintain borehole stability and prevent contamination during the drilling process. All equipment has been inspected and certified in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations for municipal water well construction.

### Geological Conditions and Initial Findings

**Surface Layer (0-15 feet):** Sandy loam with organic matter, consistent with Aberjona River floodplain deposits  
**Secondary Layer (15-35 feet):** Dense clay and silt layer, providing natural protective barrier  
**Tertiary Layer (35-65 feet):** Mixed sand and gravel deposits with increasing permeability  
**Target Aquifer (65-88 feet):** Coarse sand and gravel formation with excellent water-bearing characteristics

Initial drilling has proceeded according to specifications with no unexpected geological conditions encountered. Water table was reached at approximately 22 feet below surface, consistent with regional groundwater monitoring data. The protective clay layer at intermediate depths provides natural filtration and protection for the underlying aquifer system.

### Water Quality and Testing Protocols

Preliminary water samples will be collected at 24-hour intervals once the target depth is achieved and initial development is completed. All samples will be submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health laboratory in Boston for comprehensive analysis including:

- Bacterial contamination testing (coliform count)
- Chemical analysis (pH, dissolved solids, hardness)
- Heavy metals screening (iron, manganese, copper)
- Nitrate and chloride levels
- Turbidity and color assessment

Standard protocols require a minimum of three consecutive satisfactory test results before the well can be approved for municipal service. The City's consulting engineer, Robert Harrison, P.E., will oversee all testing and certification procedures.

### Environmental and Safety Considerations

All drilling operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations. Environmental protection measures include:

- Containment of drilling fluids and cuttings
- Proper disposal of waste materials at approved facilities
- Monitoring of nearby surface water for any impacts
- Dust control measures during dry weather operations

Safety protocols include establishment of a 50-foot exclusion zone around active drilling operations, posting of appropriate warning signs, and daily safety briefings for all personnel. No public access issues have been identified, as the site is located on municipal property with existing access controls.

### Schedule and Anticipated Completion

**Phase 1 - Drilling to Target Depth:** March 22-28, 1964  
**Phase 2 - Casing Installation and Grouting:** March 29-31, 1964  
**Phase 3 - Well Development and Pump Testing:** April 1-5, 1964  
**Phase 4 - Water Quality Testing and Certification:** April 6-12, 1964  
**Phase 5 - Pump House Construction and Equipment Installation:** April 13-30, 1964

Weather conditions remain favorable for continued operations. The mild winter and early spring conditions have allowed for optimal site access and equipment positioning. Barring unforeseen complications, Well G should be operational and integrated into the municipal water distribution system by May 1, 1964.

### Integration with Existing Water System

Well G is designed as a supplemental water source to serve the growing demands of East Woburn residents, particularly those east of Main Street (Route 38). The well will connect to the existing distribution main via a new 12-inch transmission line extending approximately 1,200 feet to the intersection of Salem Street and Montvale Avenue.

Initial operating parameters call for Well G to provide supplemental capacity during peak demand periods, with primary service continuing from the existing Wells A, B, and C located in the western portion of the city. This configuration will provide enhanced system reliability and improved pressure maintenance for the eastern service area.

The new well is expected to serve approximately 2,500 residents in the immediate East Woburn area, with capacity for future growth as residential development continues in this section of the city. Engineering analysis indicates the aquifer system can sustain the planned withdrawal rates without adverse impact on neighboring private wells or the regional groundwater system.

### Recommendations and Next Steps

1. Continue drilling operations as scheduled, maintaining close monitoring of geological conditions
2. Implement comprehensive water quality testing protocol upon completion of well development
3. Coordinate with Massachusetts Department of Public Health for expedited review and approval
4. Begin preparation of pump house foundation during well completion phase
5. Schedule public information meeting for East Woburn residents prior to system activation

This expansion of Woburn's municipal water supply represents a significant investment in the community's infrastructure and public health protection. Well G will provide reliable, high-quality water service to meet the growing needs of our expanding residential population while maintaining the high standards of water quality that our citizens expect and deserve.
