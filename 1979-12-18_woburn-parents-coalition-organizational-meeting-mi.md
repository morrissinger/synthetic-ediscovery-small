## Call to Order

Meeting called to order at 7:35 PM by Anne Anderson. Anne opened by stating the purpose of tonight's gathering: to organize concerned parents and community members in response to the alarming cluster of childhood leukemia cases in East Woburn and the recent closure of municipal Wells G and H.

## Background Discussion

### Water Well Closure
Anne Anderson reported that Wells G and H were permanently closed by the City of Woburn in May 1979 following testing that revealed contamination with industrial chemicals, including trichloroethylene and other volatile organic compounds. These wells had been serving East Woburn neighborhoods since 1964 and 1966 respectively. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health confirmed the contamination but has provided limited information to affected families.

### Childhood Leukemia Cases
The group reviewed the documented cases of childhood leukemia in East Woburn:
- **James Anderson** (son of Anne and Robert Anderson) - diagnosed 1972, deceased 1976
- **Kevin Kane Jr.** - diagnosed 1973, ongoing treatment
- **Michael Zona** - diagnosed 1974, ongoing treatment  
- **Patrick Toomey** - diagnosed 1975, ongoing treatment
- **Carl Robbins III** - diagnosed 1976, ongoing treatment
- **Roland Gamache** - diagnosed 1977, ongoing treatment

Dr. Murphy noted that the statistical probability of six childhood leukemia cases occurring in such a concentrated geographic area within a five-year period is extraordinarily low under normal circumstances.

## Industrial Activities Discussion

### W.R. Grace Company/Cryovac
The group discussed the industrial operations at 369 Washington Street, operated by Cryovac Inc., a subsidiary of W.R. Grace Company. Several attendees reported observing:
- Chemical odors emanating from the facility
- Discolored soil and vegetation on company property
- Unusual dumping activities, particularly during evening hours
- Storage of chemical drums in outdoor areas

### Beatrice Foods/Riley Tannery
Discussion of the John J. Riley Company tannery at 228 Salem Street, owned by Beatrice Foods Inc. Community observations included:
- Strong chemical odors from tanning operations
- Discharge of colored water into nearby drainage
- Large quantities of chemical waste containers
- Disposal activities on the adjacent undeveloped property

## Legal Considerations

Rev. Young advised that the coalition should maintain detailed records of all activities and communications. Robert Anderson noted that potential legal claims might include negligence in waste disposal practices, failure to warn of health hazards, and wrongful death in cases where children have died. The group agreed that any legal action would need to establish clear causation between industrial contamination and health impacts.
