The assessment covers disposal areas utilized between 1964-1968 for industrial solvents including trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and related chlorinated compounds used in manufacturing operations. Observations indicate established disposal patterns in designated areas of the facility property with consideration for operational efficiency and regulatory compliance under existing Massachusetts industrial waste guidelines.

## INTRODUCTION

The W.R. Grace Company Woburn facility has maintained chemical manufacturing operations since 1960, producing specialized chemical products and industrial solvents for commercial distribution. As part of routine environmental documentation requirements, this survey examines current practices for disposal of empty and partially used solvent containers, with particular attention to areas designated for waste chemical storage and disposal activities.

The facility operates under Massachusetts Department of Public Health industrial permits and maintains disposal practices consistent with standard industry procedures for chemical manufacturing facilities of comparable size and production capacity. This assessment documents current site conditions and disposal methodologies as of March 1968.

## SITE DESCRIPTION

The W.R. Grace facility encompasses approximately 15 acres of industrial property located in the eastern section of Woburn, Massachusetts. The property is bounded by Washington Street to the west, with the Aberjona River watershed located approximately 800 yards to the east. The facility sits on relatively flat terrain with gentle slopes toward the southeast, characteristic of the glacial deposits common to this region of eastern Massachusetts.

**Soil Composition:** Sandy loam with clay substrata at depths of 8-12 feet  
**Drainage:** Natural surface drainage toward southeast, seasonal high water table at approximately 6-8 feet  
**Vegetation:** Mixed deciduous and coniferous trees along property boundaries, maintained industrial grounds within facility perimeter  
**Proximity to Water Sources:** Aberjona River system 800 yards east, municipal water infrastructure present along Washington Street

## METHODOLOGY

Visual inspection of designated disposal areas was conducted during daylight hours on March 19, 1968. Assessment included examination of container storage areas, waste solvent disposal sites, and general facility grounds related to chemical waste management activities.

**Areas Examined:**
- Primary container storage area (Building 3 rear loading dock)
- Secondary disposal site (southeastern property boundary)
- Temporary storage area (northeast facility grounds)
- Loading and unloading zones for chemical transport

**Documentation Methods:**
- Visual observation and notation
- Photographic documentation (black and white, 35mm)
- Measurement of disposal areas using standard surveying equipment
- Collection of representative soil samples for internal analysis

## OBSERVATIONS AND FINDINGS

### Container Storage and Disposal Practices

The facility maintains established procedures for handling empty and partially used solvent containers. Primary storage occurs in the rear loading area of Building 3, where containers are segregated by chemical type and disposal requirements. Empty containers showing residual solvent content are temporarily stored prior to disposal according to facility protocols.

**Container Types Observed:**
- 55-gallon steel drums (trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene)
- 30-gallon steel containers (mixed chlorinated solvents)
- 5-gallon metal cans (specialty chemical products)
- Various smaller containers (1-gallon and smaller volumes)

### Disposal Site Conditions

The primary disposal area is located in the southeastern section of facility property, approximately 200 yards from the main manufacturing buildings. This area has been utilized for disposal of empty containers and associated chemical wastes since facility operations began in 1960.

**Site Characteristics:**
- Cleared area approximately 100 feet by 150 feet
- Natural depression providing containment for disposal materials
- Periodic covering with soil and industrial fill material
- Access maintained via existing facility roadways

**Current Inventory:** Estimated 200-300 empty containers of various sizes, some showing evidence of residual chemical content. Containers are primarily steel construction with standard industrial markings indicating previous contents.

### Soil and Surface Conditions

Visual examination of disposal area soils indicates normal industrial site conditions with some discoloration consistent with chemical manufacturing operations. Surface soils show evidence of periodic disturbance from disposal activities and equipment access.

**Soil Observations:**
- Surface layer: Mixed industrial fill and native soils
- Coloration: Brown to dark brown with occasional darker patches
- Texture: Sandy composition with clay components
- Moisture: Consistent with seasonal conditions for March

**Vegetation:** Limited vegetation growth within disposal area boundaries, consistent with industrial site utilization. Surrounding areas show normal vegetation patterns for early spring conditions.
