# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Environmental Affairs Department  
**FROM:** Robert F. Hartwell, Facility Manager  
**DATE:** June 13, 1979  
**RE:** Response to Municipal Water Department Chemical Usage Inquiry

This memo addresses the recent inquiry from the Woburn Water Department regarding chemical usage and disposal practices at our East Woburn facility. As discussed in yesterday's management meeting, we need to provide a coordinated response that addresses their concerns while protecting company interests.

The Water Department's letter dated June 8th requests detailed information about our historical use of trichloroethylene and other industrial solvents at the Cryovac facility on Washington Street. They specifically asked about disposal methods, storage locations, and any incidents involving chemical releases. This inquiry appears to be related to the recent closure of Wells G and H, though they have not explicitly stated this connection. Given the timing and nature of their questions, we should assume this is part of a broader investigation into potential groundwater contamination.

I recommend we provide a measured response that acknowledges our use of these chemicals for legitimate manufacturing purposes while emphasizing our commitment to proper handling procedures. We should note that trichloroethylene has been an industry-standard degreasing agent essential to our packaging machinery operations. Our response should reference our compliance with applicable regulations and our ongoing cooperation with regulatory authorities. However, we should avoid volunteering specific details about past disposal practices or quantities used without legal review.

Please coordinate with Legal Affairs before finalizing any written response. I suggest we request a meeting with the Water Department to discuss their concerns in person rather than providing extensive written documentation at this stage. This approach will allow us to better understand the scope of their investigation while maintaining appropriate discretion regarding operational details that could be taken out of context.

I will be available to discuss this matter further and can provide additional operational details as needed for our response strategy.
