## PERMIT AUTHORIZATION

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Division of Sanitary Engineering, hereby grants permission to the **City of Woburn** to construct and operate a municipal water supply well at the location described herein, subject to the terms, conditions, and specifications set forth in this permit.

## WELL LOCATION AND SPECIFICATIONS

**Site Location:** East Woburn, approximately 400 feet northeast of the intersection of Salem Street and the Aberjona River, within the boundaries of the East Woburn Industrial District.

**Coordinates:** Latitude 42°30'15"N, Longitude 71°08'42"W (approximate)

**Well Designation:** Well G (Municipal Water Supply System)

**Proposed Depth:** 88 feet below ground surface

**Casing Specifications:**
- 12-inch diameter steel casing to depth of 68 feet
- 8-inch diameter screen section from 68 feet to 88 feet
- Gravel pack installation around screen section
- Concrete surface seal extending 10 feet below ground surface

**Pumping Capacity:** Maximum sustained yield of 400 gallons per minute

**Service Area:** Eastern section of Woburn, primarily residential areas east of Main Street (Route 38), estimated to serve approximately 8,500 residents upon full operation.

## GEOLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT

Based upon the geological survey conducted by Whitman & Howard Engineers in February 1964, the proposed well site is located within a glacial outwash aquifer of suitable thickness and permeability for municipal water supply purposes. The aquifer consists primarily of sand and gravel deposits with intermittent clay lenses, typical of the Aberjona River valley geological formation.

**Aquifer Characteristics:**
- Static water level: Approximately 15 feet below ground surface
- Transmissivity: Estimated 15,000 gallons per day per foot
- Storage coefficient: 0.15
- Sustainable yield: 400-500 gallons per minute based on 72-hour pump test

The hydrogeological investigation indicates that the proposed well will draw primarily from the regional groundwater flow system moving generally northeastward toward the Aberjona River. No adverse impacts on existing wells or water supplies are anticipated based on the cone of influence calculations provided in the engineering report.

## WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

All water produced from this well shall meet or exceed the drinking water standards established by the U.S. Public Health Service Drinking Water Standards (1962) and Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations. Prior to placing the well into service, the following water quality testing shall be completed:

**Required Analysis:**
- Bacteriological examination (coliform count)
- Chemical analysis including pH, hardness, iron, manganese, chloride, sulfate, and nitrate
- Physical examination including color, odor, taste, and turbidity
- Microscopic examination for algae and other organisms

**Ongoing Monitoring:**
- Monthly bacteriological testing
- Annual comprehensive chemical analysis
- Quarterly physical and organoleptic examination

## CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS

Construction shall commence within six (6) months of permit issuance and be completed within twelve (12) months. The following construction standards shall be observed:

1. **Well Construction:** All work shall be performed by a licensed well driller registered with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Construction shall conform to Massachusetts Well Construction Standards (1963).

2. **Sanitary Protection:** A minimum 50-foot radius around the wellhead shall be maintained free of potential contamination sources. The wellhead shall be housed in a secure, weatherproof structure with proper ventilation.

3. **Disinfection:** The completed well shall be disinfected with chlorine solution and thoroughly flushed prior to sampling and testing.

4. **Testing:** A minimum 72-hour pumping test shall be conducted to verify sustained yield and drawdown characteristics.

## OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS

1. **Maximum Pumping Rate:** 400 gallons per minute sustained, 500 gallons per minute peak demand (not to exceed 4 hours daily)

2. **Water Level Monitoring:** Static and pumping water levels shall be measured and recorded monthly. Significant changes shall be reported to the Department.

3. **Cross-Connection Control:** Appropriate backflow prevention devices shall be installed to prevent contamination of the water supply system.

4. **Emergency Procedures:** The City shall maintain emergency shutdown capability and alternative water supply arrangements during well maintenance or contamination incidents.

## REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

The City of Woburn shall submit the following reports to the Department:

- **Construction Completion Report:** Within 30 days of well completion, including as-built drawings, pump test results, and initial water quality analysis
- **Annual Operating Report:** By January 31st of each year, including pumping records, water quality test results, and maintenance activities
- **Incident Reports:** Immediate notification of any water quality problems, equipment failures, or potential contamination events

## PERMIT CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS

This permit is issued subject to the following conditions:

1. This permit does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance with other applicable federal, state, or local laws and regulations.

2. The Department reserves the right to modify, suspend, or revoke this permit upon finding that the operation poses a threat to public health or violates permit conditions.

3. The permittee shall allow authorized Department representatives access to the well site and records for inspection and monitoring purposes.

4. Any significant changes to well construction, pumping capacity, or service area require prior written approval from the Department.

5. This permit is non-transferable without prior Department approval.

## VALIDITY PERIOD

This permit shall remain valid for the operational life of the well, subject to compliance with all terms and conditions. The permit shall be reviewed every five (5) years to ensure continued compliance with current standards and regulations.
