# CITY OF WOBURN
## WATER DEPARTMENT
### 424 Main Street, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801

**TO:** William T. Connolly, City Manager  
**FROM:** Robert F. Murphy, Water System Technician  
**DATE:** August 5, 1974  
**RE:** Weekly Water System Operations Report - Week of August 5, 1974

## System Overview

This report covers water system operations for the week ending August 5, 1974. Total system demand averaged 2.8 million gallons per day, consistent with summer usage patterns. All municipal wells remained operational throughout the reporting period, with Wells G and H continuing to provide approximately 40% of total system capacity.

## Well Performance and Production

**Wells G and H Operations:**
- Well G: Average daily production 680,000 gallons
- Well H: Average daily production 720,000 gallons
- Combined G&H production: 1.4 million gallons daily
- Pump efficiency within normal parameters
- No mechanical issues reported

Both wells maintained consistent flow rates despite increased summer demand. The East Woburn distribution network, primarily served by Wells G and H, experienced no pressure drops or service interruptions. Residents in the Montvale Road, Salem Street, and surrounding areas received uninterrupted service throughout the week.

**Legacy Wells (A through F):**
- Combined production: 1.4 million gallons daily
- Well C experienced minor pump maintenance on August 2
- All other legacy wells operating normally
- Distribution to central and western Woburn areas maintained standard pressure

## Water Quality Monitoring

Routine bacteriological testing was conducted on samples from all active wells and distribution points. All samples tested negative for coliform bacteria, meeting Massachusetts Department of Public Health requirements. Chlorination levels maintained between 0.2 and 0.8 ppm residual throughout the system.

Standard testing protocols were followed for pH, turbidity, and basic chemical parameters. Results remained within acceptable ranges as established by state guidelines. No customer complaints regarding taste, odor, or appearance were received during this reporting period.

## Distribution System Maintenance

Regular maintenance activities included:
- Hydrant flushing in the Industrial Avenue area on August 1
- Main valve inspection along New Boston Street
- Meter readings completed for residential accounts in East Woburn
- Minor leak repair at the intersection of Elm Street and Washington Avenue

The distribution network serving the East Woburn residential area, including Montvale Road, Salem Street, and adjacent neighborhoods, required no emergency repairs. System pressure remained stable at 65-70 psi throughout this service area.

## Customer Service Activities

The department responded to twelve service calls during the week, primarily related to meter readings and billing inquiries. Two requests for water service connections were processed for new construction projects. No complaints regarding water quality were logged, and routine customer interactions proceeded normally.

Residential customers in the East Woburn area, particularly those served directly by Wells G and H, reported satisfaction with service reliability and water pressure. The newer wells continue to provide excellent service capacity for the growing residential neighborhoods in this section of the city.

## Operational Concerns and Recommendations

While current operations proceed smoothly, I recommend continued monitoring of production capacity as summer demand peaks. The reliance on Wells G and H for East Woburn service requires maintaining these newer installations in optimal condition.

Equipment maintenance schedules should be strictly followed, particularly for the G and H well pumps given their critical role in serving the expanding residential areas. Any interruption to these wells would significantly impact service to approximately 800 households in the eastern section of the city.

I also suggest consideration of backup power capabilities for Wells G and H, as power outages would disproportionately affect East Woburn residents who depend almost exclusively on these water sources.

## System Planning Notes

The continued residential development in East Woburn will likely require increased production from Wells G and H. Current capacity appears adequate for existing demand, but future growth may necessitate additional infrastructure investments.

The geographic isolation of the East Woburn service area from the legacy well system means that Wells G and H function essentially as the sole water source for this growing residential community. This concentration of service dependency should be considered in all operational and maintenance planning.

## Conclusion

Water system operations for the week of August 5, 1974, proceeded without incident. All wells maintained production schedules, water quality met regulatory standards, and customer service remained uninterrupted. Wells G and H continued their reliable service to East Woburn residents, providing clean, safe drinking water to families throughout the Montvale Road area and surrounding neighborhoods.

The department will continue standard monitoring and maintenance protocols to ensure consistent service delivery to all areas of the city.
