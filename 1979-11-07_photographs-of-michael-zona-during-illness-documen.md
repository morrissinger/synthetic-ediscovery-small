# Letter to Massachusetts Department of Public Health

**November 7, 1979**

Massachusetts Department of Public Health  
150 Tremont Street  
Boston, Massachusetts 02111

Dear Dr. Cutler and Members of the Health Study Team,

I am writing to you as the mother of Michael Zona, who passed away on September 12, 1979, at the age of seven years old after a courageous battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia. I understand that your department is conducting an investigation into the health problems affecting children in our East Woburn neighborhood, particularly in relation to the contaminated water from Wells G and H that we have all been drinking for years.

As we discussed during your visit to our home last month, I have been carefully documenting Michael's illness through photographs, as advised by his pediatric oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Richardson suggested that visual documentation might be important for medical records and any future investigations. I am now prepared to share these photographs with your department, though I must tell you that reviewing them is extremely difficult for our family.

The enclosed envelope contains thirty-seven photographs taken between Michael's initial diagnosis in February 1978 and his final hospitalization in August 1979. These images show the progression of his illness and the physical toll that leukemia took on our beautiful boy. The early photographs from spring 1978 show Michael during his first rounds of chemotherapy - you can see how the treatments affected his appearance, causing him to lose his thick brown hair and become pale and thin. Despite this, his eyes still held their spark, and he continued to smile for the camera, always trying to be brave for his younger sister Marie.

The summer 1978 photographs document a period when we thought Michael was responding well to treatment. He had gained some weight back, and his energy seemed to return. We took him to Canobie Lake Park in July, and you can see in those pictures how he tried to enjoy the rides and games, though he tired easily. Looking back now, I realize how hard he was working just to appear normal, to give us hope that he was getting better. Even then, there were signs - the slight tremor in his hands that the doctors said was from the medications, the way he would suddenly need to sit down and rest.

The photographs from fall and winter 1978 show a different story. Michael's condition began to deteriorate more rapidly. The chemotherapy sessions became more frequent and more aggressive. In the pictures from his eighth birthday in November 1978, you can see how the treatments were affecting him more severely. His face became puffy from the steroids, and he developed sores in his mouth that made eating painful. But still, he insisted on blowing out his candles and opening his presents. He wanted so desperately to be a normal little boy.

The most difficult photographs to share are those from 1979, particularly the final months. These images document Michael's conscious suffering during his decline. The pain medications could only do so much, and there were many nights when he would cry from the bone pain that is characteristic of his type of leukemia. In the photographs from spring 1979, you can see the exhaustion in his face, the way his small body had become so frail. His arms and legs, once strong from playing baseball and riding his bicycle, became thin and weak.

The final series of photographs, taken during his last hospitalization at Mass General in August 1979, show a child who was fighting with every ounce of strength he had left. The medical equipment surrounding him - the IV lines, the monitors, the oxygen tubes - tell the story of how hard the medical team was working to save him. But you can also see in Michael's eyes that he knew what was happening. At seven years old, he understood that he was very sick, and he was scared.

I want you to understand that Michael was conscious and aware throughout most of his illness. He experienced pain, fear, and suffering that no child should ever have to endure. He asked me many times why this was happening to him, why he couldn't just get better and go back to school with his friends. He worried about his sister Marie, about whether she would get sick too. He worried about his father and me, and how sad we were all the time.

Dr. Richardson at Mass General told us that Michael's case was particularly aggressive, but that the type of leukemia he had - acute lymphocytic leukemia - was becoming more common in children. When your investigators came to our neighborhood and started asking about other sick children, we learned that Michael was not alone. The Kane family lost their son Kevin just months before we lost Michael. The Robbins family, the Gamaches, the Andersons - all of us in this same area of East Woburn, all drinking the same water from those wells.

I am sharing these photographs because I believe they provide important evidence of what this contaminated water has done to our children. Michael's suffering was real, it was prolonged, and it was documented. If these images can help prevent other families from going through what we have endured, then perhaps some meaning can come from our terrible loss.

Please handle these photographs with care. They represent the most precious and painful memories of our son's final months. I have made copies for your files, but the originals are irreplaceable to us. I trust that your department will use this documentation responsibly in your investigation and in any legal proceedings that may follow.

I also want to note that we have medical records from Massachusetts General Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, and Dr. Najarian's office here in Woburn that corroborate what these photographs show. Michael's medical team documented his conscious pain and suffering throughout his treatment, including detailed notes about his awareness of his condition and his emotional distress.

Our family is still grieving, and we may never fully recover from losing Michael. But we are committed to cooperating with your investigation and with any legal action that might hold the responsible parties accountable for what happened to our son and to the other children in our neighborhood. No other family should have to watch their child suffer the way Michael suffered.

Please contact me if you need any additional information or documentation. I can be reached at our home at 47 Maple Street or by telephone at 617-933-7284. I am usually home during the day while Marie is at school.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I pray that your investigation will bring answers and justice for all of our children.

Sincerely,

Joan Zona  
Mother of Michael Zona (1971-1979)
