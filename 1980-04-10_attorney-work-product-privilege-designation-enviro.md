## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Following the closure of municipal Wells G and H in East Woburn, Massachusetts in May 1979, and subsequent investigations revealing volatile organic compound contamination, this office has conducted a comprehensive legal risk assessment regarding W.R. Grace Company's potential exposure. This memorandum provides privileged analysis of our defensive posture and recommended litigation strategy in anticipation of potential civil actions and regulatory enforcement proceedings.

The contamination discovery presents significant legal exposure across multiple fronts: potential personal injury claims from affected residents, environmental remediation costs, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. Our preliminary investigation suggests that while our Cryovac facility at 369 Washington Street utilized trichloroethylene and other solvents in manufacturing operations, establishing direct causation between our operations and the well contamination will present substantial evidentiary challenges for potential plaintiffs.

## II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND LEGAL CONTEXT

### A. Facility Operations and Chemical Usage

Our Cryovac subsidiary has operated packaging machinery manufacturing at the East Woburn facility since the early 1960s. Industrial solvents, including trichloroethylene, have been utilized as degreasers and cleaning agents consistent with standard industry practices. Historical waste disposal practices followed accepted industrial standards of the time period, though documentation of specific disposal methods requires further internal investigation.

Wells G and H, operational from 1964 and 1966 respectively, drew water from the Aberjona River Valley aquifer system. Our facility's location northeast of these wells within the same geological formation creates potential hydraulic connectivity, though groundwater flow patterns and contamination migration pathways remain subjects requiring expert hydrogeological analysis.

### B. Regulatory Environment and Enforcement Trends

The regulatory landscape surrounding industrial waste disposal has evolved significantly during the operational period of Wells G and H. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 established federal oversight of public water systems, while Massachusetts environmental regulations have become increasingly stringent. The Environmental Protection Agency's involvement in the Woburn investigation suggests potential federal enforcement action beyond state-level regulatory response.

Recent case law developments, particularly *Borel v. Fibreboard Paper Products Corp.* (1973) and emerging toxic tort precedents, indicate courts' increasing willingness to impose liability for industrial contamination despite compliance with historical disposal practices. The trend toward strict liability theories in environmental cases presents strategic challenges for defending against contamination claims.

## III. LITIGATION RISK ASSESSMENT

### A. Potential Civil Claims

**Personal Injury/Wrongful Death Actions:** The most significant exposure involves potential claims from residents whose children developed leukemia or other health conditions allegedly linked to contaminated water consumption. Establishing causation between specific chemical exposures and individual health outcomes presents complex medical and scientific challenges that favor defendants in toxic tort litigation.

**Medical Monitoring Claims:** Even absent manifest injury, affected residents may seek compensation for ongoing medical surveillance costs. Massachusetts law regarding medical monitoring recovery remains unsettled, providing opportunities for favorable precedent development.

**Property Damage Claims:** Homeowners may assert diminished property values due to contamination disclosure. Such claims typically require demonstration of actual market impact and present manageable damages exposure compared to personal injury actions.

### B. Regulatory Enforcement Exposure

EPA's investigation authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act and emerging Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) provisions create potential federal enforcement exposure. State environmental authorities possess parallel jurisdiction under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E and related regulations.

Potential penalties include civil monetary sanctions, remediation orders, and prospective operational restrictions. The absence of specific regulatory violations during the historical operational period may limit penalty exposure, though retroactive liability theories continue evolving.

## IV. DEFENSIVE STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Causation Defense Development

Our primary defensive strategy should focus on challenging causation linkages between our operations and alleged contamination. Multiple potential sources exist within the Aberjona River Valley, including the Beatrice Foods tannery operation and other industrial facilities. Developing alternative source theories through comprehensive environmental investigation will be essential.

Hydrogeological studies should be commissioned immediately to evaluate groundwater flow patterns, contaminant migration pathways, and temporal relationships between disposal activities and well contamination. Expert witness development in environmental engineering, hydrogeology, and toxicology should commence promptly.

### B. Regulatory Compliance Defense

Documentation of historical compliance with applicable regulations during relevant time periods provides important defensive ammunition. While regulatory standards have evolved, demonstrating adherence to contemporaneous requirements supports good faith defense arguments and may limit punitive damages exposure.

### C. Shared Responsibility Arguments

The presence of multiple industrial operations within the affected area supports comparative fault or contribution theories. Beatrice Foods' tannery operations historically utilized various chemicals and disposal practices that may have contributed to groundwater contamination. Developing evidence of other parties' responsibility will be crucial for damages apportionment.

## V. IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### A. Document Preservation and Management

All documents relating to chemical usage, waste disposal practices, environmental testing, and facility operations at the Woburn location must be preserved pending anticipated litigation. A litigation hold notice should be issued immediately to all relevant personnel.

Historical disposal records, chemical purchase documentation, facility modification records, and any prior environmental testing results require immediate identification and secure storage under attorney supervision.

### B. Expert Witness Retention

Retain qualified experts in the following disciplines:
- Environmental engineering and hydrogeology
- Toxicology and epidemiology  
- Industrial chemistry and manufacturing processes
- Economic damages assessment

### C. Insurance Coverage Analysis

Comprehensive general liability policies may provide coverage for environmental claims depending on policy language and coverage periods. Immediate review of historical insurance coverage should be undertaken to identify potential indemnification sources.

## VI. CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVILEGE PROTECTION

This analysis and all related investigative materials must remain strictly confidential under attorney-client privilege and work product protection. Any communications with technical consultants or expert witnesses should be conducted through counsel to maintain privilege protection.

No admissions regarding facility operations, waste disposal practices, or potential environmental impacts should be made to regulatory authorities, potential plaintiffs, or media representatives without prior legal counsel approval.

## VII. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS

The Wells G and H contamination investigation presents serious but manageable legal exposure for W.R. Grace Company. Success will depend upon aggressive development of causation defenses, comprehensive expert witness preparation, and strategic coordination with other potentially responsible parties.

This office recommends immediate implementation of the defensive strategy outlined above, with particular emphasis on expert witness retention and comprehensive environmental investigation to support our causation challenges. Regular strategy sessions should be scheduled to monitor developments and adjust tactics as the investigation progresses.
