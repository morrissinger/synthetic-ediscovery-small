## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This quarterly inventory report documents chemical storage, usage patterns, and disposal activities for the Cryovac packaging film production operations during the period January 1, 1963 through March 31, 1963. The report identifies current chemical inventories, consumption rates, waste generation volumes, and disposal methodologies in accordance with company safety protocols established in 1959.

Current operations maintain approximately 47,000 gallons of various chemical compounds in active storage, with monthly consumption averaging 8,200 gallons across all production lines. Waste generation during this reporting period totaled 2,840 gallons, disposed of through established ground disposal procedures at the Woburn facility.

## USAGE PATTERNS AND CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS

### First Quarter 1963 Consumption Summary

Production activities during the first quarter demonstrated consistent demand for chlorinated solvents, reflecting steady output from our packaging film manufacturing lines. Trichloroethylene consumption increased 12% compared to fourth quarter 1962, primarily due to expanded metal substrate preparation operations supporting new customer contracts with food packaging companies.

Perchloroethylene usage remained stable at approximately 1,650 gallons monthly, consistent with established cleaning protocols for film production equipment. The reliability of PCE for vapor degreasing operations continues to justify its position as our primary cleaning solvent despite unit costs approximately 15% higher than TCE alternatives.

Carbon tetrachloride consumption decreased 8% from previous quarter levels, reflecting optimization of extraction processes and improved recovery efficiency in Building 2 operations. Laboratory staff report successful implementation of distillation recovery procedures, reducing fresh solvent requirements by approximately 95 gallons monthly.

### Production Efficiency Metrics

Chemical utilization efficiency measurements indicate optimal consumption ratios relative to production output. Current solvent-to-product ratios average 0.23 gallons of chlorinated solvents per 1,000 square feet of finished packaging film, representing a 6% improvement over 1962 annual averages.

Recovery operations salvaged approximately 380 gallons of reusable solvents during the reporting period through distillation and separation processes. Recovered materials meet quality specifications for non-critical cleaning applications, reducing overall chemical procurement costs by an estimated $1,240 quarterly.

## WASTE GENERATION AND DISPOSAL PROCEDURES

### Waste Stream Classification

**Spent Solvents**
- Volume Generated: 1,850 gallons (Q1 1963)
- Composition: Mixed chlorinated hydrocarbons with metal particulates
- Disposal Method: Ground disposal at Woburn facility lagoons
- Frequency: Weekly transport via company truck

**Contaminated Water**
- Volume Generated: 720 gallons (Q1 1963)
- Source: Equipment washing, floor cleaning operations
- Composition: Water with trace solvent contamination (<2% by volume)
- Disposal Method: Discharge to Woburn facility drainage system

**Laboratory Waste**
- Volume Generated: 270 gallons (Q1 1963)
- Composition: Mixed analytical reagents, test samples
- Disposal Method: Combined with spent solvents for ground disposal

### Disposal Site Operations

The Woburn facility maintains three disposal lagoons constructed in 1959 for containment of liquid chemical wastes. Lagoon capacity totals approximately 50,000 gallons, with current utilization at 68% of design capacity. Monthly monitoring indicates stable containment with no evidence of overflow or structural compromise.

Ground disposal procedures follow company protocols established by the Engineering Department in consultation with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines. Waste materials undergo basic segregation to separate incompatible chemicals before transport to disposal lagoons. pH neutralization procedures apply to acidic waste streams prior to disposal.

## SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE OBSERVATIONS

### Personnel Exposure Monitoring

Quarterly air sampling in production areas indicates solvent vapor concentrations within acceptable industrial hygiene standards established by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. TCE concentrations average 85 parts per million in Building 3, well below the 100 ppm threshold limit value. PCE measurements consistently register below 75 ppm, compared to the 100 ppm standard.

Personal protective equipment usage remains consistent with company safety protocols. All personnel handling chlorinated solvents utilize approved respirators, protective gloves, and safety eyewear. Monthly safety training sessions continue to emphasize proper handling procedures and emergency response protocols.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

Current chemical storage and handling procedures align with Massachusetts industrial safety regulations and local fire department requirements. Storage tank inspections completed in March 1963 identified no structural deficiencies or safety concerns. All tanks maintain proper labeling, secondary containment, and fire suppression systems.

Waste disposal operations continue under existing permits issued by local authorities. No regulatory violations or compliance issues identified during the reporting period. Communication with Woburn city officials remains positive regarding our waste management procedures.

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

### Inventory Management Optimization

Consider reducing TCE inventory levels by approximately 15% to optimize storage costs while maintaining adequate supply for production requirements. Current three-month supply exceeds operational needs and ties up working capital unnecessarily.

Evaluate alternative suppliers for methylene chloride to reduce unit costs. Current pricing from Diamond Alkali represents a 12% premium compared to competitive quotations from other suppliers offering equivalent quality specifications.

### Process Improvement Opportunities

Expand solvent recovery operations to include methylene chloride distillation, potentially reducing fresh chemical purchases by an additional 200 gallons annually. Initial engineering assessment suggests favorable economics with payback
