# CRYOVAC INC.
## MONTHLY FACILITIES OPERATIONS REPORT
### SOLVENT USAGE ANALYSIS

**TO:** Thomas A. Sullivan, Operations Director  
**FROM:** Robert M. Hendricks, Facilities Manager  
**DATE:** August 3, 1970  
**RE:** July 1970 Facilities Operations - Solvent Usage and Disposal Summary

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of solvent usage and disposal operations at our Woburn facility for the month of July 1970. Total solvent consumption increased 12% over June figures, primarily due to expanded production of shrink film packaging materials. Current disposal methods continue to meet operational requirements while maintaining cost efficiency.

## SOLVENT USAGE STATISTICS

### Primary Solvents - July 1970

**Trichloroethylene (TCE)**
- Beginning inventory: 2,847 gallons
- Received: 4,200 gallons
- Consumed: 3,926 gallons
- Ending inventory: 3,121 gallons
- Primary use: Metal degreasing operations, equipment cleaning

**Perchloroethylene (PCE)**
- Beginning inventory: 1,634 gallons
- Received: 2,800 gallons
- Consumed: 2,445 gallons
- Ending inventory: 1,989 gallons
- Primary use: Film processing, precision cleaning

**Methylene Chloride**
- Beginning inventory: 892 gallons
- Received: 1,500 gallons
- Consumed: 1,378 gallons
- Ending inventory: 1,014 gallons
- Primary use: Adhesive removal, surface preparation

**1,1,1-Trichloroethane**
- Beginning inventory: 567 gallons
- Received: 900 gallons
- Consumed: 823 gallons
- Ending inventory: 644 gallons
- Primary use: Vapor degreasing, parts washing

## DISPOSAL OPERATIONS

### Current Disposal Methods

Our facility continues to utilize the most cost-effective disposal methods available for spent solvents and contaminated materials. The rear property disposal area has proven adequate for our operational needs, with waste materials being deposited in designated areas behind the main production building.

**Liquid Waste Disposal**
- Spent solvents: 1,247 gallons disposed via rear property drainage system
- Contaminated wash water: 892 gallons directed to rear property infiltration area
- Sludge materials: 340 cubic feet deposited in rear property disposal zone

**Solid Waste Disposal**
- Contaminated rags and filters: 127 cubic feet buried in rear property area
- Used containers and drums: 23 units disposed in rear property section
- General production waste: Regular pickup by municipal services

### Disposal Area Maintenance

The rear property disposal area continues to function effectively. Ground conditions remain stable, and natural drainage appears to be handling liquid waste volumes adequately. No surface ponding has been observed during July operations.

## OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

### Production Integration

Solvent usage efficiency has improved 3% over the previous month through implementation of revised cleaning protocols. The degreasing operations are now synchronized more effectively with production schedules, reducing idle time and minimizing solvent waste.

**Key Improvements:**
- Reduced TCE consumption per unit by 0.8%
- Extended PCE bath life by average of 2.3 days
- Decreased overall contaminated waste volume by 6%

### Cost Analysis

Total solvent costs for July: $18,247
- TCE: $7,834 (43% of total)
- PCE: $6,923 (38% of total)
- Methylene Chloride: $2,156 (12% of total)
- 1,1,1-Trichloroethane: $1,334 (7% of total)

Disposal costs remain minimal under current methods, representing less than 2% of total solvent-related expenses.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

### Current Standards

Our operations continue to meet all applicable federal and state regulations for industrial solvent usage. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering has not issued any new requirements affecting our operations during the reporting period.

### Documentation

All required usage logs and inventory records are maintained in accordance with standard practices. Monthly consumption reports are filed with the appropriate regulatory agencies as required.

## SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Worker Safety

No incidents involving solvent exposure were reported during July. All personnel continue to utilize appropriate personal protective equipment during solvent handling operations. Ventilation systems are functioning within normal parameters.

### Environmental Management

Our current disposal practices represent industry-standard methods for facilities of our size and production volume. The rear property disposal area provides adequate capacity for anticipated waste volumes through the remainder of 1970.

Ground conditions in the disposal area remain stable, with no evidence of surface contamination or off-site migration of materials. Natural soil conditions appear to be providing effective containment of disposed materials.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Short-term Actions

1. **Inventory Management**: Continue current procurement schedules to maintain optimal inventory levels while avoiding excess storage costs.

2. **Process Optimization**: Implement additional efficiency measures in PCE operations to further extend bath life and reduce consumption.

3. **Disposal Area**: Continue monitoring of rear property disposal area conditions to ensure adequate capacity for projected waste volumes.

### Long-term Considerations

1. **Capacity Planning**: Current disposal methods should remain adequate through 1972 based on projected production increases.

2. **Cost Management**: Investigate potential volume discounts for TCE and PCE procurement given consistent high usage levels.

3. **Process Improvements**: Evaluate new degreasing equipment that may offer improved solvent recovery capabilities.

## CONCLUSION

July 1970 operations demonstrate continued efficiency in solvent utilization while maintaining cost-effective disposal practices. Current methods are meeting all operational requirements and regulatory standards. The facility is well-positioned to support projected production increases through the remainder of 1970 and into 1971.

The rear property disposal system continues to provide reliable and economical waste management capabilities. No modifications to current practices are recommended at this time.
