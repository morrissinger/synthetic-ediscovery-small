# QUARTERLY ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE REPORT
## CRYOVAC DIVISION - Q2 1972

**TO:** W.R. Grace Company Environmental Coordinator  
**FROM:** Cryovac Inc. Environmental Affairs Department  
**DATE:** June 26, 1972  
**SUBJECT:** Second Quarter 1972 Environmental Compliance Summary

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report summarizes environmental compliance activities and waste management operations at the Cryovac Division facility located at 15 Olympia Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts for the period April 1 through June 30, 1972. The facility continues to operate within established parameters for production of plastic packaging materials and maintains waste disposal practices consistent with current industry standards and applicable regulations.

## FACILITY OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

During Q2 1972, the Woburn facility maintained full production capacity across three manufacturing lines producing polyethylene and polyvinylidene chloride films for food packaging applications. Total production volume for the quarter was 2,847 tons, representing a 12% increase over Q1 1972 figures. Manufacturing operations utilized standard industrial solvents including trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and 1,1,1-trichloroethane for cleaning and degreasing applications.

The facility employed 247 full-time workers during the reporting period, with an additional 31 temporary workers hired to meet increased production demands. Safety training programs were conducted monthly, and no reportable workplace injuries occurred during Q2 operations.

## WASTE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

### Liquid Waste Disposal

Liquid waste generated during the quarter totaled approximately 15,200 gallons, consisting primarily of spent cleaning solvents, process rinse water, and equipment wash solutions. Disposal methods employed during the reporting period included:

- **On-site evaporation lagoons:** 8,400 gallons of dilute solvent solutions were directed to two concrete-lined evaporation basins located on the southeastern portion of the facility property. These basins allow for natural evaporation of water content while concentrating recoverable solvents.

- **Direct discharge to drainage system:** 4,100 gallons of process water meeting established discharge criteria were released to the facility's storm drain system, which connects to the municipal drainage network serving the Olympia Avenue industrial corridor.

- **Contracted disposal services:** 2,700 gallons of concentrated waste solvents were collected by Deerfield Industrial Services for off-site treatment and disposal at their licensed facility in Springfield, Massachusetts.

### Solid Waste Management

Solid waste generation for Q2 totaled 89 tons, including production scraps, packaging materials, and general facility refuse. All solid waste was collected by Municipal Waste Services of Woburn under contract for disposal at the city's authorized landfill facility.

### Air Emissions

Routine air emissions from manufacturing operations include vapors from solvent cleaning operations and plastic film production processes. The facility operates within established ventilation parameters, with exhaust systems directing emissions through stack releases at heights of 35 and 42 feet above ground level. No citizen complaints regarding air quality were received during the reporting period.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STATUS

The facility maintains compliance with all applicable federal and state environmental regulations. During Q2 1972, the following regulatory interactions occurred:

- **May 15, 1972:** Routine inspection by Massachusetts Department of Public Health representatives. No violations were cited, and inspectors noted satisfactory maintenance of waste storage areas and disposal records.

- **June 8, 1972:** Self-reported minor spill incident involving approximately 45 gallons of TCE cleaning solution. Spill was contained within facility boundaries and remediated according to established procedures. No off-site environmental impact was observed.

## GROUNDWATER MONITORING

Monthly groundwater monitoring was conducted at three on-site monitoring wells installed in 1971. Water samples were collected and analyzed by Northeast Environmental Laboratories of Boston. Results for Q2 2022 showed:

- **Well MW-1 (upgradient):** All parameters within normal ranges
- **Well MW-2 (downgradient east):** Trace levels of chlorinated compounds detected in May sample (0.02 ppm TCE, 0.01 ppm PCE), below established action thresholds
- **Well MW-3 (downgradient south):** All parameters within normal ranges

Monitoring results indicate no significant impact to groundwater quality from facility operations. Trace detections in MW-2 are consistent with historical background levels observed in the industrial area and remain well below any applicable standards.

## COMMUNITY RELATIONS

The facility maintains positive relationships with the local community through regular communication with city officials and participation in the Woburn Chamber of Commerce. No environmental complaints were received from neighboring residents during Q2 1972.

Company representatives attended the June 20, 1972 Woburn City Council meeting to provide updates on facility operations and answer questions from council members regarding waste management practices.

## PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS

Several facility improvements are planned for implementation during Q3 1972:

1. **Enhanced containment:** Installation of additional secondary containment around solvent storage tanks, scheduled for completion by August 15, 1972.

2. **Waste minimization:** Implementation of solvent recovery system to reduce liquid waste generation by an estimated 25%, with installation beginning July 30, 1972.

3. **Monitoring expansion:** Addition of two new groundwater monitoring wells to provide enhanced coverage of downgradient areas, planned for September 1972.

## FINANCIAL SUMMARY

Environmental compliance expenditures for Q2 1972 totaled $23,400, including:

- Waste disposal services: $8,200
- Laboratory analysis: $3,100
- Equipment maintenance: $4,700
- Regulatory compliance: $2,800
- Monitoring and reporting: $4,600

These expenditures represent 0.8% of quarterly revenue and are consistent with budgeted amounts for environmental management activities.

## CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Cryovac Division facility continues to operate in compliance with applicable environmental regulations while maintaining efficient production operations. Current waste management practices are effective in minimizing environmental impact while supporting business objectives.

Ongoing monitoring programs provide adequate oversight of potential environmental effects, and planned facility improvements will further enhance our environmental performance. The facility's environmental management program serves as a model for responsible industrial operations in the greater Boston metropolitan area.

We recommend continued implementation of planned improvements and maintenance of current monitoring protocols to ensure ongoing compliance and environmental protection.
