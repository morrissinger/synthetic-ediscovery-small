# SITE INSPECTION LOG
## Chemical Dump Area - Beatrice Property

**Inspector:** Thomas Martinez, Environmental Technician  
**Company:** John J. Riley Company  
**Date:** September 14, 1976  
**Time:** 10:30 AM  
**Weather:** Partly cloudy, 68°F, light wind from SW  

### SITE IDENTIFICATION

**Property:** Beatrice Foods Industrial Facility  
**Location:** East Woburn, Massachusetts  
**Coordinates:** Approximately 1,200 feet northeast of Wells G and H  
**Access:** Via service road from New Boston Street  
**Purpose:** Routine inspection of chemical disposal area per company protocol  

### SITE DESCRIPTION

The inspection area encompasses approximately 2.5 acres of the northeastern section of the Beatrice property, designated for industrial waste disposal activities. The terrain slopes gently toward the southeast, with natural drainage patterns directing surface water flow in the direction of the Aberjona River watershed. Soil composition appears to be typical glacial till with sandy loam characteristics common to the region.

### OBSERVATIONS

#### Visual Assessment

**Surface Conditions:**
- Multiple areas of discolored soil observed, ranging from dark brown to reddish-black staining
- Approximately 12-15 distinct dumping locations identified across the site
- Evidence of recent vehicular activity with tire tracks visible in softer ground
- Several metal drums (55-gallon capacity) scattered throughout area, some showing signs of corrosion and leakage
- Vegetation stress evident in areas of heaviest chemical deposition, with yellowing and dying grass in roughly circular patterns

**Drum Inventory:**
- 23 metal drums counted during inspection
- 8 drums showing visible rust and deterioration
- 4 drums with apparent punctures or splits in sidewalls
- 2 drums completely overturned with contents spilled
- Several drums lacking proper labeling or identification markings

**Liquid Observations:**
- Dark, oily substance pooled in low-lying areas
- Rainbow sheen visible on standing water in three locations
- Strong chemical odor present throughout inspection area
- Liquid appears to have penetrated soil surface in multiple locations

#### Chemical Indicators

**Odor Assessment:**
- Predominant smell of organic solvents throughout site
- Particularly strong concentrations near drum storage areas
- Slight metallic taste noted in air during inspection
- Odor intensity varies with wind direction and proximity to disposal points

**Physical Evidence:**
- Crystalline residue observed on soil surface in two locations
- White powdery substance coating visible on several drum exteriors
- Evidence of chemical reaction between spilled materials and metal containers
- Soil consistency altered in areas of heaviest contamination, appearing more compact and less permeable

### DRAINAGE AND HYDROLOGY

**Surface Water Flow:**
- Natural drainage patterns direct runoff toward southeast
- Seasonal water table fluctuations likely affect contaminant mobility
- Distance to nearest residential wells estimated at 1,200-1,500 feet
- Groundwater flow direction consistent with regional patterns toward municipal well field

**Infiltration Concerns:**
- Sandy soil composition allows rapid percolation of liquid materials
- No evidence of containment measures or liner systems
- Surface runoff during precipitation events likely carries contaminants beyond immediate disposal area
- Seasonal freeze-thaw cycles may accelerate contaminant migration through soil matrix

### ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Immediate Area:**
- Vegetation kill zone extends approximately 50 feet from primary disposal points
- Soil discoloration suggests chemical penetration to depth of at least 2-3 feet
- Wildlife activity notably absent in areas of heaviest contamination
- Insect populations appear reduced compared to surrounding undisturbed areas

**Potential Migration:**
- Groundwater contamination likely given soil permeability and disposal practices
- Surface water impact possible during storm events
- Contaminant plume migration toward municipal wells represents potential concern
- Seasonal variations in water table may affect contaminant distribution patterns

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Secure or remove deteriorating drums to prevent further spillage
   - Install temporary containment measures around active leak sources
   - Restrict vehicular access to minimize soil disturbance and tracking of contaminated materials

2. **Medium-Term Measures:**
   - Conduct soil sampling program to determine extent and concentration of contamination
   - Install monitoring wells to assess groundwater impact
   - Develop containment strategy for existing contaminated soil areas

3. **Long-Term Considerations:**
   - Evaluate feasibility of soil remediation or removal
   - Assess need for groundwater treatment systems
   - Consider alternative disposal methods for future waste streams

### REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

Current disposal practices appear inconsistent with emerging environmental protection standards. While specific regulations remain limited, prudent management would suggest modification of current disposal methods to minimize environmental impact and potential future liability.

### DOCUMENTATION

**Photographs:** 
- 12 photographs taken documenting site conditions
- Film roll #76-0914-A stored in company files
- Key locations marked on site map for reference

**Samples:**
- No samples collected during this inspection
- Future sampling program recommended for comprehensive assessment

**Chain of Custody:**
- N/A for this observational inspection

### INSPECTOR CERTIFICATION

I certify that the observations recorded in this log represent accurate documentation of site conditions as observed during the September 14, 1976 inspection. Weather conditions were favorable for inspection activities, and access to all designated areas was achieved without restriction.
