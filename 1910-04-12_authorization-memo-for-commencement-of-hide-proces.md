# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** William Patterson, Operations Foreman  
**FROM:** John J. Riley, Owner and General Manager  
**DATE:** April 12, 1910  
**RE:** Authorization for Commencement of Hide Processing Operations

Mr. Patterson,

Following our discussions regarding the readiness of our tannery facilities at 228 Salem Street, I hereby authorize the commencement of full-scale hide processing operations effective Monday, April 18, 1910. Our preparation phase has proceeded satisfactorily, and I am confident that we have established the necessary infrastructure to support a profitable leather manufacturing enterprise.

The chemical storage areas have been completed according to specifications, with adequate space allocated for the chromium sulfate, sodium sulfide, and lime solutions essential to our tanning processes. I have arranged for regular deliveries of these materials through our supplier agreements with Boston Chemical Works, and the first shipments are scheduled to arrive Thursday morning. Please ensure that all handling procedures follow the methods we discussed, particularly regarding the mixing of solutions and the disposal of spent chemicals. The drainage system connecting to the rear of the property should accommodate our processing waste efficiently, directing effluent toward the natural drainage patterns that lead to the Aberjona River.

Our initial production capacity will focus on cowhides and smaller leather goods, with plans to expand into specialty tanning as demand warrants. The workforce of twelve men you have assembled appears well-suited to our immediate needs, and I trust your supervision will maintain both productivity and safety standards. The proximity of our facility to the railroad tracks provides excellent access for both incoming raw materials and outgoing finished products, positioning us advantageously within the regional leather trade.

I expect regular reports on production volumes, material usage, and any operational concerns that may arise. Our success depends upon establishing efficient processes while maintaining the quality standards that will distinguish John J. Riley Company leather in the Massachusetts market. The industrial development occurring throughout East Woburn presents significant opportunities for expansion, and I intend for our operation to serve as the foundation for long-term growth in this sector.

Proceed with operations as planned, and report any significant developments immediately.
