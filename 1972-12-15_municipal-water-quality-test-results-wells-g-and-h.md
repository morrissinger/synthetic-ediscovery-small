**FROM:** Robert J. McNamara, Water Superintendent  
**DATE:** December 15, 1972  
**RE:** Quarterly Water Quality Analysis - Wells G and H

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of routine water quality testing conducted on Wells G and H during the fourth quarter of 1972. Samples were collected on November 28, 1972, and analyzed at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Laboratory in Boston according to standard protocols established under the Safe Drinking Water Act guidelines.

Both wells continue to meet federal and state standards for municipal water supply, though certain parameters warrant continued monitoring as outlined in the recommendations section of this report.

## WELL IDENTIFICATION AND SPECIFICATIONS

**Well G**
- Location: Industrial Avenue, adjacent to Aberjona River
- Depth: 88 feet
- Installation Date: March 1964
- Pump Capacity: 400 gallons per minute
- Service Area: East Woburn residential districts

**Well H**
- Location: Salem Street, 200 yards southeast of Well G
- Depth: 90 feet
- Installation Date: August 1966
- Pump Capacity: 450 gallons per minute
- Service Area: East Woburn residential districts

## SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected following Massachusetts Department of Public Health Protocol 7-A for municipal well testing. Samples were drawn directly from well heads after a minimum 10-minute flush period to ensure representative aquifer water. All samples were collected in sterile glass containers provided by the state laboratory and transported under refrigeration within 24 hours of collection.

Testing was conducted for the following parameters:
- Bacteriological contamination (coliform count)
- Physical characteristics (color, odor, turbidity)
- Chemical composition (pH, hardness, chloride, iron, manganese)
- Heavy metals (lead, copper, zinc)
- General mineral content

## ANALYTICAL RESULTS

- Odor: Threshold 2 (Standard: <3 threshold)
- Turbidity: 0.8 NTU (Standard: <1.0 NTU)

**Chemical Analysis:**
- pH: 6.8 (Standard: 6.5-8.5)
- Total Hardness: 180 mg/L as CaCO3 (Standard: <500 mg/L)
- Chloride: 45 mg/L (Standard: <250 mg/L)
- Iron: 0.15 mg/L (Standard: <0.3 mg/L)
- Manganese: 0.08 mg/L (Standard: <0.05 mg/L) **[Slightly Elevated]**

**Heavy Metals:**

### Well H - Sample Collection Date: November 28, 1972, 10:30 AM

**Bacteriological Analysis:**
- Total Coliform Count: 0 per 100ml (Standard: <1 per 100ml)
- Fecal Coliform Count: 0 per 100ml (Standard: 0 per 100ml)

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Color: 8 units (Standard: <15 units)
- Odor: Threshold 2 (Standard: <3 threshold)
- Turbidity: 1.2 NTU (Standard: <1.0 NTU) **[Slightly Elevated]**

**Chemical Analysis:**
- pH: 6.9 (Standard: 6.5-8.5)
- Total Hardness: 195 mg/L as CaCO3 (Standard: <500 mg/L)
- Chloride: 52 mg/L (Standard: <250 mg/L)
- Iron: 0.22 mg/L (Standard: <0.3 mg/L)
- Manganese: 0.12 mg/L (Standard: <0.05 mg/L) **[Elevated]**

**Heavy Metals:**
- Lead: <0.01 mg/L (Standard: <0.05 mg/L)
- Copper: 0.03 mg/L (Standard: <1.0 mg/L)
- Zinc: 0.24 mg/L (Standard: <5.0 mg/L)

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

Comparison with previous quarterly reports shows consistent water quality parameters for both wells, with the following notable trends:

1. **Manganese Levels**: Both wells show manganese concentrations above the recommended standard of 0.05 mg/L, with Well H showing higher levels than Well G. This represents a gradual increase from levels recorded in 1971.

2. **Turbidity**: Well H exhibits slightly elevated turbidity, which may be related to the increased manganese content.

3. **Chloride Content**: Both wells show stable chloride levels within acceptable ranges, though slightly higher than readings from wells serving other areas of Woburn.

## OPERATIONAL STATUS

Both Wells G and H remain in active service, operating on an as-needed basis to supplement the primary water supply from Wells A, B, C, D, E, and F. During the reporting period, Wells G and H provided approximately 35% of the total municipal water supply, serving primarily the residential areas east of Main Street (Route 38).

The wells have been operating reliably with minimal maintenance requirements. Pump efficiency remains within acceptable parameters, and well casings show no signs of deterioration.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Continued Monitoring**: Given the elevated manganese levels in both wells, monthly rather than quarterly testing is recommended for the next six months to establish trend patterns.

2. **Source Investigation**: The Water Department should investigate potential sources of manganese contamination in the aquifer, including review of industrial activities in the watershed area.

3. **Treatment Consideration**: If manganese levels continue to increase, installation of manganese removal equipment should be evaluated for economic feasibility.

4. **Customer Notification**: While current levels do not require public notification under state regulations, residents served by Wells G and H should be advised that water may occasionally have a slight metallic taste due to natural mineral content.

5. **Expanded Testing**: Consider inclusion of additional parameters in future testing protocols, particularly organic compounds, given the industrial nature of the surrounding area.

## CERTIFICATION

This report has been prepared in accordance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health regulations and federal Safe Drinking Water Act requirements. All analytical work was performed by certified laboratory technicians using approved methodologies.

The water from Wells G and H meets all current federal and state standards for public water supply and is safe for human consumption.
