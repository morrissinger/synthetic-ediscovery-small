# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Operations Manager  
**FROM:** John J. Riley, Owner  
**DATE:** April 14, 1951  
**RE:** Quarterly Inspection of Tannery Grounds and Chemical Storage Areas

Following my routine quarterly inspection of our Salem Street facility conducted this morning, I am documenting the current status of our operations and noting several areas requiring immediate attention to maintain proper standards of our leather processing business.

**Inspection Findings - Chemical Storage and Waste Management:**

The inspection revealed that our chemical storage areas remain in satisfactory condition for continued operations. The concrete holding areas for spent tanning solutions continue to serve their intended purpose, though I observed some minor surface cracking in the southeastern section near the railroad tracks. Our standard practice of allowing treated wastewater to percolate into the ground through these holding areas appears to be functioning as designed, with no visible pooling or overflow conditions present during today's inspection.

The drum storage area containing our industrial solvents—including the trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene used for degreasing operations—shows appropriate organization and accessibility for operational needs. I noted that seventeen drums are currently stored in this area, with adequate spacing maintained between containers. The ground surface beneath the storage area shows some minor staining, which is consistent with normal handling procedures and does not indicate any operational deficiencies requiring modification of our established practices.

**Operational Efficiency and Maintenance Requirements:**

Our leather processing operations continue to meet production targets established for this quarter. The chemical treatment processes are functioning within normal parameters, and the quality of finished leather goods remains consistent with our established standards. However, I am directing that maintenance attention be given to the concrete surfaces showing minor deterioration, as proper facility maintenance reflects our commitment to professional operations.

The proximity of our operations to the Aberjona River continues to provide convenient access to water resources necessary for our processing activities, while the railroad access maintains our ability to receive raw materials and ship finished products efficiently. I am satisfied that our current operational procedures adequately address the requirements of leather manufacturing while maintaining appropriate standards for a family-operated business serving the Massachusetts leather industry.

**Action Items:**

Effective immediately, I am directing that concrete repairs be scheduled for completion before our next quarterly inspection. Additionally, I want to ensure that our chemical handling procedures continue to reflect industry standards appropriate for a facility of our size and operational scope. These measures will ensure that the Riley Company maintains its reputation for reliable leather processing operations while meeting our responsibilities as an established business in the East Woburn industrial community.

I will conduct the next quarterly inspection in July 1951 and expect that the minor maintenance items identified today will be addressed by that time.
