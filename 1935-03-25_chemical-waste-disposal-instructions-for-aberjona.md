## DISPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHEMICAL WASTE MATERIALS

### IMMEDIATE DISPOSAL REQUIREMENTS

Effective immediately, all disposal crew workers are directed to proceed with the following waste disposal operations for the week ending March 30, 1935. These instructions supersede previous informal arrangements and establish standard procedures for handling tannery chemical waste.

**Chromium Solution Waste:**
- Collect all spent chromium tanning solutions from Vats 3, 7, and 12
- Transport waste in steel drums marked "CR-WASTE" 
- Dispose of contents in designated area along Aberjona River embankment, approximately 200 yards southeast of main tannery building
- Empty drums thoroughly and rinse with river water before returning to storage

**Acid Bath Residue:**
- Drain all sulfuric acid baths from leather processing stations
- Neutralize with lime if available, though not required for disposal
- Direct discharge into drainage ditches leading to Aberjona River
- Ensure complete drainage to prevent accumulation in work areas

**Solvent and Degreasing Chemicals:**
- Collect all used benzene, toluene, and degreasing solvents from cleaning operations
- Consolidate materials in available containers
- Dispose of liquid waste in low-lying areas west of railroad tracks
- Bury any solid chemical residue in designated pit areas behind main building

### OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

**Safety Considerations:**
Workers should exercise reasonable caution when handling chemical materials. Avoid direct skin contact with concentrated acids and wear available protective clothing when practical. Ensure adequate ventilation in enclosed disposal areas.

**Timing and Scheduling:**
Complete all disposal operations during regular working hours when possible. Night disposal operations are acceptable for urgent waste removal requirements. Coordinate with railroad schedule to avoid interference with freight operations along western property boundary.

**Documentation:**
Maintain informal records of disposal quantities and locations for internal reference. No external reporting of disposal activities is required under current regulations.

### SPECIFIC DISPOSAL LOCATIONS

**Primary Disposal Area A:** Aberjona River embankment area, accessible via existing cart path from main tannery building. Suitable for liquid chemical waste and spent processing solutions.

**Secondary Disposal Area B:** Low-lying ground west of railroad tracks, appropriate for solvent waste and mixed chemical materials. Natural drainage patterns will carry materials away from immediate work areas.

**Tertiary Disposal Area C:** Excavated pits behind main building, designated for solid chemical residue and contaminated materials requiring burial disposal.

### ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS

The disposal crew should prioritize efficient removal of waste materials to maintain production schedules. The tannery operates on full capacity during spring months, and waste accumulation cannot be permitted to interfere with leather processing operations.

Workers are reminded that disposal of tannery waste represents standard industry practice throughout Massachusetts leather manufacturing operations. The Aberjona River and surrounding land areas provide adequate capacity for chemical waste disposal without adverse impact on tannery operations.

Any questions regarding these disposal procedures should be directed to the undersigned during regular business hours. Workers encountering unusual chemical reactions or disposal difficulties should exercise judgment in adapting these instructions to specific circumstances.

**Weather Considerations:**
Recent March weather has created favorable conditions for waste disposal operations. Ground conditions remain suitable for cart transport to disposal areas. River water levels are adequate for dilution of liquid waste materials.

**Equipment Requirements:**
- Steel drums and containers (available from storage area)
- Hand carts for transport of heavy materials
- Shovels and basic excavation tools
- Protective clothing as available

These disposal instructions remain in effect until further notice. The disposal crew should proceed with routine waste removal operations according to production schedules and waste accumulation patterns.
