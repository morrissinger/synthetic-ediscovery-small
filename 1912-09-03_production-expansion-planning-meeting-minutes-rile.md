## AGENDA ITEM 1: PRODUCTION CAPACITY REVIEW

Mr. Riley opened the meeting by reviewing current production figures for the third quarter of 1912. The tannery has processed 2,847 hides during July and August, representing a 23% increase over the same period in 1911. Mr. Riley expressed satisfaction with these numbers but emphasized the need for further expansion to meet growing demand from Boston-area shoe manufacturers and leather goods companies.

**Discussion Points:**
- Current daily processing capacity stands at 45-50 hides per day
- Backlog of orders extends through November 1912
- Three new contracts secured with Brockton shoe manufacturers
- Railroad freight rates have remained stable, supporting profitable operations

**Decision:** Proceed with plans to expand daily processing capacity to 75 hides per day by spring 1913.

## AGENDA ITEM 2: CHEMICAL SUPPLY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT

Mr. O'Brien provided a comprehensive report on chemical inventory and usage patterns. The tannery currently maintains adequate supplies of chromium salts, sulfuric acid, and lime for the chrome tanning process. Monthly consumption has increased proportionally with production volume.

**Current Chemical Inventory:**
- Chromium sulfate: 2,400 pounds in storage
- Sulfuric acid: 850 gallons in storage tanks
- Lime: 1,200 pounds
- Various oils and finishing compounds: adequate supplies

Mr. O'Brien raised concerns about waste disposal practices, noting that the current system of directing spent liquors and washwater to the drainage ditches leading toward the Aberjona River may require attention as production increases. He recommended consideration of expanded settling ponds to allow for better separation of solids before discharge.

Mr. Riley acknowledged these concerns but noted that current practices are consistent with industry standards throughout Massachusetts. He stated that the company's primary obligation is to maintain profitable operations while meeting basic sanitary requirements. The proximity to the Aberjona River provides convenient disposal for liquid wastes, and no complaints have been received from downstream properties.

**Decision:** Continue current waste disposal practices while monitoring for any obvious problems. Consider settling pond expansion only if absolutely necessary for operational efficiency.

## AGENDA ITEM 3: FACILITY EXPANSION PLANNING

Mr. Hartwell presented preliminary plans for expanding the main processing building to accommodate increased production capacity. The proposed expansion would add 1,200 square feet to the eastern section of the facility, closer to the Aberjona River.

**Expansion Specifications:**
- Additional vat space for 12 chrome tanning drums
- Expanded drying area with improved ventilation
- Additional chemical storage capacity
- Enhanced railroad siding access

Mr. Donovan noted that the eastern expansion would require some grading and fill work near the river bank. He recommended using available industrial fill material to level the site, including ash and slag materials from local sources that can be obtained at minimal cost.

The expansion timeline calls for construction to begin in October 1912, with completion targeted for March 1913. Mr. Riley emphasized the importance of maintaining continuous operations during construction.

**Decision:** Approve facility expansion as presented. Authorize expenditure of $2,800 for construction and equipment installation.

## AGENDA ITEM 4: WORKFORCE AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

Mr. McKenna reported on current staffing levels and safety practices. The tannery employs 18 workers across all shifts, with plans to add 6 additional workers to support expanded production.

**Current Safety Practices:**
- Workers provided with rubber aprons and boots
- Adequate ventilation maintained in processing areas
- First aid supplies available on-site
- Weekly safety reminders provided to all workers

Mr. McKenna noted that some workers have complained about skin irritation from chemical exposure, but stated that such complaints are common in tannery operations and do not represent unusual safety concerns. He recommended continuing current practices while ensuring workers understand the importance of following established procedures.

Mr. Riley emphasized that the company's safety obligations extend to providing reasonable protective equipment and maintaining sanitary working conditions. He noted that tannery work inherently involves exposure to chemicals and that workers accept these conditions as part of their employment.

**Decision:** Maintain current safety protocols. Add safety orientation for new workers hired during expansion.

## AGENDA ITEM 5: REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS

Mr. Riley addressed recent inquiries from the Massachusetts State Board of Health regarding industrial operations in the Woburn area. He noted that the tannery has received no specific citations or complaints, and current operations appear to be in compliance with applicable regulations.

The discussion included consideration of the tannery's relationship with neighboring properties and the broader East Woburn community. Mr. Riley noted that the facility provides valuable employment opportunities for local residents and contributes to the industrial development of the area.

**Community Considerations:**
- No formal complaints received from neighboring property owners
- Tannery operations consistent with industrial character of the area
- Employment provided to 18 local residents
- Railroad access supports broader industrial development

Mr. Riley stated that the company's primary responsibility is to its shareholders, employees, and customers. While the company seeks to maintain good relations with the community, operational decisions must be based on sound business principles and regulatory compliance rather than speculative concerns about potential future impacts.

**Decision:** Continue current operations in accordance with applicable regulations. Monitor for any specific complaints or regulatory changes that might affect operations.
