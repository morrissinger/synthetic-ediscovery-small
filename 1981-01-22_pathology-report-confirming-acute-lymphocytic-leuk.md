## CLINICAL HISTORY

James Anderson was a 12-year-old white male with a nine-year history of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), initially diagnosed in January 1972 at age 3 years, 6 months. The patient resided at 11 Orange Street, Woburn, Massachusetts, with his mother Anne Anderson and siblings Christine Anderson (age 20) and Charles Anderson (age 16). 

The patient's clinical course was characterized by multiple remissions and relapses despite aggressive chemotherapy protocols including vincristine, prednisone, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine. His most recent relapse occurred in September 1980, with progressive deterioration despite salvage therapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Terminal complications included severe pancytopenia, recurrent infections, and central nervous system involvement.

The patient expired on January 18, 1981, at 14:32 hours following respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia in the setting of profound immunosuppression.

## GROSS EXAMINATION

The body is that of a thin, pale, chronically ill-appearing 12-year-old white male measuring 142 cm in length and weighing 28.5 kg (significantly below the 5th percentile for age). The body shows evidence of chronic illness with muscle wasting and pallor consistent with prolonged anemia.

**External Examination:**
Multiple healed central venous catheter sites are present on the anterior chest. Petechial hemorrhages are noted on the extremities and trunk, consistent with thrombocytopenia. No acute external trauma is identified.

**Internal Examination:**

**Cardiovascular System:** The heart weighs 180 grams (normal for age: 150-200g). The myocardium shows mild pallor but no acute changes. Coronary arteries are patent. No vegetations or thrombi identified.

**Respiratory System:** Both lungs show consolidation of the lower lobes with purulent exudate consistent with bacterial pneumonia. The right lung weighs 420 grams, left lung 380 grams (normal combined weight for age: 400-500g). Pleural surfaces show fibrinous deposits.

**Hematopoietic System:** The bone marrow is hypercellular with 85% lymphoblasts, confirming active leukemic involvement. The spleen is enlarged, weighing 280 grams (normal for age: 80-120g), with diffuse leukemic infiltration. Lymph nodes throughout the body are enlarged and replaced by leukemic tissue.

**Gastrointestinal System:** The liver weighs 1,240 grams (normal for age: 800-1,200g) and shows hepatomegaly with leukemic infiltration. No acute pathology identified in the remainder of the GI tract.

**Genitourinary System:** Kidneys show mild leukemic infiltration but maintain normal architecture. Combined weight 180 grams (normal for age: 150-200g).

**Central Nervous System:** Brain weight 1,350 grams (normal for age: 1,300-1,400g). Microscopic examination reveals leukemic infiltration of the meninges and perivascular spaces, consistent with CNS leukemia.

## MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION

**Bone Marrow:** Hypercellular marrow with 85% lymphoblasts. The blasts are medium-sized with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, fine chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining shows coarse granular positivity in the lymphoblasts, consistent with acute lymphocytic leukemia, L2 subtype according to French-American-British (FAB) classification.

**Spleen:** Complete architectural effacement by sheets of lymphoblasts identical to those seen in bone marrow. Red pulp congestion with hemosiderin deposition.

**Liver:** Portal and sinusoidal infiltration by leukemic cells. Hepatocytes show mild fatty change, likely secondary to chemotherapy.

**Lungs:** Acute bronchopneumonia with gram-positive cocci identified on tissue Gram stain. Alveolar spaces filled with neutrophils, fibrin, and bacterial organisms. Leukemic infiltration present in perivascular areas.

**Brain:** Leptomeningeal infiltration by lymphoblasts with extension into Virchow-Robin spaces. No acute hemorrhage or mass lesions identified.

**Lymph Nodes:** Complete replacement of normal architecture by leukemic lymphoblasts.

## SPECIAL STUDIES

**Immunohistochemistry:** Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) positive in blast cells, confirming lymphoblastic origin.

**Cytogenetics:** Previous bone marrow analysis from November 1980 showed hyperdiploid karyotype with 53-55 chromosomes, consistent with poor prognosis ALL.

**Microbiology:** Tissue cultures from lung specimens grew *Streptococcus pneumoniae* sensitive to penicillin.

## FINAL ANATOMIC DIAGNOSES

**Primary Diagnosis:**
1. Acute lymphocytic leukemia, L2 subtype (FAB classification), relapsed/refractory
   - Bone marrow involvement (85% blasts)
   - Hepatosplenomegaly with leukemic infiltration
   - Generalized lymphadenopathy
   - Central nervous system involvement (leptomeningeal)

**Secondary Diagnoses:**
2. Acute bacterial pneumonia (*Streptococcus pneumoniae*)
3. Severe pancytopenia secondary to leukemia and chemotherapy
4. Chronic malnutrition and failure to thrive
5. Multiple complications of chronic illness and treatment

**Immediate Cause of Death:** Respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia

**Underlying Cause of Death:** Acute lymphocytic leukemia

## COMMENT

This 12-year-old male died of complications related to relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia after a nine-year battle with the disease. The pathologic findings are consistent with aggressive, refractory ALL with widespread organ involvement including bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, and central nervous system.

The patient's clinical history is notable for diagnosis at the unusually young age of 3 years, 6 months, and the aggressive nature of his disease despite multiple treatment protocols. The hyperdiploid cytogenetics identified in previous studies are associated with poor prognosis in pediatric ALL.

Terminal pneumonia in the setting of profound immunosuppression from both the underlying malignancy and intensive chemotherapy represents a common cause of death in pediatric leukemia patients.

This case contributes to the documented cluster of childhood leukemia cases in the East Woburn area, which has prompted ongoing epidemiological investigation by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
