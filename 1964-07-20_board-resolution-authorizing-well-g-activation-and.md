**WHEREAS,** the existing water supply infrastructure consisting of Wells A, B, C, D, E, and F has reached capacity limitations during peak summer demand periods, particularly affecting water pressure in the eastern sections of the city; and

**WHEREAS,** the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has conducted preliminary testing and evaluation of the newly constructed Well G facility located at coordinates 42°28'15"N, 71°09'30"W, approximately 800 feet east of the Aberjona River in the East Woburn section of the city; and

**WHEREAS,** Well G has been drilled to a depth of eighty-eight (88) feet and equipped with a submersible pump system capable of delivering up to 400 gallons per minute to the municipal distribution network; and

**WHEREAS,** initial water quality testing conducted by the State Department of Public Health laboratory in Jamaica Plain has indicated that Well G water meets all applicable standards set forth in the Massachusetts Sanitary Code, Chapter IV, Section 10.00 et seq., for public water supply systems; and

**WHEREAS,** the City Engineer has certified that all necessary transmission mains, connecting pipes, and distribution infrastructure have been installed in accordance with applicable municipal codes and engineering specifications; and

**WHEREAS,** the Board of Public Works has determined that activation of Well G is necessary and appropriate to meet the growing water supply needs of the city's residents, particularly those residing in the eastern neighborhoods bounded by Main Street (Route 38), Montvale Avenue, and the Wilmington town line; and
