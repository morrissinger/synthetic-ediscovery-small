**RE:** Initial Water Quality Assessment - Wells G and H

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the initial water quality assessment for municipal Wells G and H, conducted between March 15-30, 1974, following standard testing protocols established by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Both wells have been operational since 1964 (Well G) and 1966 (Well H) respectively, providing supplemental water supply to the East Woburn distribution system. Current analysis indicates compliance with existing federal and state drinking water standards, though certain parameters warrant continued monitoring.

## WELL SPECIFICATIONS

### Well G (Municipal Well #7)
- **Location:** Mishawum Road, East Woburn
- **Depth:** 180 feet
- **Casing:** 12-inch steel, grouted to 40 feet
- **Pump Capacity:** 400 gallons per minute
- **Service Area:** East Woburn residential district
- **Operational Status:** Active since May 1964

### Well H (Municipal Well #8)
- **Location:** Salem Street, East Woburn
- **Depth:** 165 feet
- **Casing:** 12-inch steel, grouted to 35 feet
- **Pump Capacity:** 350 gallons per minute
- **Service Area:** East Woburn residential district
- **Operational Status:** Active since August 1966

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

Water samples were collected from both wells on March 15, 20, 25, and 30, 1974, following Massachusetts Department of Public Health sampling protocols. Samples were collected directly from well heads after five-minute pump operation to ensure representative groundwater sampling. All samples were transported in sterilized glass containers to the State Laboratory Institute in Jamaica Plain for analysis within 24 hours of collection.

Testing parameters included:
- Bacteriological analysis (coliform count)
- Chemical analysis (chloride, nitrate, fluoride)
- Physical properties (turbidity, color, odor)
- Heavy metals screening (iron, manganese)
- pH and alkalinity measurements

## ANALYTICAL RESULTS

### Well G Results (March 1974 Average)

| Parameter | Result | Unit | State Standard | Federal Standard |
|-----------|---------|------|----------------|------------------|
| Coliform Count | <1 | per 100ml | <1 | <1 |
| Chloride | 28 | mg/L | 250 | 250 |
| Nitrate | 2.1 | mg/L | 10 | 10 |
| Fluoride | 0.3 | mg/L | 2.0 | 2.0 |
| Iron | 0.15 | mg/L | 0.30 | 0.30 |
| Manganese | 0.08 | mg/L | 0.05 | 0.05 |
| pH | 7.2 | units | 6.5-8.5 | 6.5-8.5 |
| Turbidity | 1.2 | NTU | 5.0 | 5.0 |
| Color | 8 | units | 15 | 15 |
| Odor | None | - | None | None |

### Well H Results (March 1974 Average)

| Parameter | Result | Unit | State Standard | Federal Standard |
|-----------|---------|------|----------------|------------------|
| Coliform Count | <1 | per 100ml | <1 | <1 |
| Chloride | 31 | mg/L | 250 | 250 |
| Nitrate | 1.8 | mg/L | 10 | 10 |
| Fluoride | 0.4 | mg/L | 2.0 | 2.0 |
| Iron | 0.22 | mg/L | 0.30 | 0.30 |
| Manganese | 0.09 | mg/L | 0.05 | 0.05 |
| pH | 7.0 | units | 6.5-8.5 | 6.5-8.5 |
| Turbidity | 1.8 | NTU | 5.0 | 5.0 |
| Color | 12 | units | 15 | 15 |
| Odor | None | - | None | None |

## FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

Both Wells G and H demonstrate compliance with current Massachusetts Department of Public Health and federal drinking water standards for all tested parameters. Bacteriological analysis indicates no presence of coliform bacteria, confirming microbiological safety of the water supply. Chemical analysis reveals acceptable levels of common groundwater constituents.

**Notable Observations:**

1. **Manganese Levels:** Both wells show manganese concentrations slightly above the state standard of 0.05 mg/L, though within acceptable ranges for consumption. This is consistent with natural groundwater conditions in the Woburn area.

2. **Iron Content:** Iron levels remain within acceptable limits but approach the maximum allowable concentration, particularly in Well H.

3. **Chloride Levels:** Chloride concentrations are well below maximum allowable limits and consistent with natural groundwater chemistry in the region.

4. **Physical Properties:** Water from both wells exhibits good physical characteristics with low turbidity and acceptable color levels.

## OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

Wells G and H continue to provide reliable water supply to the East Woburn service area, with combined daily production averaging 450,000 gallons during peak demand periods. The wells operate on automatic controls responding to distribution system pressure requirements.

Recent maintenance activities include:
- Pump inspection and bearing replacement (Well G, February 1974)
- Electrical system upgrade (Well H, January 1974)
- Routine well head inspection and security verification

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on current testing results, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Continue Quarterly Testing:** Maintain regular water quality monitoring schedule in accordance with state requirements.

2. **Monitor Manganese Levels:** Conduct monthly manganese testing for both wells to track any increasing trends.

3. **Expand Testing Parameters:** Consider including additional chemical parameters in future testing protocols as analytical capabilities expand.

4. **Well Maintenance:** Continue routine pump and electrical system maintenance to ensure reliable operation.

5. **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive records of all testing results and operational data for regulatory compliance and historical reference.

## REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

This assessment confirms that Wells G and H meet all applicable water quality standards established by:
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Division of Water Supply
- United States Public Health Service Drinking Water Standards
- Safe Drinking Water Act provisions (pending federal implementation)

## CONCLUSION

Wells G and H continue to provide safe, potable water to East Woburn residents in compliance with all current regulatory standards. Regular monitoring and maintenance will ensure continued reliable operation and water quality protection. No immediate corrective actions are required based on current testing results.
